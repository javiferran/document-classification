The governor of tobacco-
growing North Carolina Mon-
day attacked the Surgeon
General's report linking
smoking with various daseas-
es as t'&amp;lstng more questions
than it snswered.
"The report raised a lot of
questions, but it didn't find
the anrwers," Cov. Terry
Sanford told the aNtual con-
ventton of the National Asso-
ciation of Tobacco Distrib-
uters at the Fontainebleau
Hotel.
"Thls report Is by no

Sanford, governor of the
nation's chief tubacco-produc-
tng and processing state, seld,
"I don't In any way disctrdlt
the report to the Surgeon
General.
"But when I am asked If It

Sanford listed five specific
criticisms of the Surgeon
General's Report on Smoking
and Health:
IN TWO PLACES the
report says that "statistical
methods cannot esta bltsh
proof of a causal relationship
in an association. Yet the
report proceeds to rely on

MIA11sI BEACH. Fla (AP) -
North Carolma Gov. Terry San-
ford made a prediction Monday
of "new levels of growth and
prosperity" for the tobacco in-
dustry "once it is freed from the
clouds of health consideraaons"
by research into the cause of
cancer and heart disease
Addressing Ihe National As-
sociabon of Tobacco Arstribu-
lors, Sanford said the govern-
ment report on 9noking "raised
a lot of questions but didtt't find
the answers"
Sanford, governor of a stale
that produces two-thirds of the
natioa a tah;,cco. challenged the
basis on uhi;h he said "exces-
sively dedu .drd ref;ulalois"
were seekiog to take tobacco
away from its users.
°Nhat" he asked, "would
satisfy the psychological needs
of the 70 million Americans who
amoked in 1969, if thcy were
suddenly deprived or tobacco?"
Anti-smoking campaigns of
today, he said. are being waged
"pruearily with statistical cor
relations of one kind or att•
other."
Declaring that the govern-
ment report "doesn't pin down
the condemaation of tobacco,"
be proposed a continuing titady
of tobacco "lo identtfy and
eliminate the suspected health
risks." and a more Intensive
study of cancer and heart ail•
ments.
Ganlord aeid that since 1gOg
the annual death rate from ma-
jor luag ailments has fallen by
84 per cent, during a period
which cigarette atttoking was on
the mcreose.
Sarrnrd hit at what he called
incnn•-ctencles in the recent ne-
port nt the U.S. surgemt general
linkir.• cigarette smoking and
lun: r ancer.
"I r+n nnt In arw way discrcdit
the rc,~nrl to the surgeon gen-
e• d." -akl Sanford. "But when
t am isked if ft doesn't pin
dnr n Ib^ condemnation of Ie•
bs •co, once and for all, my
ans+rer rs, emphalicalw, that tl
doe,, not "
Fanford called altenlion to
statisrical ourveys md used by
the adusat•• committee and cit-
ed the incidence of lung cancer
in aon-sr.iokers.
Fle predicted the tobacco in-
dustry would attain new peaks
or prosperity "once it is freed
from the cloud of health consid-
erat•ions by scientific research
and discovery imh, htr tuae
causes of cancer And rh,e;.;es
of the heart and respiratory
syslems ••
Sanford, who smokes an ot:ca-
slonal cigar, tromes from a
atate which produces most of
the nation's flue-cured tobacco
and manufactures 60 per ced
of its cigarettes.
He said tobacco has bepn
plagued by health scarea since
Sir Walter Raleigh first impottr
ed the leaf to England.
"Each century has had Its
dedicated forces." he stated,
"who were positive that the
world's Bls could be traced to
totacco and that immortality
and the millenium would some-
how be achieved if tobacco
were abolished."
Sanford said Ihe surgeon
general's report states that a
casual relationship cannot be
established by statistical meth-
ods, ald yet "as far as I can
determine, the report proceeds
to rely on statistics to arrive at
its conclusions which condemn
smoking.
"The further fact Is that this
report does not specify any sub-
stance in tobacco smoke that
would account for causing a dis-
ease," Sanford added. "And
yet how maq, people realize
this, among the millions of
Americans to whom the report
was conveyed as an offlcial
finding on the smoking end
health question.
"I believe that most .1mra-
l:ans wiW any horse %rn+c %%dl
recogelze that in all 'thi+igs nf
life, excesses should be aioid-
ed - and this applies to onr
speed in aulomobi:es, ir eur
