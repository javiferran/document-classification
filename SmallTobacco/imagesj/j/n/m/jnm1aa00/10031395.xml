R7ilERE THERE'S SHf01KE. . .
If you watch television with any de-
gree of regularity, it may seem evident to
you that salesmanship is responsible for
the report that at the end of 1956, the
filter-tio variety has captured nearly one-
third of the American cigaret market.
On the other hand, science, fear or
superstition may have had equally as
much to do with this change in the Amer-
lcan cigaret smoker's habits.
Thirteen billion more cigarets were
smoked during 1°56 in spite of increasing
reports linking smoking with lung can-
cer. From this, it may be deduced that
tohile the catchy jingles and dramatiza-
tions that are presented over TV may
have had a great deal to do with filter-tip
cigaret sales' increase, the compelling de-
sire of smokers to put something between
themselves and the possible harmful ef-
fects of tobacco cannot be discounted.
So the scare lingers on, -while a prob-
ably fictitious faith is being placed In the
wide variety of filters on cigarets.
Cigaret companies for many years
sought a mild tobacco. Growers snught
to supply this demand by carefully breed-
ing plants that would turn out a tobacco
leaf low In nicotine.
Now the rush seems to be toward the
filtered variety of dgarets. so in order to
get some flavor through to the smoker,
stronger tobaccos are preferred. The
practice has been for the best tobaccos
to go into standard aagarets, while the
harsher blends are put in front of the
filters. Therefore, the flight to filter-tips
may In teality be a rush to the kind of
tobacco that does the most damage to
health.
No one has yet proved conclusively
that there Is any harmtul effect from
smoking. but the new trend, induced by
the possibilty of such dangers, is causing
nothing but confusion to bobacco famers
and plant breeders.
The most confused people in the whole
sitaatioa, however, may be those smokers
who, to reduce their fears about the peril.
If any, from smoking are puttir,g then-
gehm behind filUers but by no means aut
of all aossible harm's wav.

in Lung Coaos,
Specific laboratory proof
that cigarette smoking causes
cancer o[ the lungs has not
been adduced, but five experts
conducting a pulmonary dis-
ease clinic at the University
of Kansas Medical Center toa
day agreed that clinical rec-
ords indicate a relationship
between heavy smoking and
such cancers.
HoWever, added the experts,
smoking likely is only one of
several air poIIutions in city
life today ihat may be boost-
ing the remarkable rise in
lung cancers. The other po1•
lutions:
Motor car exhausts, especi-
ally from use of high-ocWne
gasohnes.
Fumes Pervade Alr.
Coal fire fumes, more heavy
in European than American
citles, from home and factory
chimneys.
Fuel oil and oil refinery
fumes from homes or fac-
tories.
Heavy use of macadams and
tars for road surfacing.
The e.tperts polled here are
Dr. John McClement of Colum-
bia university, Dr. Hurley
Motley of the University of
Southern California. Dr. How-

Cleveland clinic, Dr. Julius
Wilson of the University of
Pennsylvania and Dr. Martin
F'itzPatrick, head of the lung
disease section of the K. U.
center.

is not the only lung affliction
which may be lncited by amok-
