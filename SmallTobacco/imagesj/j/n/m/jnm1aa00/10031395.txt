WHERE THERE'S SMOKE...

If you watch television with any de-
gree of regularity. it may seem evident to
you that salesmanship is responsible for
the report that at the end of 1956, the
filter-tin variety has captured nearly one-
third of the American cigaret market.

On the other hand, science, fear or
superstition may have had equally as
much todo with this change in the Amer-
can cigaret smoker's habits.

Thirteen billion more cigarets were
smoked during 1956 in spite of increasing
reports linking smoking with lung can-
cer. From this, it may be deduced that
while the catchy jingles and dramatiza-
tions that are presentcd over TV may
have had a great deal to do with filter-tip
cigaret sales’ increase, the compelling de-
sire of smokers to put something between
themselves and the possible harmful ef-
fects of tobacco cannot be discounted.

So the scare lingers on, -while a prob-
ably fictitious faith is being placed in the
wide variety of filters on cigarets.

Cigaret companies for many years
sought a mild tobacco. Growers sought
to supply this demand by carefully breed-
ing plants that would turn out a tobacco
leaf low in nicotine.

Now the rush seems to be toward the
filtered variety of cigarets, so jn order to
get some flavor through to the smoker,
stronger tobaccos are preferred. The
practice has been for the best tebaccos
to go into standard cigarets, while the
harsher blends are put in front of the
filters. Therefore. the flight to filter-tips
may in reality be a rush to the kind of
tobacco that does the most damage to
health.

No one has yet proved conclusively
that there is any harmful effect from
smoking. but the new trend, induced by
the possibilty of such dangers, is causing
nothing but confusion to tobacco farmers
and plant breeders.

The most confused people in the whole
situation, however, may be those smokers
who, to reduce their fears about the peril,
if any, from smoking are putting them-
elves behind filters but by no means cut
of all possible harm's wav.

A SMOKING TIE 70 CANCER

EXPERTS HERE AGREE RE.
LATIONSHIP EXISTS.

Other Forms of Air Pollution
Probably Holp Boost Riso
in Lung Casas,

 

Specific laboratory proof
that cigarette smoking causes
cancer of the lungs has not
been adduced, but five experts
conducting a pulmonary dis-
ease clinic at the University
of Kansas Medical Center to-
day agreed that clinical rec-
ords indicate a relationship
between heavy smoking and
such cancers,

However, added the experts,
smoking likely is only one of
several air pollutions in city
life today ihat may be boost-
ing the remarkable rise in
lung cancers. The other pol:
lutions:

Motor car exhausts, especi-
ally from use of high-octane
gasolines.

Fumes Pervade Air.

Coal fire fumes, more heavy
in European than American
cities, from home and factory
chimneys.

Fuel oil and oil refinery
fumes from homes or fac-
tories.

Heavy use of macadams and
tars for road surfacing.

The experts polled here are
Dr. Jobn McClement of Colum-
bia university, Dr. Hurley
Motley of the University of
Southern California. Dr. How-
ard Van. Orstrand of the
Cleveland clinic, Dr. Julius
Wilson of the University of
Pennsylvania and Dr. Martin
FitePatrick, head of the lung
disease section of the K. U.
center.

The five also agreed cancer
is not the only lung affliction
which may be inc!ted by smok-
ing and other pollutants.
These aggravants often are
factors in bronchitis (inflam-
mation of the bronchial tubes).
which, when chronic, may
bring on emphysema, a dis-
erder in the lungs’ ability to
oxpel air.
