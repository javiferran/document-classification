In a nation which puffs 130 packs of cigarets ;

Mr, Klsepfer

Proven a cause of lung cancer

illnesses,

 

“We don't claim the product

five or six filter-tipmentholat-
eds during the one-hour pres:

“The cigaret isn’t exoner-

ated, but it is still oa trial.”
‘THE INSTITUTES position,
emphatically put by statist
{. clan Marvin Kastenbaum, is
Sv, that a statistical correlation

among
smokers than nonsmokers) is
not proof of cause and effect.

Employing two-tcreen visual
aids, Kloepfer lambasted a
plece of research highly pubti-
clzed by the American Cancer
Society early last year. That
ploject reported ung cancers
had been generated in 12 out of
85 beagle dogs subjected in a
laboratory to cigaret smoke
| inhalation for more than two

    
  

years.

Kloepfer said the Tobacco
Twi Institute has been refused ac-
cess to the basic data behind
the cancer society’s report.

‘The Washington-based trade | was rejected tor publication in

ithe Journal of the American
Medical Assn., and when it
final'y appeared in another
scientific journal, its findings
were watered down. The print-
ed version declared only two
dogs to have cancer signs and
these, “microscopic.”
According to Kloepfer, this
experiment cost government
and private sources $750,000.

; ‘The leading source of funds for
lresearch on smoking and

health, he said, is the tobacco
industry itself, to the tune of
about $4% million this year,

has pre-judged cigaret smok-
ing as a lung cancer cause and
federal regulatory agencies
have “made the science fit the
ied policies,”*

Since smoking-causes-can-
cer'is taken as revealed truth,
negative evidence tends to be
disregarded, the tobacco itr
dustry says. Peaple who de-
fend cigarets as “not yet prov-
en guilty” begia to feel like
lonely members of a “Bat
earth society.”

But statistician. Kavtenbaum.
claimed some figures cast
doubt on a direct smoking-can-
cer link.

Women have been smoking
for many years now, be said,
but fall victim to lung cancer
Jess than men in @ “6 to 1
ratio,”

‘The British stoke ag much
‘ad Americans but have twice
the lung cancer rate. One
study found a correlation be
tween smoking and bladder
cancer; but a follow-up. also
found certain coincidence of
bladder cancer with coffee-
drinking. .

cance?,” said Kastenbaum,
citing a study of autopsies that
showed 59 per cent error in
lung cancer diagnosis.

ACCORDING TO Kasten
‘baum, smoking has been iden-
tified statistically with 22 caus
es of death “including acci-
dents and suicide.”

This may only be a clue, he
said, that people who smoke
also follow a manner of life
which subjects them to various
causes of death
The fact that some persons
— and even 200 animals ~~
contract tung cancer without
ever smoking must’ mean
there are at feast some other
causes, said the speakers. Air
pollution, maybe.

“We may be diverting re .
search from the real causes of -

cancer,” said Kloepfer, who
added ‘that government ‘has @
duty “to provide information,
but not control individual be-
havior.” :

“What are you worried
about, then?” asked a news-

fingers.

KLOEPFER indicated any:
