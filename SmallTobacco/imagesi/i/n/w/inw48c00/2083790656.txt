Leslie gets his first
Grand National win

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

. CLERMONT, Ind. — Tracy
Leslie, taking advantage of spins
and wrecks that sidelined the
frontrunners, beat David Green to
the finish line by .73 seconds Satur-
day night in winning the Kroger
200 NASCAR Grand National race
at Indianapolis Raceway Park.

The victory was the first in 77

- Grand National starts for Leslie,

“T can’t say enough about the
crew. They did it,” Leslie said. “We
don’t know how many bumps (the
Oldsmobile) has on it and now it's
gt one on the roof’ from where

slie stood on it in victory circle.

“But we don’t care.”

Todd Bodine and Robert
Pressley were fighting for the lead
on lap 172 when they came up on
the slower Buick of Troy Beebe.
Pressley’s Chevrolet took the low
side and Bodine’s Chevy the high,
and ‘all three spun into the wail.
Tommy Houston’s Ford, running
third at the time, also became in-
volved, as did the Chevys of Larry
Pearson and Steve Grissom. A red
flag was shown to stop the field
while tracks crews cleaned up the
mess.

No drivers were hurt.

Winston Cup veteran Terry
Labonte rallied from three laps
down to take third with Burton
coming home fourth.

Polesitter Ernie Irvan was the
fastest car on the track much of the
night but his Chevy blew an engine
on lap 151.

 

Mansell wins Marlboro

BROOKLYN, Mich. — Nigel
Mansell ignored the bumpy track
and shrugged off a raging headache
to hold off teammate Mario
Andretti_ and win Sunday's Marl-

boro 500 at Michigan International
Speedway.

Mansell, running only the second
500-mile race of his career, domi-
nated the 250-lap race on the 2-
mile, high-banked oval and re-
gained the IndyCar PPG Cup point
lead from Emerson Fittipaldi, who
struggled to a 13th-place finish on
the hot, humid afternoon.

The Briton, who was the Formu-
la One champion last season, took
the lead from pole-winner Andretti
on the 28th lap and led 2 of the last
221 Japs, including the final 167.

Mansell, who finished third to
Fittipaldi in May in his first India-
napolis 500, had more problems
with the rough track and the heat
on Sunday than he did with any
other driver in the 23-car ficid.

“The circuit is just fantastic,” he
said. “It stands alone, just like Indi-
anapolis. P've never driven anything
like it in my life and it’s beaten me.
Tm glad there wasn’t another 10
laps because I was hanging in there

just at the end and I don’t mind '

telling the world I'm tired.”

Mensell crossed the finish line
9.434 seconds ahead of Andretti,
with Arie Luyendyk of the Nether-
lands, who was the Indy runnerup,
a lap down in third and Boesel an-
other lap back in fourth.
