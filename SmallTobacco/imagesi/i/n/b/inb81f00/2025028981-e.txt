97 per cent of the total. came from
cigarette smokers.”

_ The institute quoted a report by.

the Tax Council, another industiy-
organization with headquarters in
Richmond, Va., as’ stating:

“No one would contend that cig- .

arettes should escape taxation.
However, it is unreasonable to sin-
gle out cigarettes for discrimina..
tory tax burdens. Cigarettes have
become the subject of: tax exploi-
tation.”

State taxes range from 2 to 8:
cents a pack and federal taxes 8:
cents a. pack, adding $1 to $1.60!
per carton of cigarettes, the insti-
tute said. .

On the average, the Tax Council
report ‘said; nearly half the:cost of
‘a pack of cigarettes goes: for tax-
es. “If automobiles were taxed at
the same rate as cigarettes, a new
$3,000 car would cost about $6,-
000," the council said. ©
’ The institute said’ the average
cigarette smoker pays $47.45 a
year in special excise taxes.

Tobacco growers receive an av-
arage of: about 3% cents for the
tobacco in a pack of cigarettes,
the Tax Council: said, adding:

“The federal and: state govern.
ments together impose taxes aver-
aging 13 cents per package, or
four ime} as much as the grow.
ers. receive.”
