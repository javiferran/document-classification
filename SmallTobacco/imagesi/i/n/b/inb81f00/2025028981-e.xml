However, it is unreasonable to sin-

tory tax burdens. Cigarettes have
become the subject of tax exploi-
tation."
State taxes range from 2 to 8':
cents a pack and federal taxes 8:
cents a pack, adding $1 to $1.60
per carton of' cigarettes, the in.cti-
tute said.
On the average, the Tax Council
report'said, nearly half the cost of
-a pack of cigarettes goes for tax-
es. "If automobiles were taxed at
the same rate as cigarettes, a new
.S3;0D0 car would cost about $6,-
000," the council said. The institute said' the average
cigarette smoker pays $47.45 a
year in special excise taxes.
Tobacco growers receive an av-
xrage'ob about 3% cents for the
tobacco in a pack of cigarettes,
the Tax Council said, adding:
"The federal and: state govern-
ment's together impose taxes aver.
ag.ing 13 cents per package, or
(otir imes as much as the grow.
ers receive."

Of Tobacco Users
WASflINGTON (UPI.) - The
per capita tobacco tax throughout
the nation last' year was $5.91 and
the American tobacco user is be-
ing exploited, a tobacco industry
publication has charged.
More than half the cost of a pack
of cigarettes goes. into taxes, ac-
cording to Tobacco News, the To-
bacco Institute, Inc. publication.
Tobacco News, citing,Tobacco
Tax Council figures, reported that
47states and the district of Colum-
bia last year collected ;1al billion
from tobacco users. Added to fed-
ual,levies, this means that Ameri-
cans shelled out abont $3-2 billion
in tazes alone for their tobacco
prodnets.
State governments in particular
were accused of discrirqinating,
against the tobacco user. Figures
showed that during the past seven
years state tobacco taxes have
raore than doubt-ed, a4d this year,
several legislatures voted even •
larger increases,
