miles and many laps that the en-

Sald Penske: “We ran 4,532
miles (with the Mercedes engine}
prior to coming here, and we've run
probably 4,000 miles here. In all
‘that, we've had one sensor come on
for oil pressure and one beit jump

month as we've had here in four or
five years.”

All of that is bad news for the

223.270 mph.

Raul Boesel, who finished fourth
last year, is considered a top con

falter.

to find out if the Penskes have been
intentionally hiding their advan-

"No doubt the Penskes have a lot

INDIANAPOLIS — Forget it, It's over.

Tell the 400,000 folks corning to the Indi-
anapolis Motor Speedway today not to both-
er. Same for the millions more planning to
watch the Indy 500 oa TV.

Roger Penske already has been con-
ceded his t0th Indy 500 victory. The only
question is which one of his drivers — Al
Unser Jr., Emerson Fittipaldi or Paul
Tracy — will wear the winner's garland.

Mercedes-Benz power under the Peuske
engine covers is reportedly producing from
150 to 300 more horsepower than any of the
conventional turbocharged Indy V8s or
Buick V6és in the 33-car field.

And that’s why the most famous race in
the world could turn into a Penske parade.

Penske, as skilled in business as he is in
racing, took advantage of a rule thal had
been largely ignored by the rest of the Indy-
Car community, He had the new engines
built just for Indianapolis.

The Mercedes power plants are stock-
type, push-rod engines designed and built
by Matio Illien and Paul Morgan, the same

men responsible for the dominating Chev-
rolet Indy V8s of the past decade.

The other 15 races in the IndyCar series
are sanctioned by Championship Auto Rac-
ing Tears, but it is the U.S. Auto Club that
oversees Indianapolis.

Under USAC rules for the Indy 500, the
Mercedes engines are allowed 56 inches of
turbocharger boost, 10 inches more than
the conventional Fords and Ilmors. The
Buicks get the same 55 inches but never
have been able to figure out how to use the

extra air pressure to win the race.

The Penske-Mercedes cars did not over~
whelm the competition in qualifications,
but there are two of them silting boldly at
the front of the field, with Unser on the pole
and defending and two-time race winner
Fittipaldi on the outside of the front row.

Lurking back in the ninth of LI three-car
rows is the third Penske entry, driven by
Tracy, whose qualifying elfort was ham-
pered by a crash during the first week of
practice.

"Tt looks ike Penske has us covered, $0
we're running for best in class,” said Mario
Andrettl, a former winner running his 29th
and final Indy 500.

Even though nobody on Marlboro Team
Penske is willing to admit fo any unfair ad-
Vantage, the confidence rings in their
voices.

“I've never had a car or a team this
ready for victory at Indy,” Unser, the 1992

“For us to doa good lap, we need
‘momentum. They can gel back up
to speed faster than we can, so if
‘we get slowed down an the straight:
away or in the corner, the Penskes
will have the advantage. That’s
what I see, I hope I'm wrong.”

Unser led qualifying with a four-
clap average of 226.011 mph, and

: ‘You have to drive a very smart
race, because it's easy to get too ag-
agressive too soon and make a mis
ptake,” said Scott Brayton, starting

Tdretti’s 29,

you have to use very good judgment

Besides Fittlpaldi, who first won
in 1989, and 1969 winner Andretti,
the other former winners in the
lineup are Unser (1992), Arie
Luyendyk (1990) and Bobby Rahal
{1986}, Andretti, the eldest in the
lineup at 54, is oo am “Arrivederci,
Mario" tour before his retirement
at the end of the season.

Jacques Villeneuve, the fastest
rookie and the youngest driver at
28, will start from the inside of the
second cow, alongside Michael An-
dretti, Mario's son," and Lyn St.
James, the second woman to com-
pete here.

Nigel Mansell, the defending
series champlon, finished third at
Indy last year and will start from
the Inside of the third row, along-
side 1993 runner-up Luyendyk and
the elder Andretti.

John Andretti, Mario’s nephew,
will start behind Mansell in row
four, the first leg of an extremely
difficult double. He plans to race in
both the Indy 50¢ and the National
Association for Stock Car Auto
Raving’s Coca-Cola 600 at Concord,
N.C, later In the day, using helicop-
lers and a private jet to help him
accomplish the feat. But the win-
dow is extremely narrow, with Indy
expected to end shortly after 2 p.m.

and the NASCAR event set fo start
2 hours later. Flying time for the
366-mile trip Is sted at 53 minutes.

Besides Fittipaldi and Boese},
other Brazilians in the lineup are
rookies Mauricie Gugelmin and
Marea Greco. Ait are driving under
the shadow of the May 1 death of
countryman Ayrton Senna, a three-
time Formula One champion killed
in a race crash at Imola, Italy.

“Let's talk about the good things
that (enna) did, what he left us to
be proad of,” Boese) said. “He was
a very great driver and a great
hero in Brazil. This is how we
should remember him. 1 dedicate
my race to him.”

Seott Goodyear was 2 late addi-
tion to the field for the second time
in three years. In 1992, Goadyear’s
quailfied car was bumped on the
final day of time trials. He replaced
then-teammmate Mike Groff,
started 33rd and wound up second
to Unser in the closest Indy finish
ever.

It happened again this year.
Goodyear’s car was the only one
bumped on the final day of the
trials and team owner Kenny Bern-
stein pul him into the car qualified
by teammate Davy Jones. ‘The
Canadian driver again will start
last.

No one has ever won from far-
ther back than 28th.
