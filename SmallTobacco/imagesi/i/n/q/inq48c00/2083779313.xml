A Penske party likely
By Mike Harris
Assa,iawE Press
INDIANAPOLIS - Forget il.It's over.
Tell the 10000 folks ovming to the Indi-
anapolis Motor Speedway today eut to both-
er. Samc for the millions more planning to
watch the lndy 500 on TV.
Roger Penske already has been con-
ceded his IOIh Indy 500 victory. The only
question Is which one of his drsvers - A1
Unser Jr., Fsserson Fittipaldi or Paul
Tracy - will wear the winner s garland.
Mercedes-Benz power under the Penske
engine covers is reportedly producing from
1501o 300 more horsepower than any of the
conventional turboclurged indy Ves or
Buick V6s in the 33-car field.
And that's why lhe most famous race in
the world could tarn into a Penske parade.
Penske, as skilled in business as he is in
racing, took advantage of a rule that had
been largely ignored by the rest of the lndy-
Car community, lie had the new engtnes
built just for Indianapolis.
Asewuieav,en The Mercedea power plants are stock-
DeterGeg charnpon Eo«xson Fttilteldl shows type, push'rod engines designed and built
off his trupby M Satuday's @ivers meetirgj by Mario Illien and Paul Morgan, the same

race winner, said.
"I'm very confident," Filtipaltli
said. "We a e taking a calculated
risk because the numbers are be-
bind ua We have proved with many
miles and many laps that the en
gine is reliable."
Sald Penske: "We ran 4,532
mllrs (with the Mercedcs engine)
prlur to coming here, aad we4e run
probably 4,000 miles here. In all
thal, we've had one sensor cume on
for oil pressure and one belt jump
off. It's been about as clean a
month as we've had here in four or
five Years"
All of Wat is bad news for the
rest of what is the second-fastest
field in Indy history, averaging
223270 0 mph.
Raul Boesel, who finished fourth
last year, is considered a top con-
tender today should the Penskes
falter.
' Starting his LulmFnrd Cosworth
in the middle oflhe front row,BOe-
sel is expectbil to be among lhe first
tu find out if the Penskes have been
intentionally hiding their advantage.
"No doubt the Penskes have a lot
of puwer;' Boesel said. "We just
don't know how much power they
have. Even if I get a very good
rlart, I probably won't be able to
beat them to Me (first) corner.
"Other than the Penskes, it wilt
be a very close field. I don't know
what pace they will have, but they
have the advantage of (more)
straight line speed.
"The picture I have now Istheir
csr is not zs good in the corners as
our ear. Thry come through the
turn off the throttle, then get back
to top speed very fast on the
stralghtaways.
"For us lo do a good lap, we need
mentum_ They can get back up
to speed faster than we can, so if
'we get slowed down on the atraight-
.away or in the corneq the Penekes
will have the advantage. That's
what 1 see. I hope Ym wrong."
Unser ted qualifying with a four-
;lap average of 2Z8.011 mph, and
: Fittlpaldi was the fastest in most of
'ehe daily practice sessions. All
three of fhe Mercedes lit up the
scoring monitors with trap speeds
between 243 mph and 245 mph at
:the end of the back straightaway,
'the fastesl spot on the 29nmile
ovai.
Even the slowest cars In the
field had trap speeds near 230 mph.
'Although it isn't the fastesl, this is
tthe first Indy field with no one
qualified below 220, Rookle Bryan
1Herta, driving for retired lour-time
iwinner A,J. Foyt, was the slowest
lat 220.992 mph.
Add to a possibly dangerous mix
•1he least experienced field in many
;years, with the most rookies (nine)
'aince 1982 and the fewest former.
:winners (five) since 1983.
"You have to drive a very smart
: race, because it's easy to get too ag.
agressive too soon and make a mis.
ateke," said Smtl Brayton, starting
;his 13th race, second only to An-
'drettis 29.
"It's very hard to bold yourself
:baek at the right time, and it seems
anymore thet there isn't any
~waiting game. You go flat cut the
'whole way aod yoa try to get as
; many pasitions as quickly as possl-
,°hle aud try to maintain them, so it
