D11 ET MATERIAL FOUND
TO AFFECT THE RAIN
Discovery Is Already in Use; With
Promising Results, in Treating
One Widespread Disorder
By HAROLD 1K. SC•rLN':ECi.g Sr.
A common dietary substance found in
eggs, meat and fish has surprisingly di-
rect and almost immediate effects on
. brain function, scientists at Nsassachu-
setts Institute of Technology have found.
Their discovery has already been used,
with promising results, in treating one
widespread and disabling brain disorder.
Research is in progress to see if the com-
mon food substance called choline might
also be useful in other brain conditions,
including depression and the memory de-
feots that are an important factor in se-
- 111I:ty. All of these efforts .stem from the dis-
- covery a few years ago that chaline
passes into the blood from food in the
digestive tract, is taken up directlp by
the brain from the circulating blood and
' is used to help the brain make an impor-
t tant chemical transmitter of nerve sig-
r,aL;. On an hour-to-hour basis the
' amount of -the nerve signal transmitter,
in the brain seems to depend on howl
' much choline-rich food the individual has I
e,aten secentdy. ,
. Tius.is very strange,° said Dr. RIchardl
J. Wurtman at an interview in his labora-
tory -in Cambridge, Mass.,. "because it
means that the composition of each meal
wiil directly affect the synthesis of
chemical signais in the bra5n." ' I
For years it had beerr generally believed,
that something called the blood-brainn
barrier- protected the brain from direct
effects of substances either •lacking or
-excessive 1n a day-to-day diet. Only a
few things, notably alcohol and some
powerful drugs such as the narcotics,
wora thought to be exceptions.
Gaps in the Darrier
Recent discovenies show that the blood
. brain barrier •has more gaps tlmn had
been Uiought. Thus, the person who eats
° a large omelet with Yts high choline con-
t_n: will with'n a few hours have rn
2npuly of tt:e nerve si?n1t cra^.s~„~it-
tsr caiidci ceetyicho:ine in ihc brain.
This, according to Dr. Wurtman, will
, mean an amplification of the nerve sig-
nals sent from one nerve cell to the next
by those cells that use acety?choline for
the signaling.
The possible effects of this on behavior
are being studied., _ .....,.
-------'"'the niain practical consaquance that
has emerged from the work to datc is
in the treatment of a common disorder
called ~tatdive dyskinesia. This is a condi-
. ' tion that develops in -many mental. pa-
tients under regular treatment with either
of the rtwo main classes of antipsychotic
. drugs, the phenothiazines or the buty-'
rophenones. These drugs are used to calml
the patients and free them from the acutei
symptoms of their mental illness. ~
After months or years of taking these;
" drugs, patients often develop uncontrolla-'
ble jerking movements of the upper body
and limbs, faciai grimaces and bizarre
movements of t4te tongue. This is the
. chararterist4c pattern of tardive dyskine-i
sia.
-Psyehologically Crippling -
- For a person already handicapped by
, the problems of mental illness these bi-
-zarre movements can be psychologically
crippling. Yet there has been no effective
' treatment for the condition and it has
sometimes been permanent even when
use of the antipsychotic drugs is discon-
tinued. One recent report said that as
many as 40 percent of elderly, chronically
' hospitalized mental patients using the
drugs suffered from tardive dyskinesia
. and that it could be found in 3 percent
or m:ore of a mixed population of inental
patients, including the young.
Those figures indicate that the condi-
n tion probably affects many thousands of
Americans who have taken the drugs for
prolonged periods.
The condition apparent]y results from
a' failure of brain nerve cells to release
enough acetylchoHne. For that reason, as
-' soon as Dr. Wurtman and a graduate
student, Edith L. Cohen, published a re-
port indicafing that rats' brains produed
extra amounts of the transmitter when
Lhey had extra choline in the blood, doc-
tors at Stanford Utii'versity fed choline
, to a tardive dps.iinesda petient to seel
if it world .".elu. I; d:d. i
Last fali, Dr. 0'urtman and three col-
leagues, Dr. John H. Growdon, Madelyn
, Hirsch andDr. William Wiener, published
the results of a carefully controlled study
. in the New England Journal of Medicine,
Qeporting that nine patients fed choline
for two weeks showed major improve-
ment in their dyskinesia symptoms.
Some Believed PJtore Coml.ex j
One patient's symptoms were made l
wrorse and 10 others shot.ed no change.~'
Dr. Wurtman believes this indicates that
the group of patients included some
. whose conditions stemme3 from some-
thing more complex than the classic tar-
dive dyskinesia.
In current studies, the group L~t Boston
Is substituting the choline-richd food sub-
stance lecithin for choli,-te. -
The richest source of lecithin in the
diet, according to- Dr. FVurtman's wife, Pr, Judith Wurtman, is egg yolk, It is
also found in the American a:et as a
widespread and increasingly used food
additive. It is a good emulsifier and has
other properties useful in commercially
prepared cakes, gravies, salad dressings,
beverage mixes and chocotato-cavared
candies. Commercial lecithin contains
about 2 percent to 4 percent choline, Dr.'
Judith VTurtman estimates.
No comparabtcs hypotheses have arisen
yet ft•om the choline studies, but scien-
tists at several institutions.are studying
possible ways in which this chemical can
be used to help the human brain.
Pursuing a clue concerning the -chemi's-
try of memory, for exampie, Dr. David
Dractunan of the University of °N:assachu-
setts at Worcester, is trying chalnie as
a possible help h1 preventing memory loss
among persons suffering from certain;
kinds of senility.
Following another clue, Dr. John Davisk
of the University of Chicago has been~
$*siing the effects of choline in two •
major types of mental illness tiie some-1
times related manic and ' depressive
states. He is working on the hypothesis
that both conditions result fram derange-
ment of a balance between two important .
nerve signal transmitters, norepinephrine
and acetylcholine, with choline too high
in depres5ion and norepin&gt;phrine tooi
high in mania.
