Start Talking To Stop Youth Smoking

 

(NAPSA)-Parents possess a pow-
erful weapon to combat youth
smoking-conversation-but many
stay silent on the topic of tobacco,
not knowing what to say or how to
begin. Yet each day, thousands of
children across the U.S. try their
first cigarette, hoping to fit in. igok
cool, rebel-or simply experiment.

Fortunately, parents now have a
tool to help them begin a dialogue
on not smoking-the “Take {10°
instructional video featuring tips
from Dr. Michael Popkin, founder
and president of Active Parenting
Publishers and the author of more
than 20 parenting books and videos.

The video is part of the "Take 10”
parent education initiative launched
last year as part of the Lorillard
Tobacco Company"s Youth

Smoking Prevention Program. In
addition to the video, which is avail-
able free to leaders of parent groups.

the program also includes the
2takelO.com Web site and a free
brochure.

Any time is a good time

Most parents want family time
together to be stress-free, and check-
ing in with kids about important top-
ics like not smoking isn't easy.

“Kids get uncomfortable easily-
and may back away from any kind
of formal discussion.” says Dr.
Popkin. “Limit the first conversa-
tion to about 10 minutes-to open the
dialogue.”

When there is mutual trust, open
cummunication between parents and
children isn’t far behind. De. Popkin
suggests three simple steps for

 

establishing expectations and build-.

ing trust:

. Listen to your child. Come
from caring, not judgement.

. Teli your child how .you
would feel if he or she tried smok-
ing. Be careful not to lecture.

. Establish consequences,
explain how disappointed you’

would feel or what you would do if

he or she smoked.

Many parents don’t realize how
strong of an impact they can make
by spending a few minutes talking
with their kids-especially about dif-
ficult topics.
