<ot>~,.~Am. Farxn Bureau Holds
7 ? tha Annual Convention
BOYDTON - The 77th annual
Convention of the American Farm
Bureau Federation was held at the
Convention Center in Reno,
Nevada, the week of January 7-11,
1996.
The activities began on Sunday
when the Women's and Young
Farmer's Programs were held.
The~ American Farm, Bureau
Womenannounced that through
:volunteer fund raising, the women
had raised thirty thousand dollars in
private funds to help build and make
operational a fruit and vegetable
cantjing facility in the Western
Ukraine. The check was presented
during the meeting to the Citizens
of Network for Foreign Affairs.
The campaign was launched in Oc-
tober 1994 and after ten Farm
Bureau women spent three weeks in
the Ukraine with the C.N.F.A.
Agribusiness Volunteer Program.
., Moneyy was donated by farm
families across the U. S. and the
project helped to reflect this year's
meeting ; theme "Grasstoots to
Global".
In the, Young Farmer meeting,
the discussion meet was held.
Young frmers from many states
s_, .
engaged in ten rounds of discussions
on previously assigned topics in an
elimination process. The winner
was Casey Niemann of Kansas and
his prize was a new Dodge pickup
truck. The A.F.B.F. Achievement
Award went to Mike DeSutter of B-
linois. He was also the winner of a
new Dodge pickup.
At the opening session, A.F.B.F.
President Dean Kleckner gave an
interestipg and informative address,
speaking to the 5,700+ farmers and
ranchers in attendance. Kleckner serves on the National
commission of Economic growth
and,Tax reform which is chaired by
Jack Kemp. His question was,
"How Big Government and at what
cost?" His philosophy is cut the
,
budget, stop spending, no new,
taxes, and spend within it's means
like all businesses and home owners
must do. We need leaders with an
understanding of budgeting. Farm programs have been "over-
whelmed" by the National Budget
Debate, but Farm Bureau is calling
for adequate financial support for
agricultural research and market
development programs.. These pro-
grams are agriculture's future.
Dollars spent in these areas are
returned many times over. Last year the United States sold
approximately $53 billion of
agricultural goods to foreign buyers
and lt is expected that this year's
sales will reach $58 billion. Farm
Bureau will continue to work to ex-
pand trade throughout the world:
Kleckner also pledged that Farm
Bureau will continue to seek proper-
ty rights protection and common
sense reform of environmental
regulations and the Endangered
Species Act.
Kleckner stressed thafcutting the
capital gains tax rate, raising the
Estate Tax exemption level, in-
creasing the deductions of self
employed health insurance, and
providing enhanced depreciation
schedules must remain tied to farm
program approval as these measures
will affect farmers in a positive
manner.
The farmers and ranchers atten-
ding the convention also heard talks
by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch, who
is Chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
Ed Madigan, Secretary of
Ariculture, spoke to all county
presidents in attendance at a lun-
cheon on Monday.
., Speed skater Bonnie Blair ad- `
dressed the group on Tuesday.,In ,
her "speech, she stressed "Set goals
and be dedicated, have a balance in
your life, and don't be afriad to take
risks: These,three things apply to
life no matter if you are a farmer,
a speed skater or any. other profes-
sion in ivhich you are engaged."

workshops on many topics during
the week. Some of these topics in-
cluded Risk Management, Precision
Farming, , Property Rights, Tax
Reform, Dairy, Beef Cattle," ,
