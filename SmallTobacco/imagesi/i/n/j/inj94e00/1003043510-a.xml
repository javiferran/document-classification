`tl' Paper
Surviving
Ad Loss
In its second week of pub-
-lication, the University of
Minnesota student newspa
per is not suffering any
"economic setbacks" from
the loss of cigarette adver-
tising in its pages.
The Minnesota Daily, the
largest of the 37 college
dailies in the nation (30,000 '
circulation) learned lPst June
that major tobacco manu-
facturers were cacelling ciga-
rette advertising in college
newspapers.
Cigarette advertising had
accounted for' 9.2%e of the-
Daily's total advertising reve-
nue. In national advertising,
cigarette and tobacco ads
totalled 31 %.
Paul Fitzgerald, business
manager of .the Daily said all
but one of the manufacturers
(Marlboro cigarettes) have
cancelled their advertising.
Fitzgerald said that the Marl-
boro Co., had an advertising
contract with the Daily for
the rest of the year.
According t'o Fitzgerald,
the lost' revenue will be
made up by raising local ad.
vertising rates and increas-
ing the amount of local ad-
vertising. The i n c r e a s e
would be about 5 per cent.
