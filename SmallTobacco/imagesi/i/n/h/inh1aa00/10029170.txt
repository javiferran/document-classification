The governor of tobacco-
Stowing North Carolina Mon-
day attacked the Surgeon
General's report linking
sinoking with various duseas-
€s as raising more questions
than It answered.

“The report raised a lot of
questions, but it didn't find
the answers," Gov. Terry
Sanford told the annual con-
vention of the National Asso-
ciation of Tobacco Distrib-
Ulers at the Fontainebleau
Hotel.

“This report Is by no
means astisfactory to
doctors and sclentists, either
in ite consideration of ques-
tions concerning tobacco usé
or its contribution to the
scientific unierstanding of
the diseases to which it ade
dresges Itself," Sanford sald.

Sanford, governor of the
nation’s chief tubacco-produc-
ing and processing state, said,
“I don't in any way discredit
the report to the Surgeon
General.

“But when I am asked if it
doesn't pin down the condem-
nation to tobacco, once and
for all, my answer Is emphat-
ically, that it does not”

Sanford suggested “two
Constructive courses of ac-
tion.”

Sanford Predicts
New Leaf Gains

MIAMI BEACH, Fla (AP) —
North Carolina Gov. Terry San-
ford made a prediction Monday
of “new levels of growth and
prosperity” for the tobacco in-
dustry “once it is freed from the
clouds of health considerations"
by research into the cause of
cancer and heart disease

Addressing the National As-
sociation of Tobacco Distribu-
tors, Sanford said the gavera-
ment report on smoking “raised
& lot of questions but didn’t find
the answers."

Sanford, gevernor of a state
that produces two-thirds of the
nation’s tohucco, challenged the
basis on which he said “exces-
sively deduated regulators”

were seeking to take tobacco
away {rom ils users,

“What.” he asked, “would
satisfy the ological needs
ef the 70 million Amercans who
smoked in 1963, if they were
suddenly deprived of tobacco?”

Antismoking campaigns of
today, he said. are being waged
“prumarily with statistical cor
relations of one kind or an-
other."

Declaring that the govern:
Ment report “doesn't pin down
the condemnation of tobacco,”
he proposed a continuing study
af tobacco “lo identify anil
eliminate the suspecled health
risks," and a more intensive
Bludy of cancer and heart ail
ments.

Sanford said that since 1900
the annual death rate from ma-
jor luag ailments has fallen by
84 per cent, during a period
which cigarette smoking was on
the merense.

Sarford hit at what he called
fneon-'stencies in the recent re-
port af the U.S. surgeon general
linkirs cigarette smoking and
lune cancer.

“| dn ant in any way discredit
the revert fo the surgeon gen-
ea." said Sanford. “But when
loam asked if it doesnt pin
@ovn hs condemnation of to-
ba‘co, once and for all, my
€ns ver 15, emphatically, that it
does not”

Sanford called attention to
statistical surveys nut used by

the advisory committee and cit-
ed the incadence of tung cancer
in non-smokers.

He predicted the tobacco in-
dusiry would altain new peaks
of prosperity “once il is freed
from the cloud of health consid-
erations by scientific research
and discovery ints ine hase
causes of cancer and ciseares

of the heart and respiratory
systems. rt

Sanford, who smokes an occa-
sonal cigar, comes from a
state which produces most of
the nation's flue-cured tobacco
and manufactures 60 per cent
of its cigarettes,

He said tobacco has been
Plagued by health scares since
Sir Waller Raleigh first import-
ed the leaf to England,

“Each century has had its
Gedicated forces,” he stated,
“who were positive that the
world’s ills could be traced to
totacco and that immortality
and the millenium would some-
how be achieved if tobacco
were abolished.”

Sanford said the surgeon
General's report states that a
casual relationship cannot be
established by statistical meth-
ods, and yet “‘as far as 1 can
determine, the report proceeds
to rely on statistics to arrive at
ils conclusions which condemn
smoking.

“The further fact is that this
report dees not specify any sub-
stance In tobacco smoke that
would account for causing a dis.
ease,” Sanford added. “And
yet how man: people realize
this, among the millions of
Americans to whom the report
was conveyed as an official
finding on the smoking and
health question.

"IT believe that most Ameri.
cans with any horse sensc will
