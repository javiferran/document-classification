WASHINOTON- Passive smoke in the
workpiace might be a much bigger health
danger than U.S. wofkers have been led to
believe, eccortting to a new government
study.

ters for Disease Control, and appear in a

apecial issue of the Journal of the Amerl-
can Medical Assouation on the health
impacts of tobacco. At a news conference
yesterday to publicize the journal's re-
search, AMA officials urged mvestors to
avoid 13stocks and 1,414 mutual funds that
invest in tobaccw manufacturing. The AAfA
shed Its own tobacco holdings In 1986.
The passive-smoke findings represent
themost extensive data ever compiled on
nonsmokers exposure to cigarette smoke
In the U.S. The new information will likely
add ballast to antismoktng grolps' etforts
at the federal, atate asd local levels to ban
smoking in office buitdings and other
publtcplaces. .
According to the stndy, 87.991; of all
nonstmkers in the U.S&amp; have detectable
levels of cotinhte in ttuo;r ffiood. Cottnine is .
a nicotine residue that turns up in the blood
serum af indivlduals exposed to tobacco
smoke. The stu-rey, conducted from 1988 to
1991, involved physical examinations of
12,678 indivtduals nattonwlde.
Nonsmokers Understate Exposure
Of the nonsmokers surveyed. 12.4%
reported they were exposed to tobacco
smoke at work only, compared with 7.7%
who reEtorted they were exposed to Gtbatx;o
smoke at home only; 38,8% reported no
eXpoSUre at all, and 3.1% reported expo•
surp at both home and work.
The JAMAstudyoffers atrong evidencc
that people tend to understate their expo-
sure to passive smoke. There is a wide gap
between nonsmokers who say they are
• exposed to tobacco smoke - 379C of adul ts
and 43% of children - compared with the
87 9°.4 whose cotinine shows they are ex-
posed. This gap is significant because most
previous studies of woffttl3ace passive-
sntoke exposurce, meny of them funded by
the tobacco htdustry, relied on survey data
eather than biood samples. .
D•en though the stody found that more
nonsmokers are exposed to tobacco smoke
at work than at home, the study makes
Clear that the amamt of ni[btine absorbed
into a nonsmoker's bloodstream is likelier
to be higher If one lives with a smoker than
!t one works with one. Nonsmokers ez-
posed to tobaczo athome had roughly twice
as much cot;pine in their blood as non-
,mokers exposed to tobatxo atwork.
The federal tkettgatlonal Health and
Safety Adnnnistratlon has proposed a reg-
ulation that would ban virtually all smok-
ing in the workplace. 13ut the agency has
moved slowly in issuing a final rule - it
isn't expected this year -parCy because
agency officials are combtng through a
mountain of public comments and partly
because of budget cuts. She new findings
were made available to faSHA before its
commentperiod on the smoldngruleended
in mid-Januaty. '
The Bnvimnmenuil Protection Agency
declared passive smoke a caroinogen
nearly four years ago, but their finding has
stirred some controversy fn the scientific
community. A recent report by the Con-
gressional Research Service expressed
such uncertainty on the topic that advo-
cates far and against tobacco both claimed
vindication from it.
8nt Sames Pirkle, the study's lead
author, yesterday said the new findinge
are "much better data than the CB5 report
ever looked at." '
But Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman
forthe Tobacco Institute, said of the JAMA
findin&gt;;s, "It's not a health-effects study."
She said the study focused on niwttne
exposureasmeasured in "molecules," and
that the source ot these trace amouhts
mightbe certain foods, such as tomatoes or
potatoes, or a"momentary whiff" of to-
bar.cn smoke.
