where others can't escape its impact:
In buses, public meeting rooms, ele-
vators, lobbies. In a taxi, it makes
sense to forbid smoking if either the
driver or passenger objects.In the meantime, it's clear that
states such as Louisiana and Nebras-
ka are on the right track in increasing
cigarette taxes and• dsing the pro-
ceeds to finance research and anti-
smoking health programs. '
Dozens of anti-smoking bills are I
before Congress. Of them, the most
logical may be a plan to double the
federal excise tax. It's now 16 cents a
pack. Because of inflation, that's only
15 percent of the price.of a pack of -'
cigarettes, down from 42 percent in
1951.
But why think modestly? How
about a $1-a-pack tax on cigarettes? -
That would certainly discourage
many tecn-agers from starting the :
habit. Admittedly, because smoking ri
is such a blue-collar habit today, it
would be a regressive levy. But it
would Improve public health. And in
the process, net Uncle Sam $20 billion
a year, turning a national addiction
into a national deficit-reduction
program. ,
