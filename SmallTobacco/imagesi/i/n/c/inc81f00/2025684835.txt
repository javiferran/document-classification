L.A. Approves
Strict On-Job
Smoking Law

By TED VOLLMER,
Times Staff Writer.

Ending nearly a month of public
and behind-the- scenes debate, the
Los Angeles City Council voted.12
to 3 Tuesday to adopt a strict
ordinance: requiring employers
throughout: the city to set' aside
no-smoking areas for their work-
ers.

The final vote, in doubt until the
last minute due to heavy. lobbying
by. tobacco: industry representa-
tives, signaled a. major victory for
nonsmokers’ groups;. who cheered!
and spplauded loudly as ithe result
was announced.

The measure, authored iby Coun-
eilman Marvin Braude, now goes to
Mayor Tom Bradley. for. hus signa-
ture or veto. Bradley, has indicated
in the past: that he supports some

‘type of no-smoking: regulations

affecting the workplace.

«~ Tuesday,, however, a. Bradley
‘spokeswoman said that the mayor
-will make: up his mind on the
‘wouncil-passed law “when it

teaches his desk.”

7 "If the mayor. does sign the ordi-
Bence into law, employers would
. Mave 120idays to:enact a no-smok-

steg palicy.

--But.even ifthe mayor does sign
‘the ordinance, there is still a pos-
sibility that the tobacco industry,
which fought. the measure: so
strongly over the past month, may.
peek a referendum: on the: issue.
Last year, the industry spent:about
-$2 million in.an unsuccessful effort
to set aside San Francisco's work-
place no-smoking ordinance. .

Braude predicted last week that
the tobaceo industry would not rol!
ever and accept such a law in the

nation's second largest city. Tues+
day, he in effect: dared them to:
attempt areferendum.

~—Braude told a crowd of
that. the tobacco industry had
spread “myths” about smoking and

the dangers of so-called second:
hand smoke. Braude, who also has
authored city laws agains: smoking
in' elevators and in medical facili-
ties, attributed. the: final council.
vote lo nonsmokers who pressured |
individual members to beef up the
ordinance after it was seriously
weakened two weeks.ago.

“Of course I'm delighted and of
course I'm thrilled that it passed by
12 votes, but the real credit: goes to
the nonsmoking public who voiced
their views on the subject,” Braude
said.

Tobacco industry officials, who
also had expressed their views on
the subject, were vague after Tues-
day's vote about any. future effort:
to kill the ordinance.

when asked if the institute is
considering. a referendum, said, “1
