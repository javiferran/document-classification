By, TEDvoLLMER,
T1mu Sfaf f Writer
Ending nearly a,month of public
and beltind'-the.-scenes debate, the
La Angeles CYty Council voted a2
to 3 Tuesday to adopt a strict
ordinance requiring employers
throughout the city to seti aside ,
no-smoking areas for their work-
era.
The final vote, in doubt until the ',
last minute due to heavy lobbying ,
by tobacco industry representa,
tives. signaled a major vibtory for
nonsmokers' groups, who cheered '
and applauded lbudly as the result
was announced.
The measure; authored Iby Cotm-
cilman Marvin Braude„now goes.to '
May,or Tom Bradley for his signa- ~
ture or veto. Bradley has indicated
in the past' that he supports some t

authored city laws agairut smoking

ties, attributed the final council
vote to nonsmokers who preaswed ~
indiividual members to beef up thee
ordinance after it was seriously
weakened two weeks.ago:
"Of course I'm delighted and of
course I'm thrilled that it passed by
12 votes, butthe real credit'goes to
the nonsmoking,public who voiced
their views on the sutiject;" Braude
said.
Tobacco industry officials, who
also had expressed their views on
the subject, were vague after Tues-
day's vote about any future effort
to kill the ordinance.
Bill AylwardJ assdstant to the
president of the Washington,
D:C:-based Tobacco lnstitute,
when asked if the institute is
considering a referendtun, said. "I

But, he added. "It is reasonably
well known that we are on ~neeord

Greg Fletcher: a spokesman for
the Los Angeles Area Chamber of'
Commerce: meanwhile, said' that
organization has "no intention,
whatsoever" of starting up a refer-
endum petition drive, despiu , itas
strong opposition to a provision ~
making iti a erime,for an employer
to retaliate against employees who.
try to enforce the ordinance.
The ordinance sent to Bradley
requires employers with fi ve or
more employees to,make "reasona-
ble efforts" to accommodate the
desires of nonsmokers for a,
smoke-free working environment.
E:tempted from the law would be.
"those portions of restauranu: barss
or, hotels where food or alcoholic
beverages are servedlto, the pub-
lic:"'
Specifically outlawed iasmoking,
in employee restrooms and medical:
facilities. At least two-thirds of thee
space in employee lunch rooms.
cafeterias and lounges also must be
set asidefornonsmokera.
The most controversial portion
of the heavily amended legisla•
tion-a prohibition on retaliating
against employees who wish to
enforce the ordinance-remaincd
intact despite a heavy push bv ,
