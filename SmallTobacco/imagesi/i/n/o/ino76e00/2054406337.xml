<ot>smokers,
stores deal
with recall
BY CHARLES SLACK
TIMES-DISPATCH STAFF WRITER
For the next few days, Philip Mor-
ris cigarettes may be harder to find
than sissies in Marlboro Country.
Stores in Richmond and around
the country began pulling cartons
from their shelves after Philip Morris
USA on Friday announced a recall of
12 brands and 36 package types. The
recalled cigarettes include Marl-
boros, the company's most popular
brand, which are made in Richmond.
Defective filters in some ciga-
rettes could cause wheezing and diz-
ziness, the company said.
Spokesman David Laufer said the
company doesn't believe any defec-
tive cigarettes have reached stores,
but, "we're casting a pretty wide

net."
, The unusual recall of up to 8 billion
cigarettes could cost about $200 mil-
lion, the company estimated. It said
the affected brands should be avail-
able again within several days.
'~ Laufer said it was impossible to
,know which, if any, cigarettes made
-at the company's South Richmond
,plant contained the defective filters.
,The filters were supplied by a New
Jersey company, Hoechst Celanese.
° ~nThe company said "a small per-
;~.-e centage" of filters were found to con-
4ain' a material that could cause
'smokers "temporary discomfort"
;ranging from a bad taste and eye,
4iose and throat irritation to dizzi-
'ness, coughing or wheezing.
k r~ In Richmond yesterday afternoon,
;several large chain retailers already
had pulled cigarettes on the recall
'list. But some smaller stores said
PLEASE SEE RECALL, PAGE A25 /
I Laufer said some retailers might
'not have received Mailgrams an-
nouncing the recall. But he urged all
stores to pull the affected brands and
he urged customers to return ciga-
rettes that are on the list.
The company is dispatching thou-
sands of sales representatives to vis-
it all 370,000 retailers nationwide
-that sell Philip Morris cigarettes dur-
ing the next few days. The sales reps
will examine code numbers on the
pulled cartons and decide whether
they can be returned to the shelves.
• ~ Some Richmond-area retailers
'said smokers were concerned and
; were switching to other brands tem-
porarily.
, "'They're trading for Winston and
Salem," said Kyung Chung, owner of
Boulevard Market in the Fan Dis-
trict. "They don't want to smoke the
Philip Morris Cos. product right
now."
.they were unaware of the problem or
=hadn't received official notification.

'But Ej. Mullins, owner of Morris
: Super Market near Ashland, said, "I
^,have not had anyone bring a pack in
all day" for a refund. In fact, - one
woman who had bought Camel
Lights at a nearby store that had
stopped selling Marlboros asked
Mullins to swap for her preferred
brand. He obliged.
Mullins, a retired Philip Morris
mechanic who smokes the compa-
ny's cigarettes, said he thinks Philip
Morris is recalling the brands "just to
be-on'ithe safe side." .
"They'll spend thousands of dol-
lars to get back a pack that looks
,bad," he said.
Like several other proprietors of
non-chain stores contacted yester-
day, Mullins said that as of yesterday
evening he hadn't pulled any brands
from his shelves because he hadn't
gotten word to do so.
Don Lewis, assistant manager of
Stonewall Market on Grove Avenue,
said, "We've received no kind of offi-
cial notice," and added that;the com-
pany hadn't pulled any cigarettes.
"I'm smoking Marlboros' right
now," Lewis said. Customers, were
"aware but not alarmed" by news of
the recall, he said.
Some other retailers were pulling
only cartons with certain code num-
bers.
Angela Edwards, a clerk at Patter-
son Express in the Fan, said that, on
the advice of its supplier, the store
was removing cartons with code
numbers beginning with "55."
"We've pulled a few cartons," Ed-
wards said. "It hasn't hit us too
hard."
