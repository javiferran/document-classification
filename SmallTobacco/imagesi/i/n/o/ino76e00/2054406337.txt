For the next few days, Philip Mor-
ris cigarettes may be harder to find
than sissies in Marlboro Country.

Stores in Richmond and around
the country began pulling cartons
from their shelves after Philip Morris
USA on Friday announced a recall of
12 brands and 36 package types. The
recalled cigarettes include Marl-
boros, the company’s most popular
brand, which are made in Richmond.

Defective filters in some ciga-
rettes could cause wheezing and diz-
ziness, the company said.

Spokesman David Laufer said the
company doesn’t believe any defec-
tive cigarettes have reached stores,
but, “we’re casting a pretty wide

- + The unusual recall of up to 8 billion
cigarettes could cost about $200 mil-
lion, the company estimated. It said
the affected brands should be avail-
able again within several days.

: Laufer said it was impossible to
know which, if any, cigarettes made
‘at the company’s South Richmond
‘plant contained the defective filters.
‘The filters were supplied by a New
Jersey company, Hoechst Celanese.

' UThe company said “a small per-
icentage” of filters were found to con-
tain * a : material that could cause
‘smokers “temporary discomfort”
stanging from a bad taste and eye,
mose and throat irritation to dizzi-
coughing or wheezing.

- Several large chain retailers already
‘ had pulled cigarettes on the recall

‘list. But some smaller stores said
they were unaware of the problem or
shadn’t received official notification.

«4 Laufer said some ' retailers might
‘not have received Mailgrams an-
nouncing the recall. But he urged all
stores to pull the affected brands and
he urged customers to return ciga-
rettes that are on the list.

‘ The company is dispatching thou-
sands of sales representatives to vis-
it all 370,000 retailers nationwide
‘that sell Philip Morris cigarettes dur-
ing the next few days. The sales reps

will examine code numbers on the

pulled cartons and decide whether

they can be returned to the shelves.
»: Some Richmond-area retailers
‘said smokers were concerned and
“were switching to other brands tem-
- porarily.
.' “They’re trading for Winston and
: Salem,” said Kyung Chung, owner of
‘Boulevard Market in the Fan Dis-
- trict. “They don’t want to smoke the
Philip Morris Cos. product right
“now.”

. But EJ. Mullins, owner of Morris
-Super Market near Ashland, said, “I
“have not had anyone bring a pack in
all day” for a refund. In fact, one
woman who-had bought Camel
Lights at a nearby store that had
stopped selling Marlboros asked
Mullins to swap for her preferred
brand. He obliged.

Mullins, a retired Philip Morris
mechanic who smokes the compa-
ny’s cigarettes, said he thinks Philip

Morris is recalling the brands “just to
be-on the safe side.”

“They'll spend thousands of dol-
lars to get back a pack that looks
_bad,” he said.
~~ Like several other proprietors of
non-chain stores contacted yester-
day, Mullins said that as of yesterday
evening he hadn’t pulled any brands
from his shelves because he hadn’t
gotten word to do so.
