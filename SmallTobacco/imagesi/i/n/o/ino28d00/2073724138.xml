A formsr associate of an organized-crima
family told Senate investigators yesterday
that the Mafia has infdtrafed bingo'opera-'
tions on 12 of the 90 Indian reservations
that run large-scale games to raise money.
The witness, identified as "Marty,", was
---concealed.bya.screen-whenfietestified:--He-
d"sputed evidence given by a senior Federal
Sureau' of Investigation official who said
that organized crime jias yet to become "a
substantial and consistent threat" on the
nation's reservations.
"I'm not saying that the FBI is wrong,"
the witness told the investigations subcom-
mittee of the Senate Select Committee on
Indian A f i a i m . - " • C h e y are not getting cor-
rect information."' I- • I -
.__The witness told of running a large bingo
hall on a reservation in the West where he
estimated "the family" kept $600,000 to
$700,000~a year in profits that belonged to
the tribe.
Speaking through a system that electron-
ically altered his voice, the witness said that
at least-threerorganized-crime families ac-
tive in Indian bingo-the Luchese, Buffalino
_. and.Meyer-Lansky_famiHes-used manage-_._-_.
_ment fronts and a variety of schemes to__ _
divert'money from Indians. Games would be
-
rigged, money taken from house receipts,
= and tribal leaders paid-off, he said.
At the-ieservation where he worked, the
witness said he paid the tribal chief $1,000
a week "as a consultant," hired all of the
chief's relatives at the bingo hall and bought
supplies from mob-connected enterprises.
He said his salary was $2,500 a week.
The witness said that organized-crime
figures controlled the bingo games run by
an Indian tribe in Lawton, Okla., and a game
controlled by the Cabazon band of Mission
Indians in Riverside County, Calif.
"There are instances of La Cosa Nostra-
connected gambling operations, primarily
bingo games, on some Indian reservations,"
said Anthony E. Daniels, deputy assistant
director of the FBI's criminal investigative
division. "Our experience shows that alle-
gations of La Cosa. Nostra involvement
sometimes exceeds the actual fact." 4
