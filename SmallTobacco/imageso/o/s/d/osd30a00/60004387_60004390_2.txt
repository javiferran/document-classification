The Spraque-Dawley rats (one in the treatment group died)
were sacrificed on Day 14 following their last injection. An
overdose of ether anesthesia was sued for sacrifice. Samples
were then taken, immediately frozen with driy ice and acetone and
kept in a freezer at -100°C, Testosterone determinations on:
plasma were performed by the radicimmunoassay method of Castro
et. al, (1973, 1974).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The results of the analyses are shown in Tables I and II.
No significant changes in testosterone concentrations were
observed between the control and treated groups.

Since heparin and ascorbic acid are mutually inhibitory in
several biological systems including blood coagulation, development
of osteoporosis and steroid synthesis, it seom reascnable to expect
a similar antagonism in other ascorbate-dependent metabolic systens,
No inhibition of testosterone synthesis was apparent in our

systems, however, :
