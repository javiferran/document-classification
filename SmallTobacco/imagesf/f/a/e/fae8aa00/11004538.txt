Re: Meeting on the Future Use of Swedish and
American Twin Registers for Research on
Smoking and Health. December 1 - 4, 19869

Dear DOr. Hockett:

In my letter of July 15 I stated that the place
for the meeting would be the Virgin Isle Hilton
on St. Thomas. However, I have now been informed
by the Hiller Travel Service that this hotel
will not be able to receive our group, due ta
other previously accepted arrangements. The
travel agency instead suggest the Americana Hotel
of San Juan on Puerta Riso. As far as I can see
this place is in all respects comparable to

the Virgin Isie Hilton and I hope that this
change of sites in no way will be inconvenient
to you.

Yours sincerely,

Lars Friberg, M.D.

P.S.

I have got a letter from Or. J. Cornfield, where

he suggests that we invite Or. Manning Feinleib

of the National Heart Institute. He is engaged in

a detailed examination in Framingham of several
hundreds of the VA pairs. I think this is a good
idea and have sent him a letter of invitation.

We believe it is possible to include Dr. Feinleib
in the group because of the fact that Mr. Enslein
is not among the invited participants but is taking
part as an observer from the Tobacco Research Council.
