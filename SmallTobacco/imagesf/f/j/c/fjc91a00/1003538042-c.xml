OK for Patients to Smoke and' Drinlr
Telling a patient he must
give up smoking or drinking
can sometimes do ~ -him more
- harm than, gpod. This ~ is the
opinion of Dr. Chauncey D.
f:eake, professor of pharma}
cology at Ohio State iUniiver-
sity and president of, the So-
cie,ty for Experimental Biology5
and Medicine.
Dr. Leake set. forth his views I
in an address before the Delaware Academy of'
Goeral Practice in. Wilmington. .
. Such doctor-imposed rules can be particu-
larly detrimenjallin the case of'elderly patients,
he said.
"The doctor who arbitrarily deprivess a pa-
tient of minor pleasures inevitably diminishes
the patient's will to recover,"' he said. "Some-
times patients wonder whether a sharply re-d stricted lifle is worth the effort."
Recovery from illness, especially among the '
elderlc, he continued, dlzpends in large part'
upon faith and hope-faith in the physician
and hope for improvement.
"If the patient can learn to avoid' inhaling-
and nobody should ever inhale twbaceo smoke
whether he is sick or well--almost anyone can
smoke without harm," he said. "I don't think
that's too high a price t6 pay for whatever sol-
ace smoking, offers."
Dr. Leake described, alcohol as a drug with
a long a'nd' distinguished history in the practice
of medicine, noting that wine has been used,
over the centuries as the first tranquilizer, an
efficient sedative, and, the earliest known apes-
thetiie. ,
"Alcoholic drinks may be used to advantage:
in many chronic ailments," he continued. "They
may be helpful in promoting appetite, and
may aid in convalescence from disease or sur-,
gical operations. They may be comforting, in
old age when there are so many physical in-
firmities and solfew satisfactions.
. -
'Beverages containing' alcohol are pleasant'-
ly, and civilizingly relaxing, in chronic anxiety
and stress patters, and they can help in pre-
venting cardiovascular accidents or overloads.
Ini.many ways alcoholic drinks may be used for
worthy medicall purposes, both for mental and
physical health."
He points out, however, that internal mem-
branes may be irritated by drinks containing
more than 20% alcohol. IIe frowns on dtinking
straight distilled liquors as an insult to one's
stmmach: They should be diluted.
'
Among the ailing, he said, some il2nesses ca111
for a single highball or cocktail while ot'herss
are better managed if the alcohol is taken in
more dilute form as in beer or wine.

Both R'utgers University and
neighboring Setoni Hal'1' College
of' Medicine have reported pro-
ducing a high rate of cancers
in animals by injecting them
first with non-tumor viruses
commonly carried by humans
and then applying doses of'
known cancer-producing agents
or conditions.
. s r
Clearly suggested in these
experiments is the possibility
that any virus might touch off
cancer growth under the ri&gt;aht'
circumst'ances-and; hopefully,
immunization might halt it.
Additional evidence was re-
ported by the University of

But if' controlled laboratory

1961, nature was as inexplicable
as ever.

C
LOCAL NEWSCASTER INTRODUCTIqN: In Chicago to address the Illinois
Academy of'General Practice, Dr. Clarence Cook Littl'e, of Bar Harbor,
Maine, famed cancer researcher and geneticist, talked on two subjects of
general interest.
INTERVIEWER: Dr. I.i:ttle, as a world-renowned geneticist, could

been harmed by fallout radiation?
to come.
°" -'DR. LIT'ILE: Yes, it i&amp;possible Geneticists know that any
irradiation, gamma i:rradiatiom, which reaches the germ cell i's a1potential
danger and may change that germ cell and its descendents for all time
INTERVIEWER: I see, Dr. Little, in Chicago we lately have been
recording intensities of aroundione picocurie fallout. Would an intensity
of that little amount still likely produce mutations?
DR'. LITTLE: Yes, it could, there's probably a range that we
don't yet know, because naturally you don't experiment with people.
There's probably a range whichiproduces the greatest number of'mutations.
But if that would be within that range or not no one knows. I would
say, however, that it is a danger.
INTER`7IEtJ,ER : Doctor, onianother subject. Because of your great
interest and work in this field, I would like to ask, Doctor, has it
ever been definitely establishediwhether smoking does or does not cause
cancer?
DR. LITTLE: In my opinion,,no. Smoking is still suspect. The
statisticse are significant enough and suggestive enoughito make it
imperative that research be carried out on the experimental level to
find this question out, and this is being done. It is going to be done
until we know whether smoking does anything, and, if so,, what the other
causes may be and exactly what it does. Right now, all you can say is
we doni't know but we're going,to find out.
IBITEHVIEWER: And may I'take your lighted pipe here as an added
comment in that same direction?

What An Ececutive Should Know About His Health, by Dr. Charles Tho:apson,
The Dartnell Coaporation, Chicago.
In a chapter called "The Tobacco Problem," the author reviews the pros and
_ -' cons of tobacco and health. He notes that science has not found the answers
to tobaceo's reported!role in lung,cancer, which he calls "one of the great
scienti'fic pazzles 'of our. day."' He closes the chapteriwith these comments:
"The indisputable fact is that people like to smoke; and until there's
convincing laboratory proof'that smoking is dangerous, they are going to
continue to smoke, whether statistics say it is a detriment to health or
`not. There are, in fact, many people who would even smoke the paper the
statistics are printed upon.
whole that moderate smoking hurts the normally healthy person.
"There is so far not enough evidence to convince medical scientists as aa
and'ulcers of the digestive tract."
"However, doctors agree that smoking is not advisable -with acute or chronic
respiratory troubles, and many physicians consider smoking unwise in cases
of obesity, heart troubles, thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease),.
Dr. Thompson heads an association of doctors specializing in the field of
executive health evaluation. He also~is on the staff of Northwestern

in view of this campaign, it is little wonder that so many youngsters 4='
smoke. We must change this picture. We have an, obligation tn our W

cigarets because this approach
failed in the case of alcohol. But
another speaker at the meeting,
Dr. Richard H. Overholt, profes-
sor at' the I Tufts Medical College
in Boston, proppsedlthat cigaret
vending machines be banned be-
cause they made it.possible forr
youngsters to purcFiase cigarets.
Overholt .said that' cigaret sell-
ers should be licensed as are li-
Iquor stores. He said'tobacco also
should be, made subject to- the
Pure Food and Drug Act, so the
government would have control
of advertising and of shipments.
Tobacco-industry spokesmen reactedl quietly and philosophically
last week; to a much-publicized panel of the District of' Columbia Medical
Society on the alleged perils of smoking. The panel'a'st's had agreed unan-
imously that patients should be warned of statistical and' cli,n2ieall findings
that link cigarette smoking to lung cancer. The dbctors on the panel,
including a cancer specialist, are all former smokers.
,.:.
Significantly, none of the panelists favored legislation to back
their reconmendations,, not even, legislation to curb vending-machine
sales of cigarettes (to keep minors from buying'tobaceo'products illegal-
ly). The Tobacco Institute, which represents the industry in the national
capital, declined to have a representative at the' session.

.I'.ead paragraPh'of the Journal story says, "An education program to dis-
courage teenagers Y2+om taking up smoking was urged by the American Medical
;iAssoci,ation and the National Education Associ'ation." t

The article reports on one resolution passed by The Joint Commit'tee on
Healt'h Problems in Education, composed of representatives of the two
associat'ions. The news stories were based on a news release from, the A.M.A.

that reported this resoluti'on as well as eight others by the Joint Committee.

The others dealt with such subjects as automobile seat belts, use of food
' consisting "essentially of sugar," dangers of "rebound tumbling equipment,'".
; and athletic programs for girls.





The Joint Committee's reson lution on smoking` is, in ilil.''1: "It is now agpareat
iromlobservations and studies that the'individual can best avoid the practice'
f of smoking,by never formffng,the habit. In view of'aceumu_lat'ing,evidence sug-

gesting deleterious health effects from smmking,and no evidence of any bene-
;;,ficial effects,,the Joint Committee encourages the home and school to'initl'ate
education for prevention at:the ages prior to the usual beginning of the

practice. Such education should take the form of thorough esploration of the
socialifactors imvolved and conflicting views relating to,the effects of
smoking on p3yysicaL and emotional health6"

Quoting an A.M.A. oPficial the Wall Street Journal said "the statement was
~--nade primarily in support of including smoking education in school health and

hygiene classes,"'aiming at 10-12 year-olds. The official saidithe state-
a ment wouLd'be published im, the assoniat'ions' publicat3ons






The Journal story noted that "Medical researchers have suggested in recent

years that cigaret smoking may be a cause of lung cancer and that smoking may

effect the heart and bloodivessels. These theories, though, are controversial,"





(Note: An A.M~A. official, in private conversation, said,the'JointCommittee's
,resolution was in line vith,past actions of the A.M.A. in support of health
education in"aChoOls.
Miinutes of`the Joint Committee meeting indicate no diseussion of the smoking

at one point raised the general question of whether a resoiution should be

U.S. Is Sfill' Smoking From a Great' Colonial Love.
By WARD CANNEL
Newspaper Enterprise Assn.
NEW YORK - (NEA) -
Ah, romance. It is ex-
actly 350 years since an
Englishman n a rn e d J o h n
Rolfe wooedi and won a lo&lt;
cal girl f~rom
Jamestown~ Va.,
named Poca
hontals-and
started a fire
around the
world t' h a t is
still smoking
furiously today.
For with the
nuptials barely
finished, Rolfe
wife's
took his
Cannel
dowry and hur-
ried down to the town wharf
to pay off a bribe.
For a priice; a Dutchi sea cap-
tain had smuggled' a handful
of tobacco seed out' of Spanish-
heldl Santo, Domingo for Rolfe.
And within the year of'1612, the
first commercial crop was har-
vested and exported, putting
Virginia on a paying, basis.
: . :
Now, tobacco had b e e n
around Europe ever since one
of Coiumbus'sailorsnamed
Jerez had picked up the smok-
inghabiit in theBahama&amp; in
14'92. But, generaldy„ it was
only sailors on the Atlantic run
who used tobacco for the next
century.
Little by little, the fashion
spread: But once the James-
towni crop proved successful~
tobacco hit the world like a
hula hoop.
In England, clay pipes were
to be seen everywhere. In
Rome, a, pope called on one
of his cardinals for instruction
in smoking. In Africa, natives
traded land, cattlle„ and even
their fellow tribesmen for to.
bacco.
. . .
Historian Jerome B r o o k s
notes that, during, the Great
Plague of 11664, school children
POCOHONTAS: Need we say
more?
were given a daily medicinal
pipe. Queen Caroline's court
in England used tobacco as a
dentifrice. In the Orient, opium
users began to smoke their
narcotics for the first time-
mixed, of course, with tobacco
from America.
In every civilized capital in
the world, professors "in the
art of whiffing'' gave expensive
series of lectures, according to
one chronicle.
And if smoking were that
profitable, Yankee ingenuity
calculated~ tobacco must' have
many more uses. Consequently, snuff was born and happily ac-
cepted' by citizens of' a Europe
redolent with outdoor plumb-
ing' and' no sewage disposal
systems.
By and by, according to one
-hist~ory, "The Mighty Leaf" wass
being used as an "unguent, aa
gargle, an emetic, a cathartic,
and a remedy for coughs, colds,
sores, headaches, gangrene and.
paralysis:"'
. . .
And with demand gro.wing'
daily, it' was not surprising that
tobacco was soon being used
as money in the colonies.
A clergyman was paid 16,000
pound's of tobacco per year. A
funeral cost 400 pounds, a wedL
ding 200 pounds, the trans-
atlantic passage for a bridie
from England 120 pounds.
In 16'S3, the Virginia Assem-
bly tried to get money back in
use. But it didn't work and
nine years later tobacco was
made legal tender, acceptable,
in payment of taxes.
A century and a half later,,
it still was being used' as legali
tender-part of soldiers' pay,
an exchange for help from
France during the Revolution-
ary war, accept'able donationi to.
Gen. Washington's war fund.
: s r
Meanwhile, John Rolfe's cropp
hadl spread widely throughout'
the Southern colonies, making
fortunes for many planters„lur-
ing new and needed, settlers
from Europe, forcing, a young
country to build a merchant'
marine fleet that would be vi.
tally needed in the coming,fight'
against England.
Curiously, too, the vast lands
needed for tobacco growing re-
sulted in the development of'f
representative government. The
planters could not make the
long trip to town meetings as
farmers in New Englandl could!
And today, withi Americans
buying 477 billion cigars and
cigarettes an nual2y,, and 170
million pounds of smnkino and
chewing tobacco and snuff,
Rolfe's marriage to Pocohontas
still is being lived happily everr
after.
And while tobacco won't pay

"Anyone is vulnerable to emphysema. Whatever the causative

The Tobacco Auctioneer
Has a Song All His Own
We couldl never understand the mumblings of to-
bacco auctioneers; in fact„ we make iit' a: point to stay
away f'romi any auction area for fear that possiblly .
scratching, our chin might cost us money.
We always thought that tobacco auctioneers de-
liberately try to confuse, but since coming across an
article in the Tobacco News, published! by the Tobacco
Institute, Inc., that opinion has changed.
Joe Bouldin, a tobacco, auctioneer, said: ""A lot of
people think the auctioneer tries to confuse. That's
not so at all. I try to make it as plain as possible. The
chant is an attempt to set a pace you can hold, to get
a rhythm so you, get your buyers walkiing, and biddiing
in that rhythm. Them your sale goes faster and much
more smoothly."
In other words, it's like music, huh, Joe?'
"It"s easier to work in a chant than to shout,"'.1oe
said. "We have to go sometimes five and! a half hours
.a day. Also a chant helps keep your sale moving. VNe
normally try to se11400 piles an hour and that's a lot."
We agree that shouting is not nearly so appealing
as chanting, and wish that rock 'n" rolll singers would
borrow a 1eaffrom the, tlobacep; auctioneer's book. (IGet!
that-leaf?) That would' be nice-a chanting, rock''n'
roll singor;, as difficult to understand now as before.

The Tobacco Auctioneer

ROBERT McCORMICK: ""A7nong the many periodicals that come throughithe NBC
News Room is the 'Tobacco News,' published quarterly by the Tobacco
-rnstitute. The latest issue touches upon tobacco auctioneers, those
masters of ineZody whose strange chants have defied translations by
outs3ders, but whose weird sing-song laments seem to be understood
perfectly by those skilled in the language. The 'Tobacco_.News'
describes a tobacco sale, at which the bidding begins af~$'69 for
100 pounds. Sixty-nine, as expressed by the auctioneer is fdirly
reasonable. It comes out something like this: 'suh-ixty, nine-nine-
nine-nine-nine-nine." But the first bid from the floor raises the
price to $70, and'seventy turns out to be, 'Alung, semi-emmi-emmi.'
Seventy-one translates into 'Wanna, wanna, wanna, wan,' and seventy-
two and seventy-three are 'semi-do-do-dobtle-tootle-ootle,'' and a
'ree-ree-eee-eee-eee.' I may have lef't out a dootle, or a tootle,
or a ree, or even an eee, but I think I've got it approximately
s.trai g1zt.
"But when the bidding,gets to $75 for 100 pounds, the going gets a
little rougher. Here the auctioneer is ;represented as saying, 'Auna-
fi-i-i-ivy-i." When this part3cular pile of tobacco is sold at that
point, the story ends there, but 'Tobacco News' goes on to say that
the 1961 crop of flue-cured tobacco, described as the major ingredientt
of cigarettes,is bringirg record prices averaging $60 to $65 a hundred
pounds. Tobacco growers will be paid more than a billion dollars by
the time the season is over.
"The auctioneer described in the story, by the way, is Joe Bouldin
--
he's a lawyer, was a county judgE, but he says I'jiust couldn't keep
out of tobacco. He says auctioneers practice by chanting to pine
stumps and telephone poles. The chanting method, he goes on, serves
many purposes. An auctioneer tries to sell 400 piles of tobacco leaves
an hour, which means the buyers have to be kept moving and bidding. The
chant sets a rh,ythm for them, and they sort of (ball the jack?) through
the tobacco sheds, se~ldombrealting the rhythm,, and thus slowin&amp;doran~ the sales procedure.
"Also says BoiLldin, the chant is easier onithe auctioneer than shouting
wouldibe, and sometimes the auctioneer keeps waili'ng away for five andi
a half hours at a time. So anything that saves wear and tear on the
larynx is welcome.
""Tobacco News' also points out by the way, that state taxes on cigarettes
.
now average out to jiust about five cents a pack, while the federal tax
adds another eight cents to each pack -- that makes a total of 13 cents,
. and that doesn't count the local taxes that are imposed i'n many coamnunities
and counties. So it's small wonder than, that the auctioneer sometimes&amp;
sounds so mournful."

-confirms it. Health officials of many nations ~
recognize rthis, and issue warning; to theirdtizens.
The American Cancer Society's official stand is
that it has aresponsibilitytodhe medical profession

judgment, the evidence presented by the many, •
studies reported in recent years indicates beyond
reasonable doutil'that aQarettesmoking is the~
majanause of the unprecedented linaease in lungg
cancer. The Board believes that all organizations
and agencies concerned with cancer have a
responsibility to formulate programs of action
based on this information in order to reduce the
incidence of this larggly preventable disease...
To that end„the Society plans to continue supportt
of research on lung,cancer and to promote the
widespread dissemination of information regarding
causes and prevention of the disease to physicians
and'to the public with primary initial emphasis on
teen-agers:"'
The Society's Teen-Age Program on iCigarettes
and Lung Cancer implements this policy in the
most vigorous way: Although the program has
been in operationior only oneiull school year, the
key educational item, adilmstrip titled To Smoke

throughACS Divisions and Units tb neariy two-

Once upon a time, there was a Virginia colonist named John Rolfe, who married
an Indian princess named Pocahontals and went down in history as one of our
leading' ancestors. The trouble is, nobody seems to know mulch about what John
Rolfe looked like, or what manner of man he was. Now , the Jannesto!uvn
Foundation of the Commonweal'th, of Virginia, has offered a five hundred dol'lar
research avrardi for the best historical information about Rolfe -- hils appearance
and his mannerisms. And why the interest in John Rolfe? Well, back in 1612'
when the colony of Jamestowniwas on the brink of economic collapse, Itolfe'
planted and' harvested the first commercially successful crop of'tobacco in this
country. Hie shipped it to England, where it was very popular and the Jamestown
colony was~ saved. This marked the beginning of commerce and industry in the'
Uni'ted States. Well, the nation will celebrate the 350th anniversary of the
tobacco industry i!n, the United States next year. And what's a cel'ebration with a

Doctors Discuss Air Pollution and Stnoking as Possible Lung Cancer Factors
Moderator: Howard Reig,
Panelists: Dr. Chester Southam,, immunologist, and Dr. Emerson Day, both of..
Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital, and Dr. Herbert Volk, surgeon,
Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
During a discussion of "Cancer,"' Dr. Day answered a question about smoking
and lung cancer with~the following comments:.
DR. DAY: "'....Certai'nly not all smokers get cancer by any means, and many
enjoy the habit without paying any penalty,, and it would be a mistake
to categorically say that smoking is badifor you. II think there is a
place for a moderate use of the product. But certainly the heavy smoker,
particularly of cigarettes -- and we're talking now about the two-pack-al-
day smoker who starts in his teens and is now in his forties and'fifties --
has a measurable and very significantly higher likelihood or risk of having
lung cancer.
"There is much research going,forward to try to get into more explanation
of the details of the mechanism of this. It may be that other factors
are necessary, that it may not be simply smoking of cigarettes, but the
research at Sloan-Kettering Institute and in many other centers -- theree
are many, some two dozen~or more studies -- all would support the state-
ment that in the.absence of excessive cigarette smoking,we would greatly
reduce the number of individuals having th2se quite tragic disease....
"'We are monducting,researchin an attempt to find the basic factors
that go into this hazard, with the idea that there can be developed al
safer smoking product, and I would like to~say...that in this work
certain parts of the tobacco industry have been very helpfi,il, and I
think it''s only fgir to say that we all are going forward in this
study and it is not proper just to damn tobacco and cigarette smoking that there is a hazard, a measurable one, a significant one, but there~
are answers that may be brought forward.
"'In the meantime I think it's essential that we try to practice moderation
in this habit. The moderate exposure to this product I don't think is a--
is a greatly-to-be-deprecated experience.
"....There's a place for moderate use of this product,,certainly."

Scientists Linking. Scattei-ed G'ancer pota
Into~-Singl.e Concept ' of Cause of Disease- -
.¢
By a WALL ~.StREF.T Joi'R\A'T-8hti,(f ~ RCporler
NEW YOBtK-Medicali researchers are
piecing together what they, believe to be a
single explanation of how cancer might be
',caused by anything, from cigaret smoke to
I'viruses. `' -
A wide variety otonce-unrelatcd research
efforts are pinning down the underlying cause
of cancer as being an error committed by
the mechanism in cells that determine
heredity. This error, it is now believed, can be
the result ot damage to the heredity mech-
anismi by suchi- "external agents"' as radia~
tion„ chemicals or viruses„ according to a re-
port publi'shedl today by the Sloan-Kettering
Institute for Cancer Research here..
This emerging "unifying concept" of the
cause of cancer, according, to Dr. Frank L.
HorsfalL Jr., institute director, is giving sci-
entists a, new' "theoretical framework within
wbich to approach in, an orderly way, with
newo tools and talents, the problems of, the
.causes of cancer in man."'
The more scientists know about the causes
of cancer, of course, the better their chances
-r.f learning how to prevent it or cure it_. For
instance, if it is found that viruses cause some
kinds of human cancer; as scientists strongly
suspeet, it opens the, possibility of immunizing
against the disease with a vaccine, just as
people are immunized against, polio viruses
with vaccines..
In the report, which summarizes the past
two years of research at the institute, Dr.
Horsfail outlines what may be the answer to
a problem that has bothered cancer research-
ers for years: That there seems to be a numr ber of different, seemingly unrelated causes of
cancer.
Cancer ocurs when cells become ab+
normally large andibegin to rapidly reproduce
abnormail cells. These cancerous cells crowd
and starve, surrounding normal, cells and
then take over vital organs through the rest of
the,body.
Why this suddenly happens has been a
mystery. Researchers do know that heavy ex-
posure to X•rays can lead to Leukemia, cam+
cer of the blood. Years df exposure to sunlight
can lead to skin cancer in many people, and
exposure to many chemicals cam also produce
Lhe disease.
Scientists investigating these causes of can+
cer, Dr. Horsfalli says;, are now converging on
a'"common denominator." This demoniator iti,
a substance calledi deoxyribonucleic acidL or
DNA' for short, a, complex chemical found in
the nticleus of all living cells. It is the sub-
stance out of which every cell's heredity-de-
termining chromosomes are madp. It's now
believed that the way the complex molecules
of DNA are arranged Is a"code" that de-
termines the inherited characteristics of' all,
future generations of cells,
"Cancer would appear, by formal defini-
tioni to correspond to a mutation-that is; a
permament hereditary change at' the cell
level," Dr. Horsfall says. Mutations, he ex-
plains, are thought to be the result of changes
in the arrangement of the DNA molecule," a,
typographieal, error in the biological' informa-
tion code."'
. "Such mi can be caased presumably
by rare accidents during cellular reproduction,
by exposure to X-ray or ultraviolet or by a,
number of chemical compounds,'" he says.
There is growing evldence that these genetic
errors•can also•be caused by viruses. In other
words, the agents thought to cause mutations
are the same ones thought to cause cancer. Increasing evidence, coming from geneti-
cists, virologists, biochemists and' a host off
oiher research areas, "leads inevitably to the
concept that cancer, no matter what,the induc-
ing agent, is ultimately the result of an internal
change in chromosomal: nucleic aeid, (DNA) of
the affected cells,"' Dr. HorsfaQl, states.
An example of such evidence;, according to
the report, is new findings on how viruses
might cause cancer:
'Viruses are sub-microscopic bits of matter
made of'an"overcoat" of protein and a"core"
of nucleic acid, either DNA or a sister chemi-
cal called RNA. Working with a virus know
to cause cancer in mice and hamsters„ Sloan-
Kettering, scientists have learned how to ex-
tract the DNA core from the virus. They'vee
found thatthis DIi7A core alone can cause can-
cer in the laboratory animals. The virus DNA;
they found, goes to the nucleus oi' the, ce111
where it apparently does its cancer-causing,
work. Among other things, this has given the
researchers an idea that chemicals might bee
used to interfere with this virus and stop it
from entering, the cell or from causing the
diseAse.

AND THE
SMOKING
PROBLEM
Ak aresult of ~ACS ertorts forseYeral years,;
more and lmore Americans are seriously
facing;the question...."To Smoke or
Not to Smoke?" About half of the aduftt
population has answered by not smoking.
Yeticonsumption of cigarettes has climbed
steadily since World War Iland is still l
rising:
The question is usually faced seriously,
for the fiirst time during teen-age years.
But!regular smokers%face it again and
again. Surveys show that about one-fourth
of the do¢tors who were cigarette smokers
five years.ago have given it up.
Parents must make their own decision i
about smoking, but'they can help
influence teen-agers-our investment and l
hope for the future. A 1959 study of'
Massachusetts physicians showed 93 per
cent agreed thatteen-aggrs should bee
warned about cigarette smoking: Most of'
theothers agreed with the aim of such a i
warning, only, questioned its effectiveness.
Epidemiological research shows lung,
cancer death rate 10 times higher, among
regular smokers as among those who
never smoked. Laboratory research
(experimental, chemical, pathological)
shows atdeast 10 cancer-inducing
substances found lin tobacco smoke. Tars
caused cancer when applied to skin ~of'
mice. Autopsies show significant changgs
in human lung tissue.
WhatV parents stop smoking? The
Society's:study of 22,000 teen-aggrs
showed lit's a big,h'elp because youngsters
are inclined to do.whaftheir parents do
rather than what they say. For parents itt
is doubly wise to stop smoking. Those who
once smoked a pack or more a day but
who had given up smoking for at leasl
one year, hadla dealh rate lessthan half
of those who continued to smoke;.

Lung cancer kills uere men than any
other kind of cancer and shows a taster,
death rate rise tharl for any other
noninfectious disease. Lung cancer claims
the lives of more men yearly than are
killed in automobiksaidents.
The kind of smoking is important. Annual I
lung cancer death rates are 10 times as
high among regular smokers as among,
those who never: smoked. Among cigar
and pipe smokers the rate'is much lower
than among cigarette smokers.
The amount of'smoking, is very, iimportant
A half-pack smokertuns eight times the

per day means 20 times the risk: Depth

ANYBODY SEEN JOHN R'OLFE?-----------------------'----------'_ (I'3'S)'
Once upon a time, there was a Virginia colonist named John Rolfe, who married
an Indian princess named Pocahontals and went down in history as one of our
leading' ancestors. The trouble is, nobody seems to know mulch about what John
Rolfe looked like, or what manner of man he was. Now , the Jannesto!uvn
Foundation of the Commonweal'th, of Virginia, has offered a five hundred dol'lar
research avrardi for the best historical information about Rolfe -- hils appearance
and his mannerisms. And why the interest in John Rolfe? Well, back in 1612'
when the colony of Jamestowniwas on the brink of economic collapse, Itolfe'
planted and' harvested the first commercially successful crop of'tobacco in this
country. Hie shipped it to England, where it was very popular and the Jamestown
colony was~ saved. This marked the beginning of commerce and industry in the'
Uni'ted States. Well, the nation will celebrate the 350th anniversary of the
tobacco industry i!n, the United States next year. And what's a cel'ebration with a
hero nobody knows much about?' Since Rolfe's day, tobacco has grown' to a seven
(B) billion dollar industry, providing employment for_ i~llions and becoming a
major source of'tax revenue for the government. J~)~1r3'0613.

away f'romi any auction area for fear that possiblly .
scratching, our chin might cost us money.
We always thought that tobacco auctioneers de-
liberately try to confuse, but since coming across an
article in the Tobacco News, published! by the Tobacco
Institute, Inc., that opinion has changed.
Joe Bouldin, a tobacco, auctioneer, said: ""A lot of
people think the auctioneer tries to confuse. That's
not so at all. I try to make it as plain as possible. The
chant is an attempt to set a pace you can hold, to get
a rhythm so you, get your buyers walkiing, and biddiing
in that rhythm. Them your sale goes faster and much
more smoothly."
In other words, it's like music, huh, Joe?'
"It"s easier to work in a chant than to shout,"'.1oe
said. "We have to go sometimes five and! a half hours
.a day. Also a chant helps keep your sale moving. VNe
normally try to se11400 piles an hour and that's a lot."
We agree that shouting is not nearly so appealing
as chanting, and wish that rock 'n" rolll singers would
borrow a 1eaffrom the, tlobacep; auctioneer's book. (IGet!
that-leaf?) That would' be nice-a chanting, rock''n'
roll singor;, as difficult to understand now as before.

There is before me, as this is written, a story of how ;
tobacco brought the Union anai the Confederate 'sold'iers to
fraternizing.
It is a remarkable story, as told in the publication
"T B~ AS.f,.1,,NEWS;," here the gist of it: N
ruring the: '.ate internecine conflict, especially the
later years, the soldiers in Gray and in Blue would meet,
secretly in a wood, a barn, or across a stream, thereby ,
violating regulations and providing aid and comfort to the I
enemy, but withi the most' understandable objective of ex-
changing sought-after goods.
The men in Blue coveted good Southern tobacco, while j
the men in Gray were desirous of coffee, and of the two, ~
tobacco was scarcer and more desired; and often the Yank
who brought tobacco to camp was thereby a hero.

Nothing in Excess
Pleasure seems to come at high medi-
cal prices these days. If a man eats steaks
fried in butter, he is told by some au-
thomtiesthat herisks~ heart disease: If
he smokes cigarettes,, others insist he
risks lung cancer. Now a study made in
Iceland, where people have an abnor-
mally high rate of stomach cancer (35 'to
45 per cent' of all cancers in males),
indicates that a heavy diet of' smoked
salmon may be the cause.
Dr. Niels Dungal of' Reykjavik fed
~'smoked fish to rats and one-third de-
~ veloped maltgnant tumors. Further, he
Q found a higher rate of stomach cancer in
~_ districts where people fish for their food:
w Smoked fish, Dr. Dungal reported, con-
tains twns large quantities of polycyclic hydro-
~ e•arbons, known cancer causes.
i, But Dr. Dungal is not pleased with his
findings. "The aim of all cancer workers
,1 is to diminish the pain of the human
V race," Dr. Dungall wrote in The Jlmurnal
~ of the American Medical Association last
\ week. "[;But] the strange outcome of their
work so far has been ~..: to ~ restrict' our
pleasures, if we are to follow their ad-

not smoke; to prevent cervical cancer.

salmon„ one of' the great delicacies

ANYBODY SEEN JOHN R'OLFE?-----------------------'----------'_ (I'3'S)'
Once upon a time, there was a Virginia colonist named John Rolfe, who married
an Indian princess named Pocahontals and went down in history as one of our
leading' ancestors. The trouble is, nobody seems to know mulch about what John
Rolfe looked like, or what manner of man he was. Now , the Jannesto!uvn
Foundation of the Commonweal'th, of Virginia, has offered a five hundred dol'lar
research avrardi for the best historical information about Rolfe -- hils appearance
and his mannerisms. And why the interest in John Rolfe? Well, back in 1612'
when the colony of Jamestowniwas on the brink of economic collapse, Itolfe'
planted and' harvested the first commercially successful crop of'tobacco in this
country. Hie shipped it to England, where it was very popular and the Jamestown
colony was~ saved. This marked the beginning of commerce and industry in the'
Uni'ted States. Well, the nation will celebrate the 350th anniversary of the
tobacco industry i!n, the United States next year. And what's a cel'ebration with a
hero nobody knows much about?' Since Rolfe's day, tobacco has grown' to a seven
(B) billion dollar industry, providing employment for_ i~llions and becoming a
major source of'tax revenue for the government. J~)~1r3'0613.

that an unbot'n baby's he"ar'.t fUutters just like Its

-Mom's Cig~ret
Gives a Liftthe Unb~rli
By JOHN TROANI
You can get a kick out of' smokine even before
-otu're born. A rnetiicaI research team has establiishpd
that an unbot'n baby's he"ar'.t fUutters just like Its
mother's when she puffs on a cigaret.
In fact, the researchers reports the bahv'; heart some-
times starta to race as soon as the mother reaches for
-a smoke.
They say this strange "antici= ,
palory" reaction--which -which occurs even ~. ~
be(nne the mother lights her cioare[' ~:.~~~~~ ~
~
--demonstrates "the impact of ema jt„~',~ 1ri
t:onal responses" on an unborn :

feeiings of an, expectant mother can /~ '~~ M,

blood circulation. - •
. The study was done, with the.alid of a L'SJ Puhlbc

0° Ckis Hammond paper relates various degrees of smoking to 23 "physical complaints,"'
Bch as cough, sore throat, constipation, indigestion, headaches, etc. In
~ '- :lftrtually all of these, he reports a higher ratio of such complaints among
Z ~ okers than among,non-smokers. For,exampley he finds more complaints about
~ oss of weight" among smokers than among:aon-smokers, but also~reports'more ~3rt
~= cr cceplaints about "gain of weight" among smokers
xX t~ .. i C1
''(n2Many different complaints were found to be associated vith smoking habits,"
w~ bZ says in his summary. ,

The second Hammondipaper gives a detailed'breakdown of smoking patterns, by
sex and age,groups. It includes type andiamounts of tobacco used, degree'of'
inhalation, statistics on past smoking, types of cigarettes smoked and their,
"nicotine and tar eontent."
,Another speaker, Dr. Briari MacMahon,`Hazvard professor of epidemiology,
:.discusses the role of statistical studies in determining "causes" of disease,
and cites cigarette smoking,andilung cancer as an erample. "2tis nov'
`estabtiished' beyondiany reasonable doubt that lung cancer would be reduced to ~
:,±'Less than 10% of its present incidence if cigarette smoking,vere discontinued,"
' Dr. MacMahon says. "But some scientists, as vell as business interests, iasist °/
that the 'single cause' of lung cancer iis unknown•"' '
MacMahon says that for the epidemiologist the word "cause" is used in a
different sense than by the clinilcia'nior the laboratory research scientist.

This article on American and Canadian brands of cigarettes includes the magazine's
measurements of "average tars" and'"average nicotine."'
After discussion of'developments since its previous article, the magazine says
"The hazards are notgone from smoki'ng" and cites Dr. Ernest L. Wynder on "the
best way to reduce these hazards."
The article mentions lawsuits against ccmpanies. It discusses The Tobacco Insti-

Ifie-long protection for teen+agers:
In the years 195!4-1960„the'Society gave
$4,000,000 in grants for research in lung
pneer. The Society, pioneered lin major
investigations with ilhe Hammond-Horn
Study, published in 1954. The Society's
edurational activities have increased each
year;,launched in January 1960; the
teen-ageprogram is now of top priority:.
Some public education en"orts ar'e directed
to the entire pubtic-both adults and
youth. An example!is the distribution ofi
"
several million copies of the folder,
"To Smoke or Not to Smoke?!r' Some
efforts are focused on teen-agers only.

BOOKS REVIEWED
Tobacco, Eitperimental and Clinical Studies.
By P. S. Larson, Ph.D., H. B. Haag,, M.D., andl
Hl Silvette, Ph.D. Quarto of 932 pages. Balti-
more, The Williams dz Wilkins Company, 1961.
Cloth,i20.
One of the most frequent questions patients ask
is whether or not they should stop smoking (and
`, then, they proceed to convince the physician that
~' tl3ey will "cut it down"). There is evidence which
(~ may justify the interdiction, of smoking in hyper-
tension or in gastric ulcer-and certainly in periph-
eral eral vascular disease. That evidence comes from
040 scattered papers; intensive and integrated studies i
m surveying, the fieldl are not readily available: The
present book supplies such an exhaustive study,
~ perhaps for the first time.
The project resulting,in the book was supported.
~ during, its final stages by the Tobacco Industry
~' R;esearch Committee: Despite the support, it
~ should not be concluded that' the work represents ian
\ apologia for tobacco, nor on the other hand that
the selection of material from the literature was
unbiaseda--or biased. But it'would'have been much
better to have omitt,edi the laudatory referencesi to
tobacco and those on the moral aspects of its use;
many of them do not deserve to be given weight
in the light of' modenn, medical views.. Eveni if
they are cited for historical reasons or to add levity,
they give the appearance of a pro bias, though that
may not be t'he case:
The book consists of abstracts from,the literature
through 19'59 and the authors! comments on 6,000
articles from 1y2©0 journals of the literature on
tobacco. This tremendous amount of materiall is
arranged by pharmacolbgic effectL Thus the effect
of tobacco or nicotine in man or other animals on i the
nervous syetemy blood, gastrointestinal tract, muscle,
cardiovascular system, special senses, respiration,
and!so forth, is met here. Also, the effect of tobacco
on the metabolism of various eubst+ances„ repro-
ductive organs, endocrine glands, the relation of
tobacco to hypersensitivity andl its toxic effects,
immunologic aspects, and the relationship, to
specific diseases and, organs are well detailed.
This is perhaps the most' comprehensive singlee
work on tobacco. In it will be found data on such
questions as the effect of tobacco on lactation and
nursing as welllas in other conditions and functions.
Yet,the impressively large bibliography could havee
been matched by a better index. For, example,
such an important' phenomenon in relation to
tobacco as vasoconstriction is not found here readiHy
though information on vasoconstriction is indeed
supplied. The index is arrangedl by effects of
tobacco on bodig systems or body elements, ratherr
than in a straight, expanded, alphabetical fashion.
This book willllong continue to be a fountain
of reference andlquotataon-in andiout of context.-

Nothing in Excess
Pleasure seems to come at high medi-
cal prices these days. If a man eats steaks
fried in butter, he is told by some au-
thomtiesthat herisks~ heart disease: If
he smokes cigarettes,, others insist he
risks lung cancer. Now a study made in
Iceland, where people have an abnor-
mally high rate of stomach cancer (35 'to
45 per cent' of all cancers in males),
indicates that a heavy diet of' smoked
salmon may be the cause.
Dr. Niels Dungal of' Reykjavik fed
~'smoked fish to rats and one-third de-
~ veloped maltgnant tumors. Further, he
Q found a higher rate of stomach cancer in
~_ districts where people fish for their food:
w Smoked fish, Dr. Dungal reported, con-
tains twns large quantities of polycyclic hydro-
~ e•arbons, known cancer causes.
i, But Dr. Dungal is not pleased with his
findings. "The aim of all cancer workers
,1 is to diminish the pain of the human
V race," Dr. Dungall wrote in The Jlmurnal
~ of the American Medical Association last
\ week. "[;But] the strange outcome of their
work so far has been ~..: to ~ restrict' our
pleasures, if we are to follow their ad-
vice: To prevent lung cancer we should
not smoke; to prevent cervical cancer.
.aometv should be nuns;, and to avoid
stomach cancer we should avoid smoked
salmon„ one of' the great delicacies
of' the table. Maybe we should! be
g4uded in all these things by the old,
golden rule of ancient Greekse Nothing
in excess..

Says Snuff
1s Safer
London, Dec: 1 (AP) -Shuff
may be unfidier than cigarets
but, a British, medical expert
deelares, it is a lot less likely
to cause lung cancer, bronchitis
and coronary thrombosis.
Sir Derrick Dunlop, professor
of therapeutics and cl'inica'. medii
cine at Edinburgh University,
offered this adivice at a confer-
.ence of the British Chest and
Heart Assn.
"Smokers," he said, "would do
well to transfer their addictioa
for cigarettes to pipes and
cigars, which seem less danper•
ous-or still better to sniff6
which beside be being less detri-
mental is a great deal cheaper."
Snuff4 as the younger ger:era•
tion muy not know „ is a pre-
paration of puliverized! tobacco
which may be sniffed up thee
nose or held in the form of' a
wad under the lower lip. A diis=
advantage of tue wad technique
is that those who employ it
must, like tobacco chewers„have
some place to spit.

MILD DOSE OF POISON'
Sit back, light up a cigarette, and' watch out.
io/ A burning cigarette produces carbon monoxide-a surpris~
v ing amount of it, too.
Not enough i of it to kill you, but maybe enough to give you
~ a headache.
"A heavy smoker concei vably couid' get a headache, or
o}her symptoms, by inhaling the carbon monoxide in the smoke,"
~ said H: Grady Callison Jr., an engineer in the radiological
~ aaid oceupationali health division of the State Bioard' of Health.
To prove his point, Callison took a device known as a carbon
monoxide detector, held it in the smoke several inches over
two burning, cigarettes, and gave one squeeze.
Th
e device sueked in the smoke, and Callison gave out' the
~ findinR: 200 parts of carbon monoxide In a million parts of air.
Q "The maximum allowable concentration of' carbon monoxide
O lr 1UO parts in a million over an exposure period of eight

~ "With an exposure of eight, hours to 200 parts, some people
would develop mild symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning,,"

pared her findings with data from,
five previous studies of' students
in England, Sedtland, Maine,
Canada.
Her research, was supported in
part by the Pu-nerican Cancer So-
ciety, but no attem{&gt;f was made
to relate smoking to lung cancer.
Dr. Salber found that slightly
more than ha1f tne students en-
rolled at Newton High School in
November, i959, smoked. More
girls than boys were among the
regular ;smokers; she reported, bnt
Uhe boys tended to smoke more
heavily.
Forty-six per cent of' the boys
and 55 per cenb of the girls were
smokers, according, to the survey.
A smoker, as defined by Dr.

Pritchard against Liggett &amp; Myers had ended in a lower court, in
Pittsburgh, in a directed verdict against the plaintiff. The court held,
there was insufficient evidence to present to a jury.

The appellate tribunal

sufficient to merit' a new trial is a harsh blow to the Washington-based
institute as well as to the industry and its ad agencies. The appellate
~ruling was based, among other things, on t'he fact that Pritchardl could' "
show Chesterfield ads representing, the product' as "safe," and could
argue that the company should have known the alleged relationship
between cancer and smoking.

members of the Tobacco Growers Committe~e meeting in the Hotel Jefferson
here in Ptichmond. ~.., , .




Little told the tobacco men that there are many
factors in the causation of lung cancer to be considered before the
effects of smoking can be considered at all.
..: 'He said that the statement that smoking causes cancer...`'

discourages research...is unfair to the layman...and over simplifies the
real and true nature of cancer.




He went on to say cancer is not similar to other diseases.:.


it does not kill the cell but rather makes it grow faster. He said

research is showing that there is a real difference between the sexes in

'-lung disease susceptability. More men die of'all respiratory diseases
than do women. TB and'pneumonia patients are more susceptible to cancer.
They seem to develop the disease around the lung lesions.

Exhaust fumes are also a factor inihealth Dr. Little
'He said one of the popular conceptions of the day is
:that viruses cause cancer and that if viruses could be checked...cancer
could be checkedi. He went on to7point out that this has not been con-
clusively proveniby medical men.


The emotional and environmental make-up of cancer victims

is being studied to determine these effects on the causation of csncer..



The assertion that lung csncei= is caused by smoking,has
not been medically proven,, Dr. Little said. He said the research cvnt3inues...

Dr. T1. F. h[AN[.Z7eo (Columbus) pleaded for more attention

was followed by Professor Emeritus R. R'. hlewEr:L, who

caused lung cancer was one which had operated in, Baglisad'
before emigration. This might be air pollution whic• saattr,
exert its effect either directly by virtue of its carcinoluda
nature or less directly by producing an antecedent and'
predisposing,chronic bronchius: Thrpanelldiscussion which
followed this session was the only one of three to go with
any sense of reality and purpose, and one felt that open
questions from the audience would have produced more

Can't ywu visualize a scene

for smoking filter tips and why
one is better than i the other.
Somehow, the tips seemi ordi:

side the romance of the old-time
tips.
Some manufacturer could, for
example„ put o(it tips that match
womenis lipstick, or even their

Why not~ invent tips containing
chlorophyll? Then you could ad-
vertise eliminating smoker's
breath while smoking.

For the after&lt;iinner smoker
the tips coald contain an antacid
mint to relieve indigestion.
To make it easier for the be-

devised that allbwed no smoke
to come through, thus prevent-
ing embarrassing cougliing, or
choking.
Ah, yes. John could go on and
on. But he doesn't want to give
away all his tips. Who knows.
Some manufacturer might' just

BOOKS REVIEWED
Tobacco, Eitperimental and Clinical Studies.
By P. S. Larson, Ph.D., H. B. Haag,, M.D., andl
Hl Silvette, Ph.D. Quarto of 932 pages. Balti-
more, The Williams dz Wilkins Company, 1961.
Cloth,i20.
One of the most frequent questions patients ask
is whether or not they should stop smoking (and
`, then, they proceed to convince the physician that
~' tl3ey will "cut it down"). There is evidence which
(~ may justify the interdiction, of smoking in hyper-
tension or in gastric ulcer-and certainly in periph-
eral eral vascular disease. That evidence comes from
040 scattered papers; intensive and integrated studies i
m surveying, the fieldl are not readily available: The
present book supplies such an exhaustive study,
~ perhaps for the first time.
The project resulting,in the book was supported.
~ during, its final stages by the Tobacco Industry
~' R;esearch Committee: Despite the support, it
~ should not be concluded that' the work represents ian
\ apologia for tobacco, nor on the other hand that
the selection of material from the literature was
unbiaseda--or biased. But it'would'have been much
better to have omitt,edi the laudatory referencesi to
tobacco and those on the moral aspects of its use;
many of them do not deserve to be given weight
in the light of' modenn, medical views.. Eveni if
they are cited for historical reasons or to add levity,
they give the appearance of a pro bias, though that
may not be t'he case:
The book consists of abstracts from,the literature
through 19'59 and the authors! comments on 6,000
articles from 1y2©0 journals of the literature on
tobacco. This tremendous amount of materiall is
arranged by pharmacolbgic effectL Thus the effect
of tobacco or nicotine in man or other animals on i the
nervous syetemy blood, gastrointestinal tract, muscle,
cardiovascular system, special senses, respiration,
and!so forth, is met here. Also, the effect of tobacco
on the metabolism of various eubst+ances„ repro-
ductive organs, endocrine glands, the relation of
tobacco to hypersensitivity andl its toxic effects,
immunologic aspects, and the relationship, to
specific diseases and, organs are well detailed.
This is perhaps the most' comprehensive singlee
work on tobacco. In it will be found data on such
questions as the effect of tobacco on lactation and
nursing as welllas in other conditions and functions.
Yet,the impressively large bibliography could havee
been matched by a better index. For, example,
such an important' phenomenon in relation to
tobacco as vasoconstriction is not found here readiHy
though information on vasoconstriction is indeed
supplied. The index is arrangedl by effects of
tobacco on bodig systems or body elements, ratherr
than in a straight, expanded, alphabetical fashion.
This book willllong continue to be a fountain
of reference andlquotataon-in andiout of context.-

Judge Staley wrote: •

that Pritchard had prodticedi

Dr. Rosenblat, who is a New
Yoik 1Vlediical' College professor
and an author of a textbook of
cancer of the lung, said the
spectacular increase in this type
ofl cancer is due "chiefly to im•

Although for 301 years doctors
"have studied lung cancer "with

The widely held belief that a'

. ,
was pooh-poohed Sunday by a
prominent New York ehesC aur-
`"
geon before the annual post-
graduate clinic of the Niichigan
general practitioners. e •
ldit
Dr. Milton B. Riosenblatt' to~
the doctors that while the num- f,
ber ofdeaths~~ from lungcancer '?`w,',~~
has steadily risen in the last 3: :'..
30 years, the rate of increase
has slowed. This despite the
steady increa,e in smokinR, st i;

"The 6o t'a 1' number of
deaths increased from 2.500
to 3ii00ID In 1960, but' the rate
of tncrease declined from 79
per cent to 33 per centiDr.
Rosenblatt said.
. . :

In due ti~ne, the doctor pre+
dicted, the incidence of lung
.cancer will stabilize. The ap- °
parent epidemic was due prri'-
marily to the fact lung cancer
has become more accessible to
diagnosis within a relatively
short span of' years, he said.

He stressed that, except in "
cases of' great, brain injuries.
the intelligence of epileptics
was •the same as the rest of
the populati~mni
Some states, Dr. Thomass
said, deny the epileptic the
right to marry unless he iss
sterilized. Drivers' licenses are
too severely restricted. Some
victints of the disease hide their
disability because they need a
driver's license to work.

°``NiIA'MI BEACH, Fla.-Accord- . ` •'Well, I'11l be . . ." " muttered
ing to a group of, heart research- the doctor. There was no dit
"ers who spoke to members of the ference. Smoking.doesn't affect
American Heart Assn. here on my heart as it does in some
,-Friday, I shouldl have heart dis- people who take this test. Dur-
_ ease. ing the next two hours, Dr. Buff l
11 do all the wrong, things. I eat, conducted several other tests,,
meat, smoke heavily, lead a hec- a'ith the same result. My heart
.. tic life, and am overweight. I Is normal, and is doing its job.
" also have a history' of heart dis- as quietly and efficiently as in
ease in my family. At my current most' men, 10 to 20 years young-
age these things should be evi-
denced by narrowed and, inelastic
arteries (atherosclerosis).
But I've just bad an ex-
tiaustive checkup by Charlestonn
heart specialist Dr. I. E. Buff-
using some of the newest diag-
nostic equipment on display dur.
Ing the convention-and the doc-
tor gives me a clean, bill of'
healthi
"There's nothing wrong with
your heart,"' be said, "and there's
no evidence of the narrowed ar-
teries I expected to find."'
Dr. Buff admitted he was
puzzled. A lifelong non. smoker, he
believes cigarettes are a cause of
.beart disease, and offered to
prove it to me. He led me to aa
ballistocardiographic machine.
... "Ballistocardiography is contro-~
t+ersial,"' the doctor emphasized,
"but it seems to be returning to
" favor." Recalling that Dr; Paul.
Dudley White of Boston advocates
the technique as part', of ai com-
plete plcte heart'eheckup,, I waved Dr.
Buff's qualifying statement aside.
The word of' the doctor who was
called to the side of President Ei-
senhower when he was stricken
by a heart attack is good enough
_ ,
for me.
. . .
THE TECHNIQUE of baili'sto-
cardiography is relatively simple
in principle. Lying quietly on a
table supported only by a super-
sensitive measuring device, the
beating of my heart was making
my whole body bounce around
ever so slightly.
The ballistocardiograph meas-
ures the amount of bounce and
jolt in terms of pure motion,
rather than converting the heart-
beat pattern into ~ electrical im-
pulses as an electrocardiogram;
does. i
Dr. Buff'took two readings, be-
fore and after I smoked a cigar-
ette, then compared the t!wo sets
of' squiggles recorded on paper
tape:
er.
I met Dr. Buff as he was
browsing, among the scientific-ex-
hibits of the big, American Heart
Assn. meeting, and, I had just
come from a panel discussion on
the probable causes of heart dis-
eases. -
Cigarettes were only one of sev-
eral' things implicated as causes
of heart disease. Eating, meat and
cther animal fats was also cited
as a causative factor by Dr. J.
Gordon Barrow of A'tlanta. Ga:
because he found, heart disease
much more prevalent among
Benedictine monks who eat' a nor-
mal' diet tihan among, Trappist
monks who eat no meat.
. . .
STRESS in the daily life was
also cited. Dr. Henry Russek of
Staten Island, N. Y. saidithere is
more heart disease among general
practitioners than specialists in
the three professions of law, medi-
cine an&amp; dentistry: Since the gem
eral practitioners must cope with
a greater variety of problems in
their work than the specialists.
Dr. Russek called' theirs "a more
stressful life."
Heredity is another factor. Dr.
Daniel Brunner of' Tel Aviv, Isra-
el reported'that Yemenite Jews in
his country are completely free of'
atherosclerosis until they reach
very advanced ages-about 70 or,
so. This racial group apparently
inherits some protection against
deterioration of~ the arteries, whilee
most other races inherit suscep-
tibility in varying degrees.
All these things apply to me.
To reduce my chances of bav-
ing heart disease, it appeared
that I should stop smoking, be-
eome a ve$etarian, shed about
25 pounds of welght, give up the
work that requires me to chase
unpredictable scientists around
the countryside - and arrange
to be born ~ again of parents who
didn't die of heart disease, as
mv father didl
Dr. Jeremiah Stamler of Chica,
mo; who moderated l the panel dis-
cussion, agreed. Ii was glumly
considering my short remaining
life expectancy when I rnet! Dr.
Buff in the exhibit hall.
I'tn much more cheerful now.
I've had the works in medicali
diagnosis, even including electro-
cardiograph readings taken while
11 was engaged' in exercise.
This is tricky. It required that
I be "lvired" with electrodes fas-
tened securely to my skin, and
hold a smalll radio transmitter
that broadcast the action of my
heart as I went up and' down
steps, walked around the exhibit
hall, and jumped up and down nn
one toot'. An antenna caught the
signals and' recorded' them hnth
on p a p e r and as "blips" on a
viewing screen.
r r a _
DR. SAMUEL BELLET of the
University of' Pennsylvania School
of Medicine, who developed the
radio braadcastind method of tak-
ing eleLtrocardiograph readings
(the standard, technique requires
that the patient be still', lest mus-
cle movements drown out the
heartbeat)points out ttrat' many
more heart defects are found dur-
ing exercise than when at' rest'.
These are t'hee small defects that
show up ~ only when the heart mus6
work hard:
The equipment, unflortunately.
is too expensive for most doctors'
offices. It costs $2,110, andi only
a few research institutions have
it so far.
.14y hear behaved' beautifully
durin: exercise. Dr. Buff made
sure t^y switching the electrodes
to scveral different points. "Per-
fectty normal," he said.
I also had my bloodl tested
for beta - lipoprotein content,
since the beta-iipoproteins are
the fats now suspected of'being
the chief troublemakers in coat-
ing the inner walls of' arteries
to make them narrower; less
rizstic, and therefore more like-
IA; to trap, blood l clots..
Such a clot in the artery serv.
iu;; the heart muscle is the classic
t%-pe of heart attack. In an artery.
~c•.rvinm the brain, it causes a
G. oke.
I had lo wait fr,r thc hiouat lo
anal; zed, and got' the verdict ,at- _
er. The reading, was "high, but
not abnormal - in about' the top
10' per cent of the.normai range."
Dr. Buff wanted to measure my
blood pressure, but' couldn't. AI'
the medical equipment manufac-.
turers were exhibiting their new •
and l fancy items and there wasn't
a single booth that had a rubber
cuff apparatus for measuring
blood pressure. I know from fre-
quent checks that it's essentially
normal, however, so that waso't
too important. : -


ALL IN ALL, I'm much le«
afraid of heart disease now than
when Dr. Buff started his tests.
"Sometimes it's hardl to apply
the results of' research to prac-
tice," said Dr. Buff. "When I
eome to medical'meetings I usual-
-ly learn more by comparing notes
with other cardiologists - peoplee
who do the same work I do - than
from the research report's."'
Another doctor, from Michigani
summed up the situation t h i s
_
way:
"We've got a lot' to learn yet."

a complete cure of " a permanent contraction of'the muscles

wonder whether such huge compilations of " good work and

THis astonishing, labour' is justly dedicated' to the authors'
wives' " incredible patience ", for it contains a, survey of over
6000 articles from 1200 journals on topics ranging from a case-
report of 1848'describing the use of a tobacco enema,in effecting,
a complete cure of " a permanent contraction of'the muscles
originating on the right side of the pelvis " to a detailed survey
of the question of smoking andl lung cancer. Some may
wonder whether such huge compilations of " good work and
bad„sound and uninformed opinion "'serve any useful purpose
beyond that supplied by a simple bibliography. Sometimes the
authors act the part of informed guides, but not aliways. . It
may well be that the future of such books, designed to coverr
the whole of the past of a subjecty will'rather lie in the criticall
review, supplemented by a fullI and classified bibliography.
Whatever the answer,, there is no disputing that anyone
interestedi in any aspect of tobacco will findl his knowledge
extended if he consults this compendium, which has been
partly supported by the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.

" Q{ians are attempting to
. Ihleasure the effectiveness
of talk as a weapon against
smoking.
This month, 17' physi-

dangers of'smoking to more
than 13,000 students in 23'
j}anior high schools, in the
annual smoking education pro-
graQnl of the Broome County
Medical Society. .
A new twi'st, this year is 9 ques-
tionnaire which the doctbrs will'
hand out to the students after lec-
tures, to find out how many ciga-
rets they smoke, and whether or
not they plan to cut down or stop
smoking as a result of the lec•
ture.
The program got under way toa
day when Dr. Gerald J. E. An-
seili spoke to about 600 students
at West' Jiunior High School.
Dr. Mark H. Williams, chair-
inan, of' the Medica:' Society's
Smoking Education Committee, al-

searchers at Rosw•e1T I41rk Me-
morial Institute in Buffalo are con-
firming earlier evidence that lung
cancer is more frequent in, smok-
ers than in non-smokers.
Dr. Williams said more than
2,000 new cases of lung cancer
have been, discovered in New York
State this year. '
Lungs, he, said, are the most
common site oflcancer among men
in upstate New York..
Response to the talks last year,
when the program was started as
the first' of its kind ever carried
out by a medical society in the
U. S., was "enthusiastic," Dr.

YOURSELF .
By DR. PETER J. STEINCROHN
urnacn hl ature ls Perverse
The perverseness of'humann
nature! When we are strug-
gling up the rocky road to
success we are advised to be
neat; to keep our one suit
pressed and spotless; to keep
- our one pair of shoes shined.
Good appearance is an es-
sential' quality if you ex -
peet to get ahead. How you
look forward to enough fi-
nancial security to be able
to have dozens of pairs of
shoes, a closet-full of' expen-
sive suits.
Comes the great day. You
are rich'! What do you do?
You get' tired of looking like
a male clothes -horse. After
a while. There's nothing you
like more than dressing in
an ' o1d pair of slacks,
banged up shoes apd shirt'
open at the collar. People
say: "He's rich enough to.
dress like a tramp."
STATUS COMES in many
guises i For example, consider
' •illness. ' IIntil' recently we
thought t'hat' gout was a dis-
ease of high society-that it'
attacked kings and great in-
dustrialists: No w we knohv
that Joe Doakes Is iust as
susceptible. We were also.
wrong about ulcer. of t'he.
-st'omaeh or duodenum. People
in high places bragged, about
their ulcers as if they were
wearing badges of distinc-
,tion. Not true. Anyone, any-
place, can get an ulcer: Of-
fice boy or president of the
firm.
Oha for the good oldi days
wheni a, fellow could sit down
to, a meal and enjoy it: These
days, so many of us are con-
science-stricken-or actually
scared to death-when we
eat,
When we take a drink we

think of cirrhosis of the
liver. When we smoke we
wonder about cancer of'the
lung. When we eat pie a la
mode we worry about excess:
weight. When we eat a tasty
morsel of fat which edges,

mind: Many of' the things
which we seem to sure of to-

Cornfield' said. smoking, would have no effect, ;
"Actually the number of'
`deat'hs from cardio-vascular dis-
`. ease (heart-circulatory) is much
•greater than from lung cancer,"
-he said, citing a number of'stud-
ies of such deaths froml smokers
and non-smokers.
"Every year 30;00U people die
of I lung cancer," he said, "and
perhaps several hundred thou-
sandlother people die every year
of diseases that may be asso-
ciated with ciga!rette smoking."
he said - but it does lower mor- '
tality rates, depending uponihow
long the smoker has stopped
smoking.
It does not necessarily follow
'that cigarette smokers have a,
high mortality rate because they
are cigarette smokers, Mr. Corn•
field conceded. - ;~
Nevertheless, he told I an inter-
viewer later, he himself' stopped
smoking about five years ago,
after becoming convinced' of the
risk.
` "'. INCREe'.SE CITED CONVERSION FAILS
•.Pointing to a, chart which
showed that cancer of the lung
and bronchus has steadily in.
,creased in thes country since
;1914, Mr. Cornfield said' that
some argue that it is due' to bet-
aer diagnosis of the disease in
more recent years.
If soi he said wryly, then can-
.cer of the lungs in men is diag-
nosed much better than in, wom-
en, because the increase in the
disease among men is up much
more than among women.
The data strongly, suggests that
"something new" has been in-
troduced in the environment
which promotes lung cancer,
whether gasoline fumes, air pol-
lution or cigarette smoking,, he
said. The studies do not agree as
to the amount of the Increased
"I made a strenuous effort to

said.
How, much has he improvedl

"I don't have to get up quite
as early in the morning to get
my coughing done," he replied.

Cornfield spoke was remarkabiy

and bronchi of a pack-a-day smoker, up to 100 grams of tar yearly. Research in
carcinogens is hamperedlbg- the tacts that mice and rabbits cannot be taught to
smoke, and although chimpanzees can, they do no4 so far, inhale. Animals range in
increasing sensitivity to nicotine from centipedes, spiders, butterflies, fish and
-frogs through idogs, rabbits and (very sensitive) carts.,Sheep chew on tobacco leaves
without much efTect';,elephanrts Ret,sleepy.
What type of person smolres?'
Various studies provide a mass of intriguing:and indigestible information. Smokers
seem to marry, move, change jobs and' be hospitalized more tham nonsmokers.
Members of antismoking religious sects smoke the least; journal'ists;, teachers and
criminals smoke the moati Smokers dislike mathematics in school, and later select
- artisticcareers, while nonsmokers are scientifically inclined. Smokers complain 300
per cent more often than nonsmokers of'coughing,167 per cent more often of nose
and throat'trouble, 50 per cent more of heart palpitation, 100 per cent more of
" heartburn, 76 per cent more of nervousness. .. .
- . Male smokers, in one study„were found to be less masculine, more inhibitediand
shy„less well integrated, more intuitive, creative and sensitive. They drink more
alcohol and coffee, have more restless energy, excel in, the arts; letters and phi-
losophy, and dislike hard physical work.
Women smokers have a greater incidence of frigidity,, steril'ity, menstrual dis-
turbances and miscarriages than nonsmokers. They are more apt to be "oc•
oasional"" or social smokers than meni
H'igh-schoollstudents whosmoke are,,on the whole, older than their nonsmoking
elassmates: They participate less frequently in athletics and other extracurricular
activities, and take less demanding courses scholastically. More girls than boys in-
dulge in solitary smoking and,"rebellious'" smoking-against their parents' wishes;,
only 10 per cent of students smoke: when, their parents forbid it.

Why do people start smoking? :. .
A study of' 20,000 high•school students reported about a quarter of the boys
: and an eighth of the girls were "regular" smokers. Ands this average included all
four grades-by senior year 35' per cent of the boys and126 per cent of the girls
were smoking. The same study showed a definite correlation between parental and
adolescent smoking. The. percentage is highest (boy,s,, 32 per cent; girls„ 18.5 per
cent),,,if both parents smoke; lowest (boys, 17 per cent; girls, 7'per cent) if'neither
parent smokes.
'
^
Why do people stop smoking?
.~
Mostly for reasons of'heabth. The yearly death rate from all causes is 60 per cent
higher among,regular cigarette smokers thaniamong nonsmokers; among smokers
who consume more than,two packs a day, the rate is 123 per cent higher. In coro-
nary heart disease;, the death, rate is 7 0 per, cent higher among, cigarette: smokers *
than among nonsmokers; the prevalence of peptic ulcer is twice as high among
smokers as among nonsmokers;,almost three fourths of'immoderate smokers show
symptoms of chronic bronchitis.
. . -
Of course, the most dramatic fia res concern cancer of the lung, a disease al.
most unknown 50 years agoi,which killed 36,000 Americans last year. Death from
lung,cancer is ten times higher among smokers than among nonsmokers, and if the
present rate continues, more than a million of today's school children willld'ie of it.
A recent sampling;of praeticing,physiciansshow.s that 21out of 3.believe that smok
ing is the major cause of lung cancer, 1 in 5 doubts it, 1 in 7 is undecided. People
present interesting arguments against this.relationship (ltang cancer is more com-
mon in cities than in rural areas, which suggests an air-pollution factor; its inci
dence is higher among,low-income groups, which suggests a sociological factor;
nonsmokers may be constitutionally or genetically more self-protective thani
smokers, and thus better able to resist disease),,.. but so far the weight of evidence
supports the cancer-cigarette theory.
Is there any way to avoid the dangers of smoking;, short of quitting
entirely?'
Filter tips are more or less (28-51 per cent) successful in reducing the tar con2entof
cigarette smoke; unfortunately, a thirdlof the smokers:who switch to filters admit
they smoke more cigarettes. Smoking in moderation is of course preferable to smok-
ing, excessively.
For the present„t'he sensible approach seems to be alogical appeal to high+school
students which could;, in four years' time, prevent from smoking 20 per cent who
otherwise would have formed the habit. Confirmed'adult smokers will have to de-
cide for themselves. The fact that, in a five-year periodJ 30,000,000 Americans
switched to filters suggests that the problem of smoking,is much on their minds.
When asked by his doctor to smoke more moderately,, former President Eisen-
hower decided to stop entirely. "If a persom quits pitying himself,'"' he said, "he
won't find'it nearly, so bad to quit smoking as he thinks he will." END

Dr. Milton B. Riosenblatt' to~

Rosenblatt said.

In due ti~ne, the doctor pre+
dicted, the incidence of lung

LOidID(1N-The breathing ca'pa-
citv of tobacco smokers has been
linked to heredity as well as en-
vironment.
In a study of BY2'smokers andi
-wn-smokeis in the out-patientl
department of' the Sydney (Aus•
tralia) Hospital, researchers re-
p!orted! that the effect of tobaccroi
smoke alone does not accounti
for decreased' breathing capacity:
The mild climate and retative-
ly unpoilittedI atmosphere of, Syd-
ney was believed more favorable
for the study:
Persons interviewed and testedl
for maximum breathing capacity,
and expiratory flow rate a•ere
representative of the generatl
population and included triend&amp;
acc+ompanying the out-patients„
as well as medical attendants.
Although smokers generally,
~ had eight to 10 times pnore btron+
chitic syrttptoms than non-smok-
ers„ heavier sm.oldng, for a longer
period of time showed no in-
crease in symptoms. There :vas
al4;o no tendency for heavy'
smokers to taave pocrer breathing
capacity than light smokers:.
The researchers said that the
genetic make-up among smokers
would determine whether a per
son coughed and developed bron-
chitic symptoms with serious loss
of breathing capacity, or showed
no symptoms and lost a small
amount of ventilatory function.
Further investigation was suo

Dr. Joseph Berkson of the Mayo ticians who noted that the reported
be on the wrong track in blaming given the subject of smoking and lung
cancer on smoking. cancer was initiated by some statis-
stiatisticians in Faris' that they may "The worldwidie attenti0ni r•ecently
' cently told a meeting of medical He said:
causes cancer." In an area where
s toliaoco is the mainstay of the econ-
-ony, that is:s important news. .
.-Dr. Beritson does not rule out smok-
ing -as a cause of cancer but he points
to studies which stiow too. many in•
terxelationships to point to one thing
as a cause
He said, a scientific study In Fng-
land' showed the incidence of lung
cancer rises in relation to cigaret
consumption.
Another study fn the United States
gave •graphic evidence that smoking
causes death, from coronary heart di-
sease, he added. The chart line rises
at' almost the same rate as for
the cigaret-lung cancer study.
Dr. Berkson asserted' still another
study with appropriate graphs indi-
catedl that degenerative heart di-
sease Is closely linked to fat con-
sumption. And in • a study of his own
Dr. Berkson showed a connection be-
tween degenerative heart disease and
protein consumption.
"`My point is," Dr. Berkson_ said,
"that heart 'disease may ae aggara.
vated, by Amoking, by fat consump-
tion, by protein consumption - the
statistiics are there to prove any
case - but' it is dangerous to, pick
out' one cause and _say that is thd
only one. There may still be rflany,
others. Theze are too many inter-

.•"Zt was procla4med that a pandem.
ic (general epidemic) of, lung can-
cer was upon us and if' we did not, do
something about it we would all be
dying, of lung cancer and fairly soon.
Now it is quite true that the reported
death, rate from lung cancer has ris-
en, but is this the only change in
death rates that was occurring over
the period? Hardly!
"Taking the United States as -an
exam ple, it is to be noted' that in
the same period the death rate from
all causes at' the same ages has
been decreasing and the expectationn
of life even at these older ages has
been increasing. . . .
"To seize upon one element of these
secular changes - the rise of the
deatli rate from lung cancer - at-
tach to it what appears to be a plaus-
ible explanation, and ride herd on
thi&amp; explanation, without relating it'tio lother con-comitant changes - this
impresses one as the fallacy of' mis-
pSaced concreteness in, a fairly vicious
form."
Dr. Berkson's argument may be
small comfort! for those who wish
evidence to rule tobacco out as a,
cause for cancer, but at,ieast it tendss
to render the charge far less certaRn,
of accuracy.

By Mary Ellen Wolfe
.. Journal Hera/d Stalf Writer
If students don't smoke before they enter collese, it's a good
.bet they will be smokers by the tnme they graduate.
;"In a lot of ways, college students are being encouraged to
smoke;" IDr.'Douglass Thompson, director of student health sen•-
lces at the University of' Pittsburgh, said here yesterday.
--Thompson recently completed a pilot survey of student
health directors at 1100 U.S. colleges. He reports:
"I have found colleges seem to encourage smoking by letting
' tobacco firms give away free cigarettes at registration and in
`~, dining rooms, by sponsoring cigarette contests on campus„ ann.
by permitting, tobacco advertising in school papers."'
'
S nw
everalespapers reported on surveys of smoking attitudes.

year-round ban at some colleges
to leaving the matter up to irn
dividual coaches.
4. Most colleges permit ac-

THE FL~IDIPIGS are reflected
by practices in Dayton area col-
leges.
At the University of' Dayton.
Rev. Charles L. Uollins, dean, of'
students; said: . .

"The only thing we do Is
limit the places students can
smoke. Fbr co•eds, it is re-
stricted to their Ibunge.

Antioch college permits smok-

it might be different . . . As
long as tive can get along with-

just as well off."

Df I A h'I Ii UNIVERSITY has.
been the recipient of snide coitt,

of "No Smoking" signs put' up

ette tax money: Since 1956, that
has been the source of funds for

Now after a year and a half
of not smoking, he wants to

still craves smoking andi can
-~hardly stand it when some-
one else smokes. He even
says he Is Irritable and ner-
vous when he doesn't.
"~ "I was always afraid of
cancer of the lung. I am

less likely to be. dangerous
as far as cancer goes. Is this
true: and what sre the
chances? I would like to be
relieved of this worry.
'
_Mrs. F. S.11
ANSWER:
Lat tts start otxt by saving
three things:
1.-D don't think tobacco
does anybody any good.
2-I have come to, accept
the fact that sotne peopiee
are just bound to worry
about, something, or other;
and if you deprive tliem of'
one worry, they soon find
another.; It's sort of' an ad-
diction.

up to them. But itts up to me
married, (and other doctors) to lmak.
sure they know that there's
a probable risk.
He Mrs. P.S., I can't tell yourr
husband not' to smoke ciga-
rets. (But YOU told him and
got away with it!)
I can say he should orr
shouldn't smoke a pipe.' The
pipe carries a 'risk; although
apparently a much lesser one.
There's a considerable and,
logical contention that.. air
pollution contributes to luilcr
cancer-but I can't tell every.
There isn't any evidence
that cigarets are the 'solee
cause of lung eanoer. People
who never have smoked'some-
times have it. 'But it Is far
more frequent among those
who do. ThaU's the story.
after.
3-I don't, know what to
do about either!
Now let me explain why I
prepounded these deep
thoughts. And let me go at
It backwards. 11 happen too
know, tthe man, a very fine
statistician, who analyzed
the first massive set of fig-
ures which led to our belief'
that cigareta have an inilu-
enee on lung cancer.
He smoked cigarets him-
self4 But' when, after several
years of collecting figures
and figuring out percentages,
It became clear that' cigarets
had some long-range influ-
ence in encouraging Iung
cancer, he quits cigarets.
Just-like-that. He now
smokes a pipe alli the time
-regardless of the fact that
he has long known, that per-
petual p i p e-sm ok i n g has
some influence in encourag-
ing cancer of the lip, tongue
or mouthl
I'm not -one to say that
people shouldn'tsmeke. That''s
counnent

reader mail, but regrets thaa
due to the tremendous vol-
ume received daily;, he is nn-

Once upon a time, there was a Virginia colonist named John Rolfe, who married
an Indian priincess named Pocahontas and went down in history as one of our - :
leading, ancestors. The trouble is, nobody seems to know much about what John
Rolfe looked like, or what manner of man he was. Now, the Jamestown
Foundation of the Commonwealth of Virginia, has offered a five hundred dollar
major source of tax revenue for the government.
(B~)! billion dollar indu~stry, pr~oviding~ employment for million&amp; andl becaming~ a,
research award for the best historical information about Rolfe -- his appearance
and hils mannerisms. And why the interest in John Ro1fe?' Well, back in 1612
when, the colony of Jamestown was on the brink of economic collapse, Rolfe
planted and harvested the first commercially successful crop of tobacco in this
country. He shipped it to England, where it was very popular and the Jamestown
colony was saved. This marked the beginning of commerce and industry in the
United States. Well, the nation will celebrate the 350th anniversary of the .
tobacco industry in the United States next year. And what"s a celebration with a
hero nobody knows much about? Since Rolfe's day, tobacco has grown to a seven

Two.prot~gonists in tYle lung
cancer vs. cigarett'e smoking
controversy cipshed head on in
Paris today, while a scientist
at the Karolinska Institute in
Stockholm, Sweden, described
a new way to stop the smoking.
habit.
.` At the 33rd session of the.
International Statistical' Insti-
tute, Dr. E. Cuyler Hammond,
'dizector of statistical research„
American Cancer Society„ re-
ported' finding the death, rate
of'-heavy inhalers is twice that
of non-smokers. He based' this
on a statistical analysis of
4,331 deaths during'-1IOlh months
among 382,000" men, 45 to 79
years old.
Dr. Hammond has been re-
sponsible for gathering allarge
proportion of the statistics that
purport to show a relationship
between lung cancer and smok-
ing.
Conclusion Questioned
At thee sazrae session„ Dr. Jo-
seph Berkson,'aead of biometry
and' medical statistics, Mayo
Clinic, one of' Dr. Hammond's
chflef' challengers, said it is
just as easy to prove a rela-
tionship between cancers and
marital1 status as: between lung
cancer and smoking.
"It seems' ha¢ard" us," he
said, "npt to ~ say misleading,
to infer, from statistical asso-
ciation, causal relations of par-
ticular environmental factorss
for disease by selecting, par-
ticular diseases, and with themm
particular e:.vironmental fac-
tors, that' can be made to ap-
pear reasona'-lr-"-
. Changes in death rates for
various diseases - botli' . in-
creases and'-d'ecreases-woulal
seem to be "complex resultants
of'the great decrease in death
rates that has taken place in
the younger ages during the
present century," he said. ..
'`The surviving' adult popula-
tion is, as a consequence, of a
basically d i f ferent constitu-
tional makeup from that of
former times; when the death
rates in the younger ages were
high. We should expect com,
plicated changes in the struc-
ture of the table of death rates
in the •older ages:"'
Dr. Berkson referred to a re-
cent study "by an Australian
pathologist, R. A. Willis, which
""finds that' the reported low
death rate from lung cancer
of decades ago was due to poor
diagrosis, and that there prob-
ably has meen no real increasee
of death, rate from cancer at
all."
Dr. Hammond's findings
were based on a, preliminary
analysis of the American Can-
cer Society's cancer preven-
tion study. Begun under'his
direction in October, 1959,
it involves L085,000 people in
1,121 counties in 25 states, in-
cluding Toledo and Lucas
County.
Details Requestedi
Persons in the study were
asked to fill out many i-tems' in.
a questionnaire. Those whoo
smoked were asked' to tell the,
degree they inhaled.
1'ne first annual follow-up be-
gan last October. Although he
has been able t'o make some
preliminary findings, Dr. Ham-
p!sand said, "it will'take several
years to code and' analyze all
the naaterial6"
He said "we have obtained
the death certificates fo~.. about
85 per cent of *the folliow~up.
Based on these death certifi-,
cates„ 51.71 per, cent of the
deaths among excessive -cigar-
ebte smokers were att'ributedI to,
coronary artery, disease; 1i0:8
per cent to lung cancer; 7 per
cent' to pulmonary diseases
other than lung, cancer; 3.6 per
cent to cerebral vascular le~
sions, and the remainder to° a
multiplicity of other diseases."
The death rates, he said;
were 44 per cent higher among
those who said they inhaled
ilightly compared with those
who never smoked. For those
who~ inhaled, ~ "moderately,"' it~
was 77, per cent higher.
Iniections Help
End Smoking Habit
At. the Karolinska, Institute.
Dr. Borje Ejurp gives injec-
tions of the hydrochlorides of
nicotine and lobeline, two to-
b,acco alkaloids, to patients who
wish to stop smoking: Injec-
tions are continued for-10 days,
according to a report in the
current Medical World News:
. On the first day, two or, three
injiections may be necessary.
This is because, at the start
of'treatment, it is very easy to
resume the habit. One draw
is alli that is necessary:
Crave For Candy
Sbme patients begin to get
a great' hankering for candy..
For this he provides nori-fat-
tening tablets containing a lit-
tle nicotine.
It is often necessary also to
give some 'patients heart-too-
heart psychotherapeutic talks
to prevent relapses.
At his four "tobacco with-
drawal clinics" in Stockholm,
he has treated 4,000 . cigarette
.smoker in the last fiiac years..
The abstinence rate has beer
as high as 88 per cent. This in
cludes some patients who have
smoked heavily for as long as'
30 years.
Age Not Important
He has found that the num-
ber of years of smoking or the
patient's age has been unim-
portant in determining the suc-
cess of witHdtawal..
Heavy smokers have the
greatest difficulty in abstain-
ing, because they have to make
radical changes in their way
of life.

; The New, Epidemiology
Lt;'rHAT IS NEWER is better, and indeed
L bigger and better, so that if Joseph
Berkson, of the Mayo Clinic, refers to a
"new epidemiology" it is chastening to
learn that he means an ol&amp; game called
the fallacy of misplaced concreteness. This
species of epidemiology' has come into
being through the manhandling of statis-
tics - for example;, the manhandling,that
gave rise to the incrimination of smoking
as "a cause of'lung cancer"'- and it is wcll
to take account of Berkson, who is a dis+
tinguished student of (real) statistics:
In brief, smoking, cigarettes cannot be
showni to cause any sort of cancer by
means of statistics, because it has not been
shown by the more usual biologic means
of showing things: Admittedly the latter
is more trouble. But Berkson dpals with
this fallacy in a happy, devastating foct-
note (in the Bulletin de l'7nstitut Interna-
tional de Statistique, 33E session, Paris;
1961) by quoting, de Morgan in regard to
Bacon's Novurn Orgnnum thus:
'Bacon's ruling idea was the col-
lection of enormous masses of facts
... so artistically contrived, that a
man ... without, unusual sagacity,
should be able to announce the truth
sought for.' An advantage of' the
method is that, for example, to dis-
cover the cause of cancer one is not
compelled to be possessed of' any
knowledge about the subject or to
indulge in cumbersome and some-
titnes perplexing experimentation. -
"Courage" is the name given to solving.
(or imagining one has solved) difficult
questions of etiology merely by numericali
associations; misplaced concreteness is the
mistake of identifying, some attractive as-
sociations between diseases and putative
causes; and remaining oblivious toany
number of other associations - and'a pity,
because they are often still more amusing.
Thus, what is claimed to be the relation
between smoking and lung cancer fails
to take account, of, say, the contrast be-
tween married and diworeedi people, the
married ones having a lower mortality '-','
from, lung cancer and heart disease and i~,
cancer of the stomach. The well-known it
comforts of home thus would presumably
inc:ude a meager„nonfat diet, no smoking,
and an absence of those cancer-exciting,
viruses that are "stimulated by divorce."
(But the reverse may be true, as Berkson
points out. Divorce may be caused by
viruses. )
The moral is that statistics might often
"locate suggestions" for scientists to work
on; but it is an, unfortunate delusion„suit-
able for the naive general public,,thaUthey, can assert answers to a problem not yet
enough investigated. Berkson poiitely re+
frains from supposing us as na2ve as that.

Although the cure rate has.

cer. The figures show that the
~. most progress has been made
during, the past quarter-century
against cancer of the uterus
(womb). The death rate from.
'this disease has dropped150 per •

states that with the universal

the report states, that some

are unaware of this technique.
Some 14,000 women died of

the lung cancer death rate fbr
men has Increased almost 500'

smoking cigarettes, most cases
of their lung cancer could bee

The society attributes the
progress in the over-all cure rat'e.

-he said, citing a number of'stud-
ies of such deaths froml smokers
and non-smokers.
"Every year 30;00U people die

perhaps several hundred thou-

he said - but it does lower mor- '

It does not necessarily follow
'that cigarette smokers have a,

Nevertheless, he told I an inter-

more than among women.
The data strongly, suggests that

-They also indicate that "both
these epidemics should reach
a plateau or peak within 10 to

back to 18'M, compiled with
the aid of University of Wash-

Some Ways They Died
"The reeords bear witness
that people die in many, many

Research, Buffalo„ N. Y., re+
ported sotne siarrvss in grow-
ing the suspected viruses,
found in leukPmic cPleens and
thysnuses rhtkiiaed from three
cancer patients. - • •
The viruses groNvn appeared
to resemble no knowin viruses
associated with human beings I
the researchers said.
Seventeen percent of thei
mice ihlectedi with these
viruses have developedl tumorsl
within a year; but this does
not„yet establish the viruses as
aideflnite cause of cancer, the
research team said.
Government researchers in-
cause of cancer cited' evidence
~ihdicating, that the bloor.
serum of'cancer patients lacks
an unknown substance found
in normal persons. "
Edward D: 1VicLaughlin, of
the National Cancer Institute,
Bethesda, Md., said the sub-
stance appeared to block ab
normaI cell reproduction. He
soid tests of'serum from both
normal! and cancer patients on
the liver of white rats indicate
that the cancer patient serum
may actually stimulate cell
growth, in tymors. .
Another paper indicated gall
stones may cause cancer of the
Fallbladder. Experimental find
,kngs "strongly suggest" the
possibility, the paper said.

The eminence of the doctor and of the tribunal he ad-

DOCTOR ASKS S'TATISTICIANS'
-ou~td Tobacco Be Butte~e
r.
~ake` Smoking Headt,

; By Dav
id M. Cleary •- i
Should doctors recommend that'
• tobacco be buttered before it's
smoked:
.' ' This question was asked' in
Paris last week by Dr. Joseoh
Berkson of the Mayo Clinic ir.
Rochester, Minn., speaking to
members of the International hj
stitute of Statistics.
Such a recommendation, said
the doctor, is a logical out-
growth of the purely statistical'.
studies which link butter to ~
heart disease and cigarettes
to cancer - without' any bi-
olbgical' proof of' a cause •
and - effect relationship.
Dr. Berkson used the data of
Dr: Ancel Keys of the Univer-
sity sity of Minnesota which showed
a much higher incidence of' heart
diseage in the United S t a t e s.
where butter and other fats make
up a large part of the diet; than
in Japan, where butter is a
married, people, higher among
those never married, and high-
est' of all among the divorced.
These figures are well docw
mented, having been carefully
assembled' by Insurance under-
writers for more than ]0C years.
Death rates from all causes
including cancer and' heart dis-
leese, follow the. same pattern; be-
ing lower among married' people
and highest in the divorced' atl
every age. -
"Since some authorities believe!
that cancer is caused by viruses;,
then in orc!er to accommodatee
oneself tb this theory we should,
have to postull3te a relation be-
tween viruses andi marital status;
particularly divorce. This is too
say that divorce may be causedl
by viruses or perhaps that vi-,
ruses may be stimulated by di-
vorce." he said.
. . .
TlltBIG, CHANGE ini causes
of death since 1900 is that t h e
r
advancing, • noted' Dr. Berkson:
The changes - both increases
and decreases - in causes of
Ideath among older peopie would
'seemi to be, he said, more large+
ly influenced, by the lower death
rate at younger ages than by
any other factor.
"To seize on one eiement of
these changes - the rise of the
death rate from, lung, cancer -
attach to it what appears as a
plausible explanation, and ride
bard on this explanation with+
out relating it to: o t h e r
changes: this impresses one as
the fallacy of misplaced eon+
creteness, in rather viciouss
form." he added..
As for finding, the causes of'
diseases, statisticians will make
quite a sufficient contribution if
they locate suggestions for biolo-
gist~, pathologists, biochemists
and other physicall scientists to
investigate and decide upon with
scarce commodity andl the na-ldeath rate at younger ages has~'due regard for the
tives live largely on vevetables,ldecreased and life expectaney, is!scienee, suggested! Dr.
rice, and' fish.
But incidence ^f cancer of the
stomach is far higher in Japan
than in America; Dr. B' e r k-
son pointed out, showing graphs
in which the rate of stbmach can-
cer appeared to increase w i th
advancing age in Japan just as
. heart disease does in the United
States.
r . :
"SHAfiL WE SUGG EST t h a t
while the consumption of choles-
terol - containinp, fats is increas-
ing the death rate from heart
disease it Is active to orevenf
gastric cancer?" asked the doc&lt;
tor. "Is cholesterol - cnntainingd
fat the cure of cancer?"
Referring then to the statistical
association of tobacco with lung
cancer, the speaker then suggest -
ed' the butterina of' tobacco be-
fore it is smoked.
Continuin;' to find fault with
the attempts - of statisticlans to
pinpoinf the cauaes of death
and disease on the basis of
circumstantiai' evi+lenre alone.
Dr. Berksoh presented data
shoaving, that death rates in the
United States are loweest for
facts of'
Berkson.

SALT LAKE CITY TRIbL11*TE
•Sa1t Lake City, Utah .
September-4, 1961
,ir Pollution: A Growing Utah Prohlein~
The study of air pollution problems in
Ut'aln by a, special advisory committee of
the Utah Legislative Council might welll
prove to be the most important health
,i', program undertaken in a decade.
We hope the four-man committee_will
not take its task lightly. Disturbing re-
ports on, the effects of hydrocarbons and
other air pollutants, both here and else-
where, emphasize the urgency of getting,
effective control measures under way.
THE COMMITTEE wisely intends to
examine the seriousness of' the health
threat and legal aspects, and' to determine
whether controls should be exercised at'
the state or local levels. Questionnaires
will be sent to interest'ed firms and indi-
'tiduals and a public hearing, will' be held
..September 29.
Dr. D. Wynne Thorne, director of Utah.
State University's experiment station and
co-chai'rman of the committee, has warned
of dangers from the high fluorine content
of' materials used' in the steel industry, in
brick making, and fertilizer, manufactur•
ing. And Dr. Grant S. Winn, director of in*
dustrial hygiene of the State Health De-
partment, sees pollution peril from the
prospective new beryllium refining indus-
try in Utah. Proper designing and opera-
t'ion 'of industrial plants can greatly
reduce the discharge of poisons into the
atmosphere as U.S. Steel has demon-
:- strated.
We suspect thah' not nearly enouugli
is known, about air pollution problems„
particularly along the Wasatch Front.
A continuing, research project by
trained scientists is needed. Atmospheric
rr,nditio:n.s in the Salt Lake Valley have
been compared with those of the Los An.
seles basin, where the smog, problem long
has been so aeute that pioneering, is under
way in corrective measures. We hope the .
committee avails itself of all possible in-
formation from similar committees in Los
Angeles andl other problem areas.
IN THE 1940s smoke became a major
problem in i winter in the Salt Lake Valley
and adjoining valleys, primarily because
of the use of' soft' coal. Since most heat-
ing plants in the urban area have been
converted to gas, suspicions are now di-,
rected toward' oil refineries and other in«
dtastries. Smoke is still a major problem
in Utah valley and winds carry it to arl''
jnininq areas,
One authority bel'ieves that half' to
three quarters of the air pollution in most
cities today comes from the exhaust pipes
of automobiles, trucks and buses. So far .
as we know, scientific studies have not'•definitely proved this assumption. It is
suspected, however, that the slow intake
of' gases, vapors and soot particles can bP
as fatal over a period of years as the
soupy horror of the smog of' Donora,
Pennsylvania, which killed 22 persons in..
two days in 1948.
Cigarette moki~ng is believed to eon-
tr~ti e b ~1;, cancer.
Like the pollutants from engines to-
bacco smoke contains a chemical, benz-
pyrene, which can cause cancer.
The increase in lung eancer among
men almost parallels the increase in gaso,
line consumption. In 1915 the total gaso-
line consumptibn in t'he nat'ion was aboutt
two,billion gallons. By 1955 it had climbed
to about 50 billion gallons-roughly a,
25-fold' increase. During that 40-year
period lung, cancer deaths increased' from
about one per 100,000 men per year, t'o 35
deaths-also a 25-fold jump. In the same
period cigarette smoking increased less
than threefold.
. Between 1940 and 1945, when war
rationing was in effect, U:S; doinesticc
gasoline consumption dropped about 255
p:r cent. The rate of'increase in lung, can-
cer deaths fell off t'he same percentage
during the same period. Cigarette smok-
ing greatly increased during that period..
THESE ARE MATTERS to be closely
scrutinized by the Legislative Council
commit't'ee: Air pollution is no respecter of
artificiali political boundaries. SaSt, Lake.
City long has sought to cut down, smoke
and other industrial pollution, but some
of the worst offenders are outside the cor-
porate city limits. The problem calls for
at least area eontrol~ To secure a really
effect~iweprograrn, theprestigeof'thestatee of Utah is needed, as well as adequate

Certainly, as subtiitled, this is "a

formation has been gathered from more than 6,00ID
articles published in some 1,200 journals, from at leastt
as earlw as 1770 into 1959.
Clinical chapters, arranged byanatomicat systems~
and sites, begin the volume; the primary purpose of

tent to help the reader decide if the original article

Chapter 6, on the cardiovascular system, covers sorne
~ 119 pages and' is written on two major subjects, the
~ work relating to animal studies, and that relating to,
human studies. The readers of THE HEART BuLLETTN
will be interested in this chapter. In the coverage re-
lating to human studies the section begins with "Pulse
Rate." Under this heading are: pulse rate in smokers
and' nonsmokers;, effect of smoking on heart rate; time
relations of' the pulse changes; individual variation in
response to smoking; comparative effect of smoking
on the pulse of' smokers and nonsmokers; effect of' in-
halarti„n; degree of smoking; influence of idiosyncrasy
and hypersensitivity to tobacco; influence of fasting
and food;, effect' of posture; relation of pulse rate
changes to other cardiovascular effects; effect of age;
effect of body sizec influence of sex; influence of' car-
dfoa ascular disease; effect on the pulse rate of various
forms of tobacco use; effect of "denicotinized"" or nico-
tine-free cigarettes; effect of smoking nontobacco cig-
arettes aunl of! pseudo-smoking; comparative effect of
nicotine andl smoking on heart rate;, cause of the pulse
rate increase following smoking; cardiac output; veloc

As.THOLCx most physicians are fully aware
of the disputes that exist concerning, the ef-
fects of tobacco in the human and other
species„ it is probable that few are cognizant
of the staggering extent of confusion imscien-
tific literature concerning this topic. This
monumental review of more than 6000
articles up to and largely into 1959 brings
home to the reader, the pressing need for
far more carefully designed experiments be-
fore $isall answers can be provided to many
important questions. There is little consis-
tency of data in any area of observation, and
unanimity of opinion is even more rare: Faced
with this problem in the preparation of thein
review, the authors felt that it would be
best to be "deliberately non-selective, print-
ing (as it' were ) good work and bad, sound
and uninformed opinion, alike, in the same
size type." They leave the reader to draw
his own conclusions, but they have helpedi
immeasurably by including much valid criti-
cism, and by pointing out the many pitfalls
in, interpretation. The reviewer found it very
valuable to read carefully many sections con-
cerning questions that have vexed him, and,
though being amazed by the wide disparity
of opinion, the result was a much better
understanding, and an opportunity to select
a reasonably satisfactory guide for practice.
Take, for example, the subject of' the type
of' smoking most' oftem involved, in tobacco
amblyopia. Here, as elsewhere;, there is dif-
ference of opinioni but it is hard to escape
the weight of' evidence pbinting, to the pipe
as the prime offender. No doubt many physi-
cians will be interested in the sum total of
evidence concerning tobacco and lung cancer
and they will, have thereby a better oppor-
tunity than, ever before to judge for them-
selves (free, I hope, of personal prejudice)

TO YOUR GOOD HEALTH

:` By JOSEPH G. 11AQ'1'MER, M.D.
DEAR' DR. MOLNER: Before we were
lny husband smoked cigarets one right

the other.
"Wtten we were married;

'didn't want to, but he didi
Now after a year and a half
of not smoking, he wants to
Emoke a pipe-I' know he
still craves smoking andi can
-~hardly stand it when some-
one else smokes. He even
says he Is Irritable and ner-
vous when he doesn't.
"~ "I was always afraid of
cancer of the lung. I am
~ 4tiill afraid.
` "He says smoking a pipe is
less likely to be. dangerous
as far as cancer goes. Is this
true: and what sre the
chances? I would like to be
relieved of this worry.
'
_Mrs. F. S.11
ANSWER:
Lat tts start otxt by saving
three things:
1.-D don't think tobacco
does anybody any good.
2-I have come to, accept
the fact that sotne peopiee
are just bound to worry
about, something, or other;
and if you deprive tliem of'
one worry, they soon find
another.; It's sort of' an ad-
diction.

up to them. But itts up to me
married, (and other doctors) to lmak.
sure they know that there's
a probable risk.
He Mrs. P.S., I can't tell yourr
husband not' to smoke ciga-
rets. (But YOU told him and
got away with it!)
I can say he should orr
shouldn't smoke a pipe.' The
pipe carries a 'risk; although
apparently a much lesser one.
There's a considerable and,
logical contention that.. air
pollution contributes to luilcr
cancer-but I can't tell every.
There isn't any evidence
that cigarets are the 'solee
cause of lung eanoer. People
who never have smoked'some-
times have it. 'But it Is far
more frequent among those
who do. ThaU's the story.
after.
3-I don't, know what to
do about either!
Now let me explain why I
prepounded these deep
thoughts. And let me go at
It backwards. 11 happen too
know, tthe man, a very fine
statistician, who analyzed
the first massive set of fig-
ures which led to our belief'
that cigareta have an inilu-
enee on lung cancer.
He smoked cigarets him-
self4 But' when, after several
years of collecting figures
and figuring out percentages,
It became clear that' cigarets
had some long-range influ-
ence in encouraging Iung
cancer, he quits cigarets.
Just-like-that. He now
smokes a pipe alli the time
-regardless of the fact that
he has long known, that per-
petual p i p e-sm ok i n g has
some influence in encourag-
ing cancer of the lip, tongue
or mouthl
I'm not -one to say that
people shouldn'tsmeke. That''s
counnent
° br: IViolr,er, welcomes al1l
reader mail, but regrets thaa
due to the tremendous vol-
ume received daily;, he is nn-
able to answer indiividual
letters. Reader's : questions
are incorporated in, his
column whenever possible.

There has been inucn pub-'
licity' in the national pcriodicaL-_ -;
and' newspapers regarding thC
apparent' rise in cancer In man. .`
particularly in the incidence of
f
lhng raneer. : In Ihe past, this writer has•
~attennpued to take a conserva-
tive view of such medical news
released. Many such articles
have Icd the reader to believe -'
thart an actual' inm.ea:e in the
incidence of' lung cancer is oe-;

curring dailb•.
Dr. Rupert A. Willis, author
of "Pathology of Tuniors:" re-
cently expressed his :persona!'
opinion that the apparent' 'iu-
crease in the incidencc'of car-
cinonra of the lung mayz well be
'the result of improved Tnethods
of recognition and diagnosis ra-
ther than a realiincrease in the
disease.
Dr. Willi's has studied' post=
mortem records from t'he end' of
the last century tlhrough the ear-
ly decades of the hresent and
found that leadinC padhologisti
during this t'Sine. correctly d'ial;-
'nosed as few as one in 50, or,
,even one in 100 cases.
The writer is not atitimhh,n;`'
to lull the reader into tihinlcinc~
•that Iun.c canc•er does nut eai~t
'or to th!nk that the role ar
srno, air pol0utiunt and! ur-
taant75ation may not canse sonic
iincrease in the incidence of t!je
disease - rather, that at tlhe
;present time, with the impt us-
ed methods of diagnosis and;
histologic classification t h n t
!lung cancer incidence must of
,necessity increase.

s t, *
The clinical trials are in anrl
'bhe results • are reasurring that
the measles vaccine should he
ready for general distribution
by 1962.
The vaccine will consist of;
.the attenuated live-virus and
)iuman immune globulin. In tri-
als in Philadelphia It has been:?concliisively proven that (he'
7neasles vaccine is -effect'ive in'
preventing natural measles on;
intimate exposure.

City Sentences Teen-Agers
to Lecture on 'EW,ils'
SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 7
.(AP)-Anyone under the age
of 21 caught smoking In this
city gets a ticket from the po-
lice and must either pay a fine
or attend a two-and1a-half hour
school that features movies and
a lecture on "The Evils of To-
bacco."
Strict enforcement of' this
1907 law' began several months
ago. It is debatable whether.
enforcement has heduced smok-
ing, but'it has provoked an up-
roar among the citizens.
Juvenile Judge Regnal Garff
Jr. started the intensified en-
forcement program of the state
statute that prohibits smoking
or possession of tobacco by any-
one under 21. There is a com-
panion statute making ft illegal
to give, sell or provide tobacco
to anyone under 21.
The jjadge's announcement
•created a furor in a city where
smoking is forbidden in most
public places a law that is
violated about as often as the
ban against teen smoking.
Judge uarff increased, enfor-
cement during tlae summer so
the program would be v.'eiP en-
trenched by the start of school,
when he expected a rash of vio-
lations.
Support iii Church 1Law
There is strong support for
.the, law in Mormon doctrine.
The word of' wisdom," the
code of conduct of the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, as defined bydts founder,
Joseph Smith, says:
"Tobacco is not for the body
andiis not good for man."'
Mormons make up 63 per
cent of' the state's 890,627 per-
sons and i 56' per cent of Salt
Lake County's 383,035'residents:
But Judge Garff, a Mormon,
contends the drive on smokdng
y
"is no mbral or religious lssues why you shouldi not smoke,"
It is just a, matter of education.
We want them the juveniles to
stop flouting the law."
' Only 150 tickets for smoking
were issuedn in all of 19160; most'
of' them formalities to hold
youths for questioning about
samething, else. With enforce-
ment, there were 130 smoking
tickets Itst July alone. The po-
lice issued thirty-nine 'II Au-
gust, but referred man) ~iore
to the smoking schoot.
A City Court appearance Is
necessary for violators 18, 19
and 20! But they too can attend
the smoking school in lieu of a,
first offense $10 fine.
Youths under 18 report to
Juvenile Court, and are given
a choice of attending the class
or appearing before an, official.
All have piekedi the class.
Repeat offenders pay up to A.
$10 fine. Fines are doubled for
the third violation and tripledJ
for the fourth.
The only repeaters so far, a;
20~year-o1d, was sentenced too
five days in! ja'il. After a day
the judge relented and finedl
him, $20.
Judge's Opinion
Judge Garff thinks after the
youths are exposed as smokers
"a lot of them will quit' by
themselves.
The judge thought a minute,
then added:
"Maybe we'll send' them un-
derground. But that is okay. At
least they won't be flouting au,
thority."
Judge Garff stepped, up en-
forcement because "almost all
kids at delinquency hearings
were smokers; They had the at-
titude of I'11, do what I want to
do regardless of'what the police,
parents or court want. We can't
condone violations of one law
and try to enforce others,"
Judge Garff, joined forces,

'Rohert J. Beveridge, to organize
the class materiall
"T feel rather strongly about
this, You can tell that by talk-
ing to me,',' Dr. Beveridge said.
"But I hate to see people gp
down the drain, People may not
have enouglih money for food,
but they've always got enough
for cigarettes."
Dr. Beveridge, a convert to

Certainly, as subtiitled, this is "a
aomprehensive ac-
count of the world literature" on tobacoo! The in-
formation has been gathered from more than 6,00ID
articles published in some 1,200 journals, from at leastt
as earlw as 1770 into 1959.
Clinical chapters, arranged byanatomicat systems~
and sites, begin the volume; the primary purpose of
t which~ is tb~'acquaint the reader with manifold reports
~,..: and also to present enough of their varied con-
tent to help the reader decide if the original article
~ would be helpful to his particular study.
Chapter 6, on the cardiovascular system, covers sorne
~ 119 pages and' is written on two major subjects, the
~ work relating to animal studies, and that relating to,
human studies. The readers of THE HEART BuLLETTN
will be interested in this chapter. In the coverage re-
lating to human studies the section begins with "Pulse
Rate." Under this heading are: pulse rate in smokers
and' nonsmokers;, effect of smoking on heart rate; time
relations of' the pulse changes; individual variation in
response to smoking; comparative effect of smoking
on the pulse of' smokers and nonsmokers; effect of' in-
halarti„n; degree of smoking; influence of idiosyncrasy
and hypersensitivity to tobacco; influence of fasting
and food;, effect' of posture; relation of pulse rate
changes to other cardiovascular effects; effect of age;
effect of body sizec influence of sex; influence of' car-
dfoa ascular disease; effect on the pulse rate of various
forms of tobacco use; effect of "denicotinized"" or nico-
tine-free cigarettes; effect of smoking nontobacco cig-
arettes aunl of! pseudo-smoking; comparative effect of
nicotine andl smoking on heart rate;, cause of the pulse
rate increase following smoking; cardiac output; veloc
ity of the pulse wave; myocardiall efficiency at rest andd
during exercise; and cardiac reflexes.
The work, in the final stages. was supportedl by a

of work that has been put into this volume must have
been tremendous. Everyone working in research on

As.THOLCx most physicians are fully aware
of the disputes that exist concerning, the ef-
fects of tobacco in the human and other
species„ it is probable that few are cognizant
of the staggering extent of confusion imscien-
tific literature concerning this topic. This
monumental review of more than 6000
articles up to and largely into 1959 brings
home to the reader, the pressing need for
far more carefully designed experiments be-
fore $isall answers can be provided to many
important questions. There is little consis-
tency of data in any area of observation, and
unanimity of opinion is even more rare: Faced
with this problem in the preparation of thein
review, the authors felt that it would be
best to be "deliberately non-selective, print-
ing (as it' were ) good work and bad, sound
and uninformed opinion, alike, in the same
size type." They leave the reader to draw
his own conclusions, but they have helpedi
immeasurably by including much valid criti-
cism, and by pointing out the many pitfalls
in, interpretation. The reviewer found it very
valuable to read carefully many sections con-
cerning questions that have vexed him, and,
though being amazed by the wide disparity
of opinion, the result was a much better
understanding, and an opportunity to select
a reasonably satisfactory guide for practice.
Take, for example, the subject of' the type
of' smoking most' oftem involved, in tobacco
amblyopia. Here, as elsewhere;, there is dif-
ference of opinioni but it is hard to escape
the weight of' evidence pbinting, to the pipe
as the prime offender. No doubt many physi-
cians will be interested in the sum total of
evidence concerning tobacco and lung cancer
and they will, have thereby a better oppor-
tunity than, ever before to judge for them-
selves (free, I hope, of personal prejudice)

Here, ~tmo, the experts-dental and ~

That is not the only question

question has emerged'?
' Do the doctors or the statisticians know more about
diseases and their environments?' Do the doctors or
the statzst2cians, for instance, know more about cancer
azld' its c.auses and effects?
The query rises out of criticism by an American doc-
tor, speaking before a session of the International
Statistical Institute ih~PAris; of statisticians and statistics'
which try to prove that smoking - causes lung cancer..
The eminence of the doctor and of the tribunal he ad-
dressed make his remarks exceedingly interesting.
Statistics, ignoring many other factors,, said Dr:,
Joseph Bprkson of the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, 1Ni2nn.,
"made smoking a scapegoat." Just that, periodl "A seape-
goat'!"
"To seize,'F he told the statisticians, "on one elerhent
of these secular changes-t'he rise of' the death rate of'
lung, cancer-and attach to it what appears a plausible
expianation without relating it to other noncomitant'
chahges-this impresses one as the fallacy of mispla~ed
conclusions."
And so, the question:
The Mayo Clinic doctor or the statistician, interna-

J. B. Priestley, the famous.
Bi•itish writer, thinks Amer-
ican doctors are puritanical
rather than reali'stic when
they order their male pa-
tients to stop drinking, smok-
ing and eat~ing fats.
A man who sits in an of.
five desperately trying to
outwit his competitors might
be healthier if he did not
smoke, did not drink and ate
no fats, but he wouldl be
bealthier still if he got out
of the rat race, Priestley
writes in "The New States-

Wiruse&amp; have been shown to bind together, cancer-
causiing materials _in testl tiubes. Researchers believe viruses
serve as carriers of the cancer agents, Faye Marley reports.
110 ' A FRESH APPROACH to the cancer
problem was offered to physicians attennl-
.ing the American Medical Association con-
vcntion in New York in a report limking,
cotnmon human viruses witnh, the disease.
Drs. Christopher, M. Martin, Sikmundur
Magnusson and two medical students, all
of the Seton Hall College of Medicine in
Jersey City, N. J,., reported studies in mice
tliat may possibly apply to cancers includ-
• ing leukemia (blood cancer), lynrphomas
(lympli-gland cancers) and fibrosarcomas
(connective or scar-tissue cancers).
The researchers built on previous work
-done as -early as 1944 in pioneer experi-
rttents at the Rockefeller, Institute by Drs.
Pey,ton Rous and W. F. Friedewald, and
at Yale University by the late Dr. F. Duran-
Reynals and by IvUrs: M. L. Duran-Reynals.
The investigators injected mice with
moderate doses of poliovirus type two,
with vacciniit, virus (used for smallpox
vaccination), or two viruses causing a
variety, of grippe-like diseases-Coxsackie
IB-4 and ECHO type-9-and found that they
developed no significant disease.
Mice given very small doses of either
of two cancer-causing cotnpounds-9;,ltl-
dimethyl-1~2-henzanthracene (D:vtB,a) and
2-lmino-fluorene-developed neither disease
nor tumors.
Then Dr:,lVfartin andlliis colleagues tried,
giving the same doses of one of the viruses
and one of' the carcinogens with the result
that avariety of cancers de%,clopeul in the
mice.
The nexr step was to innnnunize a groupp
nf mice against vaccinia virus, rendering,
them, highly resist.,nt to vaccinia infection..
They then compared the cffect of inry'ecting,
s•accinia virus plus DMBA into these pro-
tected mice andl into non-immunizcd niicee
stilll susceptible to vaccinia, and found that
cancers occurred only in the non-immun-
izcd, vaccinia•susceptible mice.
Dr. Martin said that lny adcling, carcino-
gens tagged with radioactive canbon-14
atotrns to solutions of highly concentrated,
purified viruses, they were able to show
that viruses hind minute yuantities, of
carcinmgens in the test tubes. The eancer=
causing virus retains the ability to invade
cells,, which the researelters h:ve inter-
preted to mean that eoinnnun viruses can
serve as carcinrngeir-cccturs or carriers, arnu
that specific innnunity against the virux Of
a carcinogen-cirus pair would protect
against the development of tuintors.
The carciniogen-vector concept, the re-
searchers believe, deserves study, in man,
ir.asmuch as it introduces the pnssibilityy
that some fornns of cancer mav loe present}
able through suppression of' the carrier cv
,
virus vaccines.

L'UN'G CANCER RATES LEVELING OFF'----------------------------------------(2:05)
There's encouraging news in a report just published in CANCER, a Journal of
the American Cancer Society. The word is that the death rate frona lung cancer
among white men under fifty-five years of age has been leveling off -- especially
in the past three years. Among, white women, the rate of increase has just about
~~ reached! its peak, and, should soon begin to show a decline. Overall, the rate of '
increase has been dropping steadily since 1930. The report is unusual' becaulse
it deals wi'th, the rate of increase, Until now, most studies have covered only the ~
total number of lung cancer, deaths reportedl, These have increasedl, partly
because the popullation has been growing, and partly because new and better
dilagno-sis tends to discover lung cancers which might not have been correctly
identified years ago. The study by scientists at the INTa:'ior.al Cancer Institute
indicates that the average rate of increalse in lung, can.:er deaths among white
mien has dropped by one half since the early 1930's. For white women, the rate
of increalse dropped to about 2 per cent i'n 1958, compared with 5-point-6 per
cent 30 years ago. Among non-whites, the rate of increase has been going down
since 1!9'50. The authors of the report cautioned' against projection of present
trends in lung cancer deaths, because there are -- as they put it -- "too many r:

Since the 16th century„when tobacco
was introduced into Europe, its use has
been a controversial matter:Rohert.
Burton in his 17th-century AnrJronry nJ'
MeVunchoLy called the tune by saying,
"Tobacco, divine; rare . . . a sovereign
remr:dy to all disease„ a virtuous herb
if it be wel[ qualified, opportunely tak-
en, and., medicinally used, but as it is
commonly abused by most men, 'tis aa
plague, a mischief'. . . . " All the sig-
nificant scientific information on this
controversial subject has been welll ex-
plored byahe keen, pharmaco~logistsat
the Medical College of Virginia. They'
have written this huge volume, com-
prising an analysis of over 6500, sci-
entific references. It is well organizedd
for reaJy reference to specific detail.
In these dans when it is increasingly
important for science to have compre-
hensive and critical reviews, this volume
on tobacco offers an interesting eKamplee
of what may he coming. Here in one
place is all' the pertinent information
available on the effects of tobacco, and'd
its alkaloids on living, materiah andl
especially on humain beings, There are
over IIt&gt;(u pages. withithree columns on
a page. for the listing of references: fulill
titles and full pagination are included.
The anal'ysis goes directly into the
problem of the absorption andl fate ot
alkahoids and other substances in tobac-
co as they are ingested, by inhalation
or by other means, into the body. Then
follows a consideration of' the effects of
tobacco and' its alkaloids on the special
senses, the nervous sy,stem, skeletal mus-
cle, blood, the cardiovascular sy,stem,
the respiratory systems the urinary tract,
the gastrointestinal tract, the oral cav-
ity; metabolism, the endocrine glands,.
are large and,l double-columned; the
material discussedl so far in this review
covers nearly 400 pages.
The authors consider the local ac-
tions of' tobacco, its detailed toxicity
and hypersensitivity, tolerance, and
habit. The immunology of' tobacco is
discussed, and there is a general survey
of the effect of smoking tobacco o&gt;} the
human orgarni'sm, as a whole. There fol-
lows a consideration of tobacco and
disease, not only from the standpoint'
of' generalities, but also with reference
to specific diseases. Consideration of
lung cancer in, relation to tobacco
smoking, is handled judiciously and fair-
ly. There is even a chapter on medical
uses of tobacco, and there are helpful
appendixes on the biological and' chem-
ical methods for the estimation of nico-
tine, as well as notes on the pharmacol-
ogy' of certain derivatives of' nicotine.
Certainly, for anyone desiring de-
tailed' information regarding the effects
of tohacco„this volume must be a prime
source: Its only failing is its lack of a
historical survey covering some 400
.
years of' accumulated writings on tobac-
co, most of which relate to various
conflicting, opinions on its merits. The
initial introduction of tobacco into
various parts of' the world has always
been as a medicine. Indeed tobaccoo
remained in most of the pharmacopeias
until the late 19th century. Neverthe-
less, by the 18th century, it was clear
that tob.,cco was usedl more for amuse-
ment than for its medicinal virtues. Its
potential dangers were well appreciated'
by the early, 1!9th eentu!ry:
Not the least of the interesting as-
pects of' tobacco has been the extensive
use of its chief alkaloid, nicotine, in the
physiological analysis of the ciompo-
nents of' the autonomic nervous system.
This was initidted' by the famed English,
physiologist, John N. Langley (1852-
1925). The authors discuss this fully
and include references to 30 of Lang-
ley,'s contributions on this important
matter.
For many years the authors of this
great compilation have been engaged
in studying various aspects of' the ef- °'
fects of smoking tobacco and of nico--V
tine. This volume, which is so well
organized and indexed, and which has
such a comprehensive bibliography, will''ll
long, remain a well appreciarted, record

Allen, in an appearance at Vir-

the nesult of'a process discovered
by a Negro slave named Stephen

mainstay for North Carolina farm-

Furthermore, its gnowth, proc-

concentrated largely in the state,

That is why, as A11en said, it
Is ?ssential to, learn the real facts
about the cause of lung, cancer.
"Our only quarrel is with those
who claim, without adequate sci=
entific supportl that tobacco use
is the cause of this or that dis-

"We not only have the right to

If the direct attack that Allen
used in his health, scare speech
Is indicative of the approach that
the Tobacco Institute is going, to
follow under his direction, it ap-
pears well for the industry.
The health scare is only one
of the problems that the industry
faces. Periodically, there are neww
seeds and new chemicals which
at first seem a boon to growers,
but when used without adequate
testing, prove a detriment.
Lessening of the stress on leaf
quality for quantity production
has been among the things that
pose a threat to U.S. flue curedl
sales abroad, where more than a,
third of North Carolina tobacco,
and that grown in surrounding,
states, is sold:
New manufacturing processess
that lump other parts of the plant
in with the leaf may possibly be-,
come another deterrent factor in
the accent on quality production.
The direct approach as exen-
plified by Allen in his speech on
the health scare situation might
well be broadened! into those and
other fields to the benefit of, the
entire industry from the growers
to the manufacturers.

Wiruse&amp; have been shown to bind together, cancer-
causiing materials _in testl tiubes. Researchers believe viruses
serve as carriers of the cancer agents, Faye Marley reports.
110 ' A FRESH APPROACH to the cancer
problem was offered to physicians attennl-
.ing the American Medical Association con-
vcntion in New York in a report limking,
cotnmon human viruses witnh, the disease.
Drs. Christopher, M. Martin, Sikmundur
Magnusson and two medical students, all
of the Seton Hall College of Medicine in
Jersey City, N. J,., reported studies in mice
tliat may possibly apply to cancers includ-
• ing leukemia (blood cancer), lynrphomas
(lympli-gland cancers) and fibrosarcomas
(connective or scar-tissue cancers).
The researchers built on previous work
-done as -early as 1944 in pioneer experi-
rttents at the Rockefeller, Institute by Drs.
Pey,ton Rous and W. F. Friedewald, and
at Yale University by the late Dr. F. Duran-
Reynals and by IvUrs: M. L. Duran-Reynals.
The investigators injected mice with
moderate doses of poliovirus type two,
with vacciniit, virus (used for smallpox
vaccination), or two viruses causing a
variety, of grippe-like diseases-Coxsackie
IB-4 and ECHO type-9-and found that they
developed no significant disease.
Mice given very small doses of either
of two cancer-causing cotnpounds-9;,ltl-
dimethyl-1~2-henzanthracene (D:vtB,a) and
2-lmino-fluorene-developed neither disease
nor tumors.
Then Dr:,lVfartin andlliis colleagues tried,
giving the same doses of one of the viruses
and one of' the carcinogens with the result
that avariety of cancers de%,clopeul in the
mice.
The nexr step was to innnnunize a groupp
nf mice against vaccinia virus, rendering,
them, highly resist.,nt to vaccinia infection..
They then compared the cffect of inry'ecting,
s•accinia virus plus DMBA into these pro-
tected mice andl into non-immunizcd niicee
stilll susceptible to vaccinia, and found that
cancers occurred only in the non-immun-
izcd, vaccinia•susceptible mice.
Dr. Martin said that lny adcling, carcino-
gens tagged with radioactive canbon-14
atotrns to solutions of highly concentrated,
purified viruses, they were able to show
that viruses hind minute yuantities, of
carcinmgens in the test tubes. The eancer=
causing virus retains the ability to invade
cells,, which the researelters h:ve inter-
preted to mean that eoinnnun viruses can
serve as carcinrngeir-cccturs or carriers, arnu
that specific innnunity against the virux Of
a carcinogen-cirus pair would protect
against the development of tuintors.
The carciniogen-vector concept, the re-
searchers believe, deserves study, in man,
ir.asmuch as it introduces the pnssibilityy
that some fornns of cancer mav loe present}
able through suppression of' the carrier cv
,

"The chief raw material used in the manufacture of_cigarette paper is
the fiber from the flax pi,ant, grown on 3.5 million acres in Minnesota, the
Dakotas, and California. It used to be that the farmer removed the flax seed
at harvest and either burned the straw or paid a.d'ollar andialhalf an acre to
king size cigarettes to supply the market for exactly four and two thirds seconds.
More than 1 and 114 billion cigarettes are sold every 24 hours.
"But not all people like cigarettes wrapped'in paper which is pure white,

the fibers are washed, bleached, and beaten into a snowy-white pulp. This is
pumped through a series of steam-heated drying rollers. At the erid,,the paper
is wound on 4000 pound rolls. This in turn is to cut into one inch bobbins or
reels weighing eight and one half pounds. One reel will wrap 7;W,000 king size

Buyers swarm over the farm lands inspecting and bidding. Some of'them travel by

the spot. Some of'the companies have gotten to the point where they move big
portable plants into the field and work day and night processing the fiber which
cart it away. Now that straw is worth about $3 million a year in farm income.
What's more, there's active and'intense competition among,the cigarette paper

The health scare is only one
of the problems that the industry
faces. Periodically, there are neww
seeds and new chemicals which
at first seem a boon to growers,
but when used without adequate
testing, prove a detriment.
Lessening of the stress on leaf
quality for quantity production
has been among the things that
pose a threat to U.S. flue curedl

states, is sold:

that lump other parts of the plant
in with the leaf may possibly be-,

the accent on quality production.
The direct approach as exen-
plified by Allen in his speech on
the health scare situation might
well be broadened! into those and
other fields to the benefit of, the
entire industry from the growers

They base their findings on a

men, and women, old and young,
about their smoking habits and
how they felt', about cancer. They
also studied results of similar sur-
__yeys and the increase in cigarette

in 1953 and 1954.

they apparently were."
No Relationship
: The survey, the researchers
point' out, did not show, any defi-
nite relationship between smok-
- ing habFts and' thoughts about'
cancer among women.
While women smokers were
more skeptical about dying from
cancer than women nonsmokers,
they found, this may have been
only because the female smokers
were younger. Also, women who
do smoke, they learned; generally
smoke less than merr smokers
and are apt to use filter tips.
"Smoking seems to be a~ rela-
tively superficial habit among
women and tends to be socially
conditioned, rather than an ex-
pression of 'deeper' personality
characteristics or attitudes," the
researchers concluded.
Among men smokers, however,
they found a tendency to be skep-
tical about the heavy smoker's
chances of' getting, cancer being
greater than that of the light
smoker.

"and doctors should cooperate in educating,

smoking by never forming the habit," the

An AMA official explained the statement
was made primarily in • support of including
smoking,educat'ion in school health andlhygiene
classes. He said that such education probably_
would' be aimed at 10 to '12 year olds since,
•he said, many children begin smoking as early
as ages 12 or 13.

added, ';'should take the form of'a thorough ex-

on physical and emotional' health." The com-
mittee did not specifically.mention any of whatt
they termed! to be deleterious effects of to-
bacco: Medical researchers have suggested,
In recent years that cigaret smoking may be
a cause, of lung, cancer and that smoking, may
effect the heart and blood vessels. These
theorries:.though are controversial:•

be publicized in professional medioall and' edu-

for doctors and laymen by the medical ergani-

The Tobacco Institute, representing the to-

The joirlt' committee also called for the

told a reporter there was a
"real possibility that g r e a t
strides will soon be made in
the efforts to conquer cancer."
"Bat,"' Dr. Terry said, "when

there is one thing I mustpolet
ont. I do not mean that we will
wake up some morning and

"It will' be a gradual process,
little by little. There are so
very many different kinds of

Four specialigts in lung dis-

Academy of General Practice.
And their answers variedi.
"I don't believe smokiag' Is a

It may irritate a cancer that'

Dr. J. Winthrop ~ Peabody, Jt.,
of Georgetowa, University,

some X-rays in an effort to
demonstrate that lung cancer
can often be mistaken for
other diseases. HG showed' one
series of X-rays and said:

A middle-of-tlie -road position
was taken by Dr. Charles E.

WASHINGTON - Scientists
are finding more evidence that
` the reported rise ini lung cancer

The publication, issued by The
Tobacco Instiute, Inc., sum-

to questions raised concerning
-tobacco use and human health.
The current i'ssue includes ar-
ticles on reports of the relation-

article reports on, a-- study by
Drs. Broda 0. Barnes of Denver,

Graz, Austria.
"Our data indicate that a large
increase in bronchogenic (lung)
cancer can be expected as t h e

The continuing sear&amp; for the cause of Iyng'

Increase in lung cancer may be due in part to the
happy decrease in deaths from tuberculosis.
As iA the case made against cigarets, there is
quite i body of statistical evidence to support this
'
belief, as welll as some pakhological evidence. Scars
in lungs from old tuberculbsis lesions: it has been
reported, seem to serve in time as literal "seed
beds" for carcinogenous growths. Staitistically~ t~here
is ample evidence, of course. of fewer deaths from
tuberculosis. Better diagnwsis anrl tlreatmcnt mranF
that many who a fe%a- decddbs ago would have died
of tuberculosis are now liviitg, into ages where
cancer becomes more common. Still' unanswered
by this theory as well as byy others is the "why?"
of lung cancer.
Still pursued hy researchers-along with hun-
dreds of other trails-is the belief that air pnllu-
tions„ particularly from~ automobile exhausts and
industiial gases, are causitive factors in lung ean:

to this belief. Research there has shown that
native born persons of English stock, despite smok-

in lungs from old tuberculbsis lesions: it has been
reported, seem to serve in time as literal "seed
beds" for carcinogenous growths. Staitistically~ t~here
is ample evidence, of course. of fewer deaths from
tuberculosis. Better diagnwsis anrl tlreatmcnt mranF
that many who a fe%a- decddbs ago would have died
of tuberculosis are now liviitg, into ages where
cancer becomes more common. Still' unanswered
by this theory as well as byy others is the "why?"
of lung cancer.
Still pursued hy researchers-along with hun-
dreds of other trails-is the belief that air pnllu-
tions„ particularly from~ automobile exhausts and
industiial gases, are causitive factors in lung ean:
cer. South African studies have helped lend weight
to this belief. Research there has shown that
native born persons of English stock, despite smok-
ing more heavily, have a lower incidence of lung
cancer t'han, is found back in Britain.
Conflicting, reports and theories add to, an a1: '
ready great confusion of' course. But they hold
encouragemcnt„ too, in their esntinuing dentonstra-
tion that so many lines of inquiry are being ex-
ploredl
Such, research is not as exciiting, or adventurous
as the currently glorified exploration of space. Btun
the answers which everuttially will be found are or,
nxuch greater importance to mankind.

The health scare is only one
of the problems that the industry
faces. Periodically, there are neww
seeds and new chemicals which
at first seem a boon to growers,
but when used without adequate
testing, prove a detriment.
Lessening of the stress on leaf
quality for quantity production
has been among the things that
pose a threat to U.S. flue curedl
sales abroad, where more than a,
third of North Carolina tobacco,
and that grown in surrounding,
states, is sold:
New manufacturing processess
that lump other parts of the plant
in with the leaf may possibly be-,
come another deterrent factor in
the accent on quality production.
The direct approach as exen-
plified by Allen in his speech on
the health scare situation might
well be broadened! into those and
other fields to the benefit of, the
entire industry from the growers
to the manufacturers.

Ma:y 4, 1961
WASHINGTON - Scientists
are finding more evidence that
` the reported rise ini lung cancer
may be due in part to the de-
crease in deaths from tubercu-
losis, it was reported today in the
publication, Tobacco and Health.
The publication, issued by The
Tobacco Instiute, Inc., sum-
niarizes recent research relevant'
to questions raised concerning
-tobacco use and human health.
The current i'ssue includes ar-
ticles on reports of the relation-
ahip between heart disease and
stress andl strainj research re-
sults, and environmental factors
that may be involvedi in lung can-'
'cer:
One article says that since
the development of modern
methods of treatment, "patients
, with i tuberculosis are living longg
enough to develop eancer "' The
article reports on, a-- study by
Drs. Broda 0. Barnes of Denver,
Golo:, and Max Ratzenhofer of
Graz, Austria.
"Our data indicate that a large
increase in bronchogenic (lung)
cancer can be expected as t h e
death rate from t'ubercudosis de-
creases," they wrot'e.
Autopsies
Their, findings were based on
a study of marre than 26,000
autbpsies at the Pathological In-
stitvte of the Universit'y of Graz,
and' were f'i r s t outlined in the
Journal of the American Medical
Association.
Another report cited said' that
lung cancers often arise inn
bronchial scars left' by tubercu-
losis. T h e y appear mostly in
"scars some decades old,"' accorrl«
ing to Dr. Philip Schwartz, d"urec-

°Evsry, pperson living in coun-
tries in which pulmonary cancer
frequently occurs , may be con-
sidered contaminated by tubercu-
losis up to the age.of'30 at the
latest," said Dr. Schwartz. This
process, he said, sets the stage
for lung cancer to develop in the
tubercular scars in later years.
His findings appeared earlier in

Lisf en. You're More Emofiona'il„
, Drink More Than Nonpuf f ers
LONDON, May 25,-(AP)--A British psy-
chiatrist came up today with a new theory
about smokers: They are more emotional than
nonsmokers, more neurotic, aill more, drink
more, drive more dangerously and get divorced
more often. Also, they are more sociable.

PROPOUNDING his theories in the British
Nfedical Association magazine, Prof. H. J.
Eysenck of' London University said smokers
also suffer from more anxieties, get more
.worked up; and go to the hospital more fre,
quently. In addition, they tend to live at a higher
rate n than nonsmoking citizens, which, in turn
produces more neuroses and stimulates the need'
for yet more nicotine and alcohol.
,`;~ '
~ Professor Eysenck said he i's quite certain
that cf a et smoking increases the chance of'.
~. lung cancer but said he was uncertain which
comes first -the snaoking, or the predisposition
to cancer. .
He suggested that deep down the smoker
may be unconsciously aware he is doomed. So
he lives It up, drinks, smokes, changes his wife

Lisf en. You're More Emofiona'il„
, Drink More Than Nonpuf f ers
LONDON, May 25,-(AP)--A British psy-
chiatrist came up today with a new theory
about smokers: They are more emotional than
nonsmokers, more neurotic, aill more, drink
more, drive more dangerously and get divorced
more often. Also, they are more sociable.

PROPOUNDING his theories in the British
Nfedical Association magazine, Prof. H. J.
Eysenck of' London University said smokers
also suffer from more anxieties, get more
.worked up; and go to the hospital more fre,
quently. In addition, they tend to live at a higher
rate n than nonsmoking citizens, which, in turn
produces more neuroses and stimulates the need'
for yet more nicotine and alcohol.
,`;~ '
~ Professor Eysenck said he i's quite certain
that cf a et smoking increases the chance of'.
~. lung cancer but said he was uncertain which
comes first -the snaoking, or the predisposition
to cancer. .
He suggested that deep down the smoker
may be unconsciously aware he is doomed. So
he lives It up, drinks, smokes, changes his wife
and in so doing,cuts down his chances of'sur-
vival.
:' Professor Eysenck said his opinions, basedl
on experiments, do not rule out the old theory
that smoking causes cancer. He argued that
both theories could be true-the smoking stokes

able to ward' it off.

NIMBLE VETERANS OF' '98 ' PROVIDE AGING CLUES
THE 'Spanish-Ameriiean War veterans of'11+Lassacliusetts-134 men whose
ages range from 72' to 92-have furnished a new surprise in the field
of aging.
They first surpid'sed the Veterans Administration by being so re-
markably long-lived and' so young andi healthy for their years. VA
doctors in Boston are studying them in hope they willl furnish clues to,
helping other oldsters.
. The physicians had speculated that since the veterans had, neither
an, easy environment nor modern medical care in, earlier years, their,
healthi and ]bngevity might be due to constitutional makeup.
Not so; say Drs. Olfiver J. Harris and James F. Cummins of the
Boston VA out-patient cli^ic. Instead, of being, tall and lean, as ha&amp; been
exper_tea, most of the veterans are shorter and rounder-of just the
type of body build that furnishes the likely candidate for coronary heart
disease at a rather young age.
Nor did these senior citflzens seem to have worried much about
keeping their weight down after they reached' 50. "Contrary to expecta-
tions, one-third reached their highest weight past 70 years, andl one-half
past 55 years,"'the two doctors reported. The veterans' average age is 82.
Not one of the 134 has developed cancer of the lungs; although 25'
(continue to be heavy smokers and 51 were heavy smokers in the past.I
.
All are remarkably healthy both physically and' mentally, appear to
be practically free from accident-proneness, and have been relatively
free from any damaging effects of degenerative vascular disease.
Twenty-three have never had a serious illness.
Doctors Harris andl Cummins said they willl extend their study to
include veterans of both world wars and the Korean conflict-a cross
section of the male population from ages 29 to 70. The Boston VA
clinic intends to study them throughout their lifetimes, as Is being done
for the Spanish-American War veteran,
"It is our hope that in, this way, norms for various age groups may
be established, and' clues to degenerative diseases may be larealed; '
said' the two physicians.

that smoking is a major contrib-

there is now conclusive evi-

NIMBLE VETERANS OF' '98 ' PROVIDE AGING CLUES
THE 'Spanish-Ameriiean War veterans of'11+Lassacliusetts-134 men whose
ages range from 72' to 92-have furnished a new surprise in the field
of aging.
They first surpid'sed the Veterans Administration by being so re-
markably long-lived and' so young andi healthy for their years. VA
doctors in Boston are studying them in hope they willl furnish clues to,
helping other oldsters.
. The physicians had speculated that since the veterans had, neither
an, easy environment nor modern medical care in, earlier years, their,
healthi and ]bngevity might be due to constitutional makeup.
Not so; say Drs. Olfiver J. Harris and James F. Cummins of the
Boston VA out-patient cli^ic. Instead, of being, tall and lean, as ha&amp; been
exper_tea, most of the veterans are shorter and rounder-of just the
type of body build that furnishes the likely candidate for coronary heart
disease at a rather young age.
Nor did these senior citflzens seem to have worried much about
keeping their weight down after they reached' 50. "Contrary to expecta-
tions, one-third reached their highest weight past 70 years, andl one-half
past 55 years,"'the two doctors reported. The veterans' average age is 82.
Not one of the 134 has developed cancer of the lungs; although 25'
(continue to be heavy smokers and 51 were heavy smokers in the past.I
.
All are remarkably healthy both physically and' mentally, appear to
be practically free from accident-proneness, and have been relatively
free from any damaging effects of degenerative vascular disease.
Twenty-three have never had a serious illness.
Doctors Harris andl Cummins said they willl extend their study to
include veterans of both world wars and the Korean conflict-a cross
section of the male population from ages 29 to 70. The Boston VA
clinic intends to study them throughout their lifetimes, as Is being done
for the Spanish-American War veteran,
"It is our hope that in, this way, norms for various age groups may
be established, and' clues to degenerative diseases may be larealed; '
said' the two physicians.

The current' Issue of Tobacco
News says there are an estimated
17 million ericans dependent on
tobacco for art or a11' of their Hwli:

The news is published by the To-
•bacra Institute, Inc.
In an article by Tobacco News
entittled' "Tobacco Creates Jobs for,
Millions," It says that "in between
the farmers who grow the tobacco
and mi111ons who purchase tbe pro-
ducts, a great, variety of materials,
skills, services and sciences are
needed."
~•.. Piotures of people working In the
many occupations; picked from the
thousands of firms that supply
goods and services to the industry
are shown in the publication.
~ The occupations cited in the ar-
'title are the 111iidivesterr? farmer

and cellophane workers; prinw-
ers, ink manufacturers, advertis-
ing men, vending machines and
servicemen.
The growth of the tobacco indus-
try "has created a chain of emplcly-
ment for millions of, people, includ-
ing the tax collectors who take al-
most $3 ' billion yearly in direct ex-
cise taxes," says Tobacco News.
Retatl' sales of tobacco produots
were about $7 bl last year.
. Direct tobacco employment in-
cludes the 7S0yo0o farm families
who grow tobacco, employees of the
tobacco manufacturers, some 7,000

The current' Issue of Tobacco
News says there are an estimated
17 million ericans dependent on
tobacco for art or a11' of their Hwli:

hood.
The news is published by the To-
•bacra Institute, Inc.
In an article by Tobacco News
entittled' "Tobacco Creates Jobs for,
Millions," It says that "in between
the farmers who grow the tobacco
and mi111ons who purchase tbe pro-
ducts, a great, variety of materials,
skills, services and sciences are
needed."
~•.. Piotures of people working In the
many occupations; picked from the
thousands of firms that supply
goods and services to the industry
are shown in the publication.
~ The occupations cited in the ar-
'title are the 111iidivesterr? farmer
+who grows flax for cigarette paper;
tactory worker,s who build machin-
'ery and electronic devices and con-
vert mtlkland starch Into adhesiw e
:`ior" cigarette paper; a:urminu2n
and cellophane workers; prinw-
ers, ink manufacturers, advertis-
ing men, vending machines and
servicemen.
The growth of the tobacco indus-
try "has created a chain of emplcly-
ment for millions of, people, includ-
ing the tax collectors who take al-
most $3 ' billion yearly in direct ex-
cise taxes," says Tobacco News.
Retatl' sales of tobacco produots
were about $7 bl last year.
. Direct tobacco employment in-
cludes the 7S0yo0o farm families
who grow tobacco, employees of the
tobacco manufacturers, some 7,000
. distributing firms and 1.5 million i
ret'®II outlet3.

After studying the trend of the lung,

r.eport:
There has been a steady decline ini.th$
rate of increase in lung cancer deaths since

has dropped by one-half since the early
l930's. Among white women it' has
dropped from 5.6 percent' 3o years ago to
approximately two percent in 1958.
Among non-whites the annual rate of In-
crease has beeri dropped since 1195,0.
.
The scientists also made some hopeful
predictions. If the downward trend con-
tinues, they said, lung cancer among the
white male population "will reach a peak
in the foreseeable future and then start to
decline". Among, .white womeny the rate
of Increase has already about reached its
peak and should begin to show a decline..

Danger of Can
Found k Viruses
Carrying Chemicals
By MILDRED SPENCER
Buffalo Neaai Stalf Reporter
NEW YORK, June z9+-Vinis
missiles, loaded with a chemical
warhead, may penetrate eelis to
cause some forms of cancer, a
team of New Jersey researchers
suggested to the American Med.
Ica1 Association today. .
Dr. Christopher M. Martin re-
ported studies in Seton Hall Col-
lege of Medicine have shown
that viruses which do not cause
cancer themselves still can trig-
ger the cancer process in~ mice.
They do so, he explained, by
picking up; a load of somee
cancer-causing chemical and
carrying It through the cell
walls, which they penetrate
easily„ into the cell' itself.
The New Jersey team used as
missiles the viruses that cause
grippe-like diseases, cowpox or
vaccinia and one type of polio.
Prevention Might' Be Possible
Viruses migltt' be "vectors" or
carriers; they reasoned, just as
mosquitoes are victors of ma-
laria. The germi that causes
malaria enters the body through
a mosquito bite.
Ifi eancer-causing chemicals in.
air pollutants, industrial wastes
and, certain foods could not get
into the cells without riding, on a&amp;
virus, it might be possible to
prevent the cancers they now
cause by developing vaccines to
.suppress the viruses.
This is how public health work-
r-rs have attacked malaria-by
wiping out the mosquitoes that
carry the germ.,
Develop Variety of Cancers .
w;thout virus carriers. nnh,
large amounts of concer-causing
chemicalfr will cause cancers in
mice, Dr. Martin said. Mice in+
jected with moderate doses of
two such chemicals developed no
cancers, he added.
Mice injected with the viruses
alone did not develop cancers
either. But; when they gpt the
same doses of one of'the chem-
icals and one of the viruses,
they developed a variety of,
cancers:
The investigators then Im•
munized some of their experi-
mental mice against vaccinia
virus. When the immunized!
,mice were In9ected with the ~.
chemical-loaded virus, they de-
veloped no cancers. Bdon+im-
.munized' mice which received
similar doses got cancers;,

': 'rxs't.utac ent'vcEa alarm has sounded again.
7Tte tiresome feature about these official
reports and pronouncements is their ten-
dency to assume that smoking has been
proved to cause lung cancer. It has not,.
' Again+, they always seem to addt i a warning
about bringing home the dangers of smoking
to young people. As long as these dangers
remain unprovedjit' is misguided to spend
Jttuch time 'bringing them h'ome to a class
of'people who are unlikely to be deterred
by a whiff of danger..
An announcement in the latest' British
Medical Journal reads:'
The high death rate from i lung cancer
among men is emphasised intheReportojn the Depanment of Health for Scotland: 1!%0,
Pt1(HMS©, 5s). It is described as 'a serious
andgrowingprob'lem ofpub'lic health', and
the number of deaths (2,422 for, both sexes)
was more than twice what it was ten ycars
ago. The report notes the difficulty of
bringing homcto youngg peopiee an under- -
. standingof the risks of cigatenesmokinge against 'the high pressure salesmanshipp
directed to thee opposite viewpoint'..
Public health campaigns should not be'
based on conjecture and scare-mongering.
This particular hare was started eleven yearss
ago when Dr Bradford Hill;,eminent fellow
of the, Royal Statistical Society, published
his findings showing that lung cancer was
commonest among, heavy smokers. This
association of disease and' smoking was
striking,, but neither this nor subsequent
surveys,have demonstrated one as the cause
of the other.
One finding , of the first survey was' th'at •
C among smokers lung cancer was commoner
in those who did not' inhale thaw in those
who didl, For those who argue a casual
connection fronr an association, it, is as
reasonable to try and persuade persistent
smokers to inhale, as it is to persuade the
oth'ersto give it up,alfogethen Unfortunately,
~ in his next survey on the smoking habits of
40,000 doctors, Dr Bradford Hill did not
include the question 'Do you inhale?' If he
had done, there miglit be as many people
arguing 'Inbale' as there are now saying
'Don't smokel"
This was one of the many aspects of the
problem pointed ouY by Sir Ronald Fisher,
another eminent' fellow of the Royal
Statisticall Society, in the pamphlet• pub-
lished!in 1959. He suggested that lung cancer
(or a preeancerous condition which may'
have existed for many years) rnight' be res-
ponsibie for a desire to smoke, or again
that a common factor„ the individual geno-.
type; might be responsible for both the
disease and the desire to smoke.'Ihe prob-
lem is vast, complieated. largely uncharted
and still' unsolved. Surveys have brought'
out many faets, including the lower in-
cidence of the disease in women. cigar andl
pipe smokers and country dwellers. "I4tat
p er s o n a l li t y differences in lung-cancer
patients do exist as compared with control
subjects has been shown in the latest issue
of the British Medical'lournal. Dr Kissen,
of the Glasgow University Dapartment' of.
PsyFhviogical Medicine, and Professor H I
Eysenk, of'the .'aaudtley'Hospital, London,
quote figures showing,tha: the incidence of
neurotic illness is much less in~ lut:e-cancer
patients.
Continuing research is necessary, scare-
mongering is not.,At present'there is much
evidence, but no proof. Since frightening
propaganda is usually ineffective andiun-
jusufiable in the absence of proof, it should
be discouraged.
Fisher's comments are still valid. He dts-
cribes the rational attitude of the man who
scents danger, either infinitesimal or serious,
and l decides to give up smoking-a habit
• Sir Ronald AFlsher:S9noking. 'ilu.CancerControvcnsy. 1959. Olitrr and Bovd: 2s 6d.'
which may not be,very important whim-
as a kind of insurance against a danger
which he is quite unable to assess. He con-
trasts this with the attitude of the propa•
gandist, who aims 'to plant fear in, the a»nds
of perhaps a hundred million smokers
throughout the world-to plant' itwith the
aid of all the means of, modern publicity
backed by public money, without knowingg
for certain that they have anything to be
afraidl of' in the particular habit againstt
which the propaganda is to be directed ...
The habit is an insidious one, diffcult to
break, and consequently in many, many,
cases there would be implanted what a
psychologist might recognise as a grave
conflict'.
He goes on to say: 'Before one interfcress
with the peace of mind and habits of others
it seems to mrthat the scientific evidence-
the exact weight of the evidence free from
emotion-should, be rather carefully ex-
amined.' One consolation to those of' us
whose neurotic anxiety is stirred up by, this
controversy is that, if figures are a guide,
anxiety, may be -n indication of safety, just
as inhalation may help reduce the danger.

"I don't believe smoking Is a

It may irritate a cancer that has

Dr. Julius L. Wilson, director of
education for the American
Thoracic Society and professor
ofi preventive medicine, at the
University of Pennsylvania's
Henry Phipps Institute.
"And I' have no use for the sta-
tisticai studies which attempt to
show a relationship of Iung, can•

of tobacco over the years," said'
Dr. Wilson. He is a non-smoker.
Another speaker, Dr. JL Win-
throp Peabody Jr. of Ceorgetowm,
University in Washington, D. C.
presented a series of 60 Ianterni
slides, many of them x-rays, show-
ing, that' lung cancer can often be:
mistaken for other diseases of the
lungs, and' vice versa.
. . .
AT ONE TIlVIE he showed a
series of four, x-rays, and said:
"I defy anyone in the audience
to tell me which of these is can-
cer:"
From later operations, it' was
determined' that only me of' the
four lesions under suspicion was a
P.ancer, the doctor then revealed.
The other three were nodules in
the lungs which were not malig-
nant, and could just as well have
been Ieft' alone.
"Yet' we have no good test to
prove conclusively that a lesion
of this type is not a cancer, so.
Ne fee1, that we are justified in,
doing lung surgery in many of
these cases," said Dr. Peabody.
There are certain exceptions, in
which the presence of calcium
,cleariy shows the Iesion to be
oon-malignant, but this can be
very difficult to determine tlirough

establishes b e y o n d any
reasonable d'o u b t that
cigaret smoking is a causa-
t'ive factor in the rapidly
increasing incidence of
human epidermoid cancer `
of the lung,"
The British Medicali Rer
search Council has agreedd
that cigaret smoking is aa
major cause of'ltrng cancer
and the. National Cancer
Institute of Canada, hass
concluded that smokers.
"have a greater risk of
dying of lung cancer and
the risk increases with the-
amount smoked."
Dr. Delarue says he
accepts these conclusions
and gives the following
advice to smokers:
• Cigaret smoking should
be discouraged~
•1 The facts should be
underiined' that it is never,
too late.to stop;,
• If' people must smoke
cigarets, then they should
use filter tips and discard
the cigaret when it' is still
only half smoked!
Smoking, doesn't' just
cause lung cancer, he
emphasizes, with all the
experience of a surgeon
who spends most of his
working day examining
people who come to him
with, worries about, their
chests. It also leads to
chronic bronchitis, wheez-
ing cough, shortness of
breath and many other dis-
tzessing ailments.

Cancer Institute- offers a qualified•
word of reassurance; A spokesman
for the institute told the annual
meeting of the' Medical Society of
New Jersey that cigaret smoking
plays a role, but not the major one,
in lung~ cancer.
Dr. Wilhelm C. Hueper said' that
throughout the world lung cancer is
much, more prevalent In industriali
tPan, in rural areas, a difference be
attributed not' to •3noking, but to air
pollution,
If this Is moderately consoling, to
the cigaret smoker, it is bad nevs.
for everyone else: Ai the meeting,.
Dr. Frank L. Rosen of Maplewood,,
an allergist, described' air pollu-
tion as &amp; 1naDor, threat to health ,
and urged adoption of federal con-
trol lQLws operating across state
~ boundaries end • a tenfold increase
in research funds.
Public health, authorities have
long been worried about air:pollu-
tion and Its consequences, but the
public has not become enough'
alarmed to Insist on vigorous meas-
ures: Efforts' to combat the evili

and 15 in rural sections.
In Montana, Dr. Hueper sa[d,
the rate is 48.6 in copper smelt-

The doctor called for research
to pinpoint what kindf of exposure
to air pollution causes the disease:.
In another talk'at the same ses+
siona Dr. Frank L Rosen of Mgple:
wood, chairman of the mete+
orology committee of th¢, Ameri-

problem requires federal law, uni-

He termed air pollution a major
modern threat to health.
"The air tt a great open

Itr the sia-aa&amp;a-hadf' years• that the Scientific advssory
board' to the . T~o accoindtxstry research committee has been
directing tha indust'ry-ftsearch program on tobacco andl health,:
thisgzoup of experienced doctors and scientists has recom-
menal+sd grants-iff-aid to more,than 100 scientists in~ about 70.
medical schools and other .research instibutions. A11 of these
recommended grants have been made by the. TIRC withoat
question, and which, together with funds appropriated for -1981 f
total $4,f&amp;50,0@0.
But the relationship, betweem the cigarette and'i lung can-
,.,
cer-if there is one-still remains a medical mystery.
"Perhaps the most sig,pific.wt development;" says the board~,
1!
in a recent report, "has been the general recognition that we dio,,
not yet have the answers; that an association between the ex-;
tent of tobacco use and the fncidence of lung cancer does not-
prove a causal relationship; that exlaerimental verification} is`•
essential; and that there are a number of odaer factors which
.
need to be conrideredl
"We are not satisfied," the report continues, "to let thet'
problem rest with statistical reports suggestiag`that' heavy smok-
jng, increases the risk of cancer of the lung; we are interested ;
also in knowing why the overwhelming majority of heavy smok.;
ers do not contract the disease despite their smoking."
I
In~ the further pursuit of scientifically satisfactory answers
to these elusive questions, the board urges further and broader;
research im 22 specific areas. Dr. Clarence Cook Little, scien-l'
tific director of TIRC, whose annual Aport includes the board's
statement, observes frankly that, "a simple answer to .what are °
not simple questaons is unlikeliy in the near ftrture",,
"The important thing," says Dr. Little, "is to keep• on adding
to knowledge until the accumulative facts provide tho basis'for
a sound concliision."

LUNG CANCER RATES LEVELING OFF'-----__-------------------------------;.-(,2~05)
There's encouraging news in a report just published in CANiCER, a journal of -_
the American Cancer Society. The word is that the death rate frorm, lung cancer
among white men under fifty-five years of age lias been leveling off - especially
in the past three yzax . Among white women, the rate of increase has just about
reached its peak, an? should! soon begin to show a decline. Overal'l, the rate of
i~ncreasehasbeen dlroppingst'ea~diily si'nce1'930,Thereport is unusual because
it deals with the rate of' increase. Until now, most studies have covered' only the
total number of lung cancer deaths reported
These h
i
.
ave
ncreased, partly
~ because the population hals been growing,, and partly because new and better
C1p diagnosis tends to discover lung cancers which, might not have been correctly
~ identifiedl years ago. The study by scientists at the National Cancer Institute
\ indicates that the average rate ofirncrease in lung cancer deaths among white
6~3- men has dropped by one hallf' since the early 19301's. For white women, the rate
111~ ofi'ncrease dropped to about 2' per cent in 1958„ compared with 5-point-6 per
I
X~ cent 30' years ago. Among, non-vwhites, the rate of increase has been going down
~xN since 1950. The authors of the report cautioned against projection of present
Q trends in lung, cancer deaths, because there are -- as they put it -- "'t'oo many
~ unknowns surrounding the nature and magnitude of't11e forces responsible for the
\ recorded increase in lung cancer mortalit'y.. .Not the lealst' of'these unknowns is
the question of how much of the recordedl increase is genuine and how much is

LUNG CANCER RATES LEVELING OFF'-----__-------------------------------;.-(,2~05)
There's encouraging news in a report just published in CANiCER, a journal of -_
the American Cancer Society. The word is that the death rate frorm, lung cancer
among white men under fifty-five years of age lias been leveling off - especially
in the past three yzax . Among white women, the rate of increase has just about
reached its peak, an? should! soon begin to show a decline. Overal'l, the rate of
i~ncreasehasbeen dlroppingst'ea~diily si'nce1'930,Thereport is unusual because
it deals with the rate of' increase. Until now, most studies have covered' only the
total number of lung cancer deaths reported
These h
i
.
ave
ncreased, partly
~ because the population hals been growing,, and partly because new and better
C1p diagnosis tends to discover lung cancers which, might not have been correctly
~ identifiedl years ago. The study by scientists at the National Cancer Institute
\ indicates that the average rate ofirncrease in lung cancer deaths among white
6~3- men has dropped by one hallf' since the early 19301's. For white women, the rate
111~ ofi'ncrease dropped to about 2' per cent in 1958„ compared with 5-point-6 per
I
X~ cent 30' years ago. Among, non-vwhites, the rate of increase has been going down
~xN since 1950. The authors of the report cautioned against projection of present
Q trends in lung, cancer deaths, because there are -- as they put it -- "'t'oo many
~ unknowns surrounding the nature and magnitude of't11e forces responsible for the
\ recorded increase in lung cancer mortalit'y.. .Not the lealst' of'these unknowns is
the question of how much of the recordedl increase is genuine and how much is
artifact. "'

'recipitants in Coronary Di~sease
I ' IN THE LAST ISSUE Of CFrCuliltitoR`can
be found one of' the most exasperating of
i articles about emotional factors in coro.
nary disease - or so many will find it. On
the hypothesis that exasperation is secretly
j.beneficial (when it does not precipitate
; coronary disease), we will summarize it
in part as follows: griefs and disasters are
not really to blame for the coronary occlu-
sions that follow them - other influences
come into play.
The author describes no fewer thanfour
patients who in the course of their hard-
driving, hard4moking, business anxieties
tmanaged to achieve a myocardial infarc-
`tion, and recovered, and then - then their
troubles really began. There were deaths
in the family, ruinous reverses in business,
horses that lost, nagging wives, and most-
of the tribulations of I Job; but not one of
the patients developed' another ocglusion.
°d"`'1cThus, an example can be found off
nearly anything you might imagine: even
four examples. By the same token, the
patient' with lung cancer who doesn't
smoke and never didisrnoke, whom, every-
one sees now and then, ought to abolish
the supposed connection between ciga-
rettes and cancer. Why, it's a paradox!'
It is nothing,of'the sort, but it is enter.
taining and perhaps instructive.
There is an important relation between
the troubles people have and their coro-
nary disease (much as there is a, connec-
tion of' some sort between smoking and
lung cancer), but only a singularly brave
man would venture to explain what the
connection is. T7ie role of diet' and fats
may be accountedI for with even more con-.
fidence, when perhaps it deserves less.
A wholesome doubt is therefore re-
freshing and salutary: as long,as we do not
possess the answer, it is well to be re-
minded of the question.

Cautions Interpretation.
Dr. Martin said the investi,

to mean that common virusess
could serve as carcinogen-vec,
tors and, that specific immu
nity against a particular virus
could protect against the de-
veloprrsent of tumors triggered
by that virus.
Dr. Martin, cautioned, how-
ever, against "over-interpret«
ing" the findings in mice and
applying them .t'o, ca'ncer, in
man. He said the results should
be considered as a fresh ap-
proach to cancer.

Danger of Can
Found k Viruses
Carrying Chemicals
By MILDRED SPENCER
Buffalo Neaai Stalf Reporter
NEW YORK, June z9+-Vinis
missiles, loaded with a chemical
warhead, may penetrate eelis to
cause some forms of cancer, a
team of New Jersey researchers
suggested to the American Med.
Ica1 Association today. .
Dr. Christopher M. Martin re-
ported studies in Seton Hall Col-
lege of Medicine have shown
that viruses which do not cause
cancer themselves still can trig-
ger the cancer process in~ mice.
They do so, he explained, by
picking up; a load of somee
cancer-causing chemical and
carrying It through the cell
walls, which they penetrate
easily„ into the cell' itself.
The New Jersey team used as
missiles the viruses that cause
grippe-like diseases, cowpox or
vaccinia and one type of polio.
Prevention Might' Be Possible
Viruses migltt' be "vectors" or
carriers; they reasoned, just as
mosquitoes are victors of ma-
laria. The germi that causes
malaria enters the body through
a mosquito bite.
Ifi eancer-causing chemicals in.
air pollutants, industrial wastes
and, certain foods could not get
into the cells without riding, on a&amp;
virus, it might be possible to
prevent the cancers they now
cause by developing vaccines to
.suppress the viruses.
This is how public health work-
r-rs have attacked malaria-by
wiping out the mosquitoes that
carry the germ.,
Develop Variety of Cancers .
w;thout virus carriers. nnh,
large amounts of concer-causing
chemicalfr will cause cancers in
mice, Dr. Martin said. Mice in+
jected with moderate doses of
two such chemicals developed no
cancers, he added.
Mice injected with the viruses
alone did not develop cancers
either. But; when they gpt the
same doses of one of'the chem-
icals and one of the viruses,
they developed a variety of,
cancers:
The investigators then Im•
munized some of their experi-
mental mice against vaccinia
virus. When the immunized!
,mice were In9ected with the ~.
chemical-loaded virus, they de-
veloped no cancers. Bdon+im-
.munized' mice which received
similar doses got cancers;,

Myron Stearns and 141 a x Gun-'
ther in,TuPr~TnvnainaAll over the world since World
War 31, particularly in England
and America,Stearnsand Gun-ther point' out that' the night-
mare of' poisoned air has been

;JL Houdry, a well known petroI-
eum scientist, yvho points out
that the increase In lung cancer
!n meni.has almost exactly par-
alleled the Increase In gasoline
sales. .
Houdry says the answer to
the problem lies in a rernark-~
able c h 1 e in i c a 1 phenomenon
known as cataAysis,, a substance
that makes changes fake. place

self'being permanently affected:
The real magic in catalysis is
that it' can be used to make the
deadliest poisons harmless, the

-Houdry has invent'ed, a car
muffler which has been tested
in, Detroit, but there are sonne
technicalities to be worked out
before motorists can be offered-
an exhaust - cleaning device
ewen as optional equipment.
Houdry and, others who have
stared this menace 1n the face
say that something had better
be done In a hurry.
They add; according to .i~he
article;, that what has bcen
'done is only a fraction of what
remains to be done, pointing out
that every year there are more
people, more industrial plants,
more cars and trucks, with the

The man who invented the modern way to
h ake gasol'uie: famous chemist Eugene J..
!Aoud2n,--claams to have found &amp;way to keep
automobile exhaust fumes from poisoning
""-Houdry, according t&amp; an article iw T
magazine, has developed a catalytic muffler
.wllich attaches to a car's exhaust system and
causes the left-over gasoline to burn.
I
. `, lioudry is.quoted as believing air pollu-
tion ttion is the biggest cause of ltang', cancer, and.
TP ' he rnaintains thato auto exhaust causes most
M of the polluted air. To quote the chemist:
~
O .
O
If it isn't checked, air poiiutian will ba
killing mora than a million people a year
tn the United States alona beforr t#ia end
of'th. century-mainly through lung eanear.
The~ article points out, though, that no one
really knows why lung cancer deaths have
increased' so tremendously .in the past few
decad es: Cigarettes have been blamed, as
everybody knows, but' Houdry"s, findings con-
C vsnce him that the biggest reason, is air pollu-
tiom
Houcliry states his belief'in this way:
. r .:- _ .
The increase in lung cancer among
~ ir~en has almost exact'ly paralleled the
increase in gasoline use-far more close-
ly than it has liaralleled cigarette sales.
U.S. gasoline consumption increased
25 fold from 11915! to 1955; the lung can.
•cer death rate also increased 25 fold
during the same !40-year periodi t•,:Cigarette smoking rose less than three
fold' during, that' period.
c
Amazingly, this man who thinks he has
awayto, lick exhaust' fumes says that froan.
1940 tto 1945, wwhen gasoline was rationed,
consuumption, of the fuel dropped about 35
per cent. The rate of' inK:rease in lung cancer
deaths alko dropped 35 per cent during the
same period.
According to, the magazine article, HouL
dry's muffler Is being researched by automo-
tive coinpaiaies. The biggest problem is said
to be the cost, with $30 suggested.
Tlie piece, entitled "The Silent Killer That
Stalks Our Streets,"' is thought-provoking and'

The article leans heavily on the story "Don't Let Tobacco Trap Your

Dr. John B. Packard,, vice

he said' at a closing session of'

.
From the same panel on.
"Smoking and Health" came
a proposal' for "seif~regula-

companies.
'Ria,tor Health Question'
Dr. M. Powell Lawtoni as-

"Sooner or later the dis-

that there might be:

A warning that education
about the dangPrk of smoking
Is not, reaching youngsters
early enough was sounded by
P+ol' F. Lifson. director of edu-

To• start' teaching, teen.agers
about smokins, is to start teo

ot' the Bioardi of' Directors of the

WEAKEN CHAAGES -
This was Dr. Johnson's posi-
t3on after J. Morris Brady, as-
sociate scientific director of The
Tobacco Industry Research Com+
rpit'tee. failed to eriticiae smok-
ing as a factor contributing to
diseases.
Dn: Brady took the standi that
"new research" tenda to weaken
rather than, support the charges
against smoking as the maf or fac-
tor in lung cancer. Dr. Johnson
spoke directly in opposition to
smoking, saying, "I don't believe
anyone shntild bM encouraged to
smoke. Nobody has been able to
prove that smoking makes the
body better. However, there is
some suggeation that it does
ba rm..
Dr. Johnson poihted' out that
there is "data" that proves the
conditioa of persons suffering'
from hardening' of the arteries
in the legs and, coronary diseases
worsens when they continue to
' smoke.
Dr. Brady said new research
shows many factors may be in-
volved in lung cancer, and ain-
giing out any one factor such as
amoking could delay a solution to
this health problem. He said re-
ceat' scient;fic reports on research
in this couotky and abroad lialt
at least four other factors to
lung cancer.
He named' ..thesr four factors
as previous _lu= damage, emviranw
rnent, viruses aadlsociai and eco+

"Just a few weeks ago a teamm
of scientists reported that husg.
c a n c e r occurs mure ofttsn in
men of lower aoaPal' and economic
status;" be said. This, he aid,
lndicates that dietary and per3 tiaps other influences are Involved
in, the disease.
Dr. Brady said scientists are
giving, increased attention to the
possible roles of viruses in can-
cer. fTe said, a reserach group
reported earlier this month that
human,type lung cancers were
Induced in mice exposed' to in-
fluenza virus and smog.
Lung cancer occurs more often
in persons who have had such
disease as tuberculoais, pneumoo-
nia and intlyenu, he said.
Dr. Johnson said factors a•hich
contribute to hardening of' the
arteries and coronary heart dis•
eases are high concentration in
the blood of fatty substanoes, high
blood pressure or excessive over.
wei¢ht, age and sex.
In another session, Dr. Allen.
P. SmitK Jr., coordinator of psy-,

ENen though he had been

'1Medical School and one of'the
' mo:-t respectPd men, in the fieidi
°'of pathology (the study of bio-
:acgical disorder), Prof. Milton,
: C. W2nternitz;, who died at thee
age of seventy-four •in 1959,
had one theory scientists just'
couldn't accept wholeheartedl$.
His theory involved infiuenza,
and the role of that relatively~
common virus disease in caus-
:, ing lung cancer.
As a young pat'hologist', Dr.
Winternitz studied the effect of
flu on the lungs of many Amer-
icans inthe 191'8 epidemic when
influenza became the greatest
plague of all time,taking 20~-
000.0b0 livoe around' the world.
; He noticed permanent scars
on the lungs which he said
:.',would make those who survived
susceptible to lung' cancer. Idon

int professor of, -pathology, re-

1,600 laboratory mice, diVid-

As recently as la:st' Ja.^.uary.
Dr. Gilbert W. Beebe, a medical
statistician working for the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences;,,
published, a paper showing that:
7,000 World War I veterans whoi
suffered from pneumonia (prob-
ablyrelated to previous infiu-
enza) 1 had no greater lung
cancer rate In later life t'han!
he general population. Th1s,
r. Beebe implied, refuted'Prof.
Winternitz.
But three researchers from,
the University of.Southern Cali-
fornia Medical School think'
otherwise, and, have performed
experiments on mice which,
they say, prove Prof. Winter-
nitz's theory to be correct.
Their findings were an-
nounced in a hitherto unre-
p,,:`ed paper delivered at the
Amerdean, Association o! Cancer
Researchers meeting whlch
,ended In Atlantic City last
week. ..
The paper was read by- Dr.
Dean V. Wiseley, an assistant
F•:ofessor of pathology at
U. S. C,, who described work
that overcame the greatest ob-
jection to the Winterni'tz theory.'
This objection was that the;
influenza virus hadi never been:
implicated as a cause of cancerr
in laboratory animals.

mice, naturally, came down
with the f1u: Into a second
chamber they introduced arti,
,
ficially manufact'ured Los An«
geles smog (which is beiieve&amp;
to cause lung cancer). The mice
in this chamber developed no
disease: Into a third, chamber
they introduced both the flu
virus and the smog. The mice
here developed flu, and those
that survived then developed
lung cancer of the same type
humans suffer. For purposes
of comparison; the riidce in the
fourth chamber receivedi only
filtered' air, and came down
with no disease at all.
Key Findings
The key findings were inn

goti both influenza and cancer:
Sxplaining what happened, Dr:
iKotin said the flu. virus
changed the cell • structure of l
the lung walls permanently.
~hen+ he said„ the cancer-
causing agent made the cells
malignant, that is,,the damaged
cells spread over the • lung;
wa11s,smot'hering the healthy
cells.
Dr. Kotin now believes there
must be some lesion such, as
that caused by Influenza in the
lung ,in which, cancer-causing
agents can get a foothold be-
fore the disease - claims a vic-
tiin,
"Of course, in no way do ae,

They divided the mice into four
groups of 100 each and placedi
them in sealed chambers.
Into one of the chambers
they introduced filtered air

Half of " the mice w(th flu

By Stuart H. Loory' '
ENen though he had been
;; dean of the Yale University
'1Medical School and one of'the
' mo:-t respectPd men, in the fieidi
°'of pathology (the study of bio-
:acgical disorder), Prof. Milton,
: C. W2nternitz;, who died at thee
age of seventy-four •in 1959,
had one theory scientists just'
couldn't accept wholeheartedl$.
His theory involved infiuenza,
and the role of that relatively~
common virus disease in caus-
:, ing lung cancer.
As a young pat'hologist', Dr.
Winternitz studied the effect of
flu on the lungs of many Amer-
icans inthe 191'8 epidemic when
influenza became the greatest
plague of all time,taking 20~-
000.0b0 livoe around' the world.
; He noticed permanent scars
on the lungs which he said
:.',would make those who survived
susceptible to lung' cancer. Idon
~- LOS! AAT(3FfMay 1~lwlruses i which~ cause Influenza
. (A'P): Flu and smog appsr-
ently are among factors which
can help cause lung cancer,
ia University of southern Cali-,
;fornla Arofessor . says.
-Dr. Dean V. Wiseley. assist-
int professor of, -pathology, re-
- ported on a 29-month test ofI
1,600 laboratory mice, diVid-
eid' into four groups. One was
lnjected with 'three stralns of'
ancer' Laid to Flu, Smog


sense, sald his colleagues, the
two diseases are unrelatzd
As recently as la:st' Ja.^.uary.
Dr. Gilbert W. Beebe, a medical
statistician working for the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences;,,
published, a paper showing that:
7,000 World War I veterans whoi
suffered from pneumonia (prob-
ablyrelated to previous infiu-
enza) 1 had no greater lung
cancer rate In later life t'han!
he general population. Th1s,
r. Beebe implied, refuted'Prof.
Winternitz.
But three researchers from,
the University of.Southern Cali-
fornia Medical School think'
otherwise, and, have performed
experiments on mice which,
they say, prove Prof. Winter-
nitz's theory to be correct.
Their findings were an-
nounced in a hitherto unre-
p,,:`ed paper delivered at the
Amerdean, Association o! Cancer
Researchers meeting whlch
,ended In Atlantic City last
week. ..
The paper was read by- Dr.
Dean V. Wiseley, an assistant
F•:ofessor of pathology at
U. S. C,, who described work
that overcame the greatest ob-
jection to the Winterni'tz theory.'
This objection was that the;
influenza virus hadi never been:
implicated as a cause of cancerr
in laboratory animals.

mice, naturally, came down
with the f1u: Into a second
chamber they introduced arti,
,
ficially manufact'ured Los An«
geles smog (which is beiieve&amp;
to cause lung cancer). The mice
in this chamber developed no
disease: Into a third, chamber
they introduced both the flu
virus and the smog. The mice
here developed flu, and those
that survived then developed
lung cancer of the same type
humans suffer. For purposes
of comparison; the riidce in the
fourth chamber receivedi only
filtered' air, and came down
with no disease at all.
Key Findings
The key findings were inn
chamber No. 3 where the mice.
goti both influenza and cancer:
Sxplaining what happened, Dr:
iKotin said the flu. virus
changed the cell • structure of l
the lung walls permanently.
~hen+ he said„ the cancer-
causing agent made the cells
malignant, that is,,the damaged
cells spread over the • lung;
wa11s,smot'hering the healthy
cells.
Dr. Kotin now believes there
must be some lesion such, as
that caused by Influenza in the
lung ,in which, cancer-causing
agents can get a foothold be-
fore the disease - claims a vic-
tiin,
"Of course, in no way do ae,
suggest this is the only mecha-
nisna by which lung cancer
biology, took 400 mice pf aldevelops," Dr. Kotin said in an'
species in which, it is very dii- interview. "What we have done;
ficult to induce lung cancer.
They divided the mice into four
groups of 100 each and placedi
them in sealed chambers.
Into one of the chambers
they introduced filtered air
fimong humans.
Half of " the mice w(th flu
preathed smoggy air, .half
pure air. The mice not' subr
0ected to flu were similarly
divided. Dr. Wiseley said 38
leigions have been fousld, itli

to both flu and' smog, com-
pared wtth 14 for mice exposed
to flu, alone.
here is to take WinterniCz's'

died too sooni you just didn't
have the opportunity to studyy

moke or Not to: Smoke:


th e- .~..rning
r ~~-~y _~ .


-. By JOSEPH G. MOINER', M'.D.
.YEARS ago smoking used to be opposed' on grounds
that it would stunt the growth. There never hass
been any evidence to support thds; but at least It was
an argument that the eighth graders sometimes took
seriously. (If you think kids didn't smoke in the
seventh and eighth grades 40 years ago, you've for-
gotten too much! )
Well; today the big argu-
ment ia that cigarnette smok-
; ing causes lung cancer. And
there's another group that
cnntends, with some evidence,
that there's no proof that -
cigarettes cause lung cancer.
All right. I'll agree. There's

no proof. I' know people who
° have smoked cigarettes since
'World War I' and still have
good liangs.
. I'even know ofsome people
who never smoked cigarettes
and yet died of'lung carncer.
It isn't' ani open-and-shut
rule that if you snoke cigar-
ettes you'll have lung ea.ncer,
and tf'you don't, you won't.
But one fact is now far be-
yond the stage of dispute, so
far as I know: lung cancer
occurs far more frequently
among cigarette smokers thi.n
In any other group.
That's good enough for me,
-The A m er i c a n Cancer
6ociety'is waging a campaign
against teenage smoking. I
hope it Is successful. For any-
body who ineve* starts smok-
- 'ing never mIsses it.
Cancer Isn't, however, the
only factor involved. There's
the cost. There'a the risk of
1ire, in bed, in the woode; or
elsewhere, caused by careless

CANCER CAUSE,
BRITON CLAIMS

Tho, Nia Reports
An English pathologist yes-
terday disputed American
claims that smoking is a primee
factor in lung cancer.
Dr. George J. Cunningham„
pathology professor at the I3oy-
al College of Surgeons, Londbn,
reported on the results of seven •
years of research on causes of'
lung cancer at the meeting of'
the International Academy of
Pathology and' the American
Association of Pathologists and
Bacteriologists in the Drake
bra'eL
He said his research has led
him to be;ieve that bacco
smoke may be a contrib
cause to lung cancer, but iss
not a major cause or " the "
cause.
May Prodhce ' Affiditjr •
Tobacco smoke and " se.
vere " cases of influen¢a have
been found to cause changes in
the microscopic cells of human
lungs which, he said, produce
"



' an affinity " for cancer. Butt
smoking has not been shown
actually to produce cancer of

itself,, he said.

One change noted smong
smokers was an increase in
the fat content of the lung cells,,
which then would be more
prone to absorb other cancer
producing, agents, Dr. Cunning.
ham said.
'
He reported that the changesf' in the lungs were foundi almost'
" universally " among smokers,
but', also were found among

people who never smoked.

I 00' 353~ 2~ 3~

See ' Two Stage Process' ~. :.'
The microscopic cellular y ~
changes apparently produced
by smoking have led Dr. Gti.m-
niagham and other British re-
search men to believe that lung
cancer may be a" two stage
process," he said. The fiFst
stage would be the changes in
the lungs, induced either by
smoking, or severe respiratory
infections.
Dr. Cunningham reported also
that' recent studies in Eng-
land have tended to refute ear-
lier claims that lung cancer
was more prevalent among peoa
ple living in large cities and,
industrial centers.
~
A survey' of' a purely+ rural
area of England showed lung
cancer incidence to be about~
equal'
to that among city resi,

An English pathologist yes-

claims that smoking is a primee
factor in lung cancer.
Dr. George J. Cunningham„
pathology professor at the I3oy-

reported on the results of seven •
years of research on causes of'
lung cancer at the meeting of'
the International Academy of

Tobacco smoke and " se.

been found to cause changes in

smoking has not been shown
actually to produce cancer of

See ' Two Stage Process' ~. :.'
The microscopic cellular y ~
changes apparently produced
by smoking have led Dr. Gti.m-
niagham and other British re-
search men to believe that lung
cancer may be a" two stage
process," he said. The fiFst
stage would be the changes in
the lungs, induced either by
smoking, or severe respiratory
infections.
Dr. Cunningham reported also
that' recent studies in Eng-
land have tended to refute ear-
lier claims that lung cancer
was more prevalent among peoa
ple living in large cities and,
industrial centers.

A survey' of' a purely+ rural

: C. W2nternitz;, who died at thee
age of seventy-four •in 1959,
had one theory scientists just'
couldn't accept wholeheartedl$.
His theory involved infiuenza,
and the role of that relatively~
common virus disease in caus-
:, ing lung cancer.
As a young pat'hologist', Dr.
Winternitz studied the effect of
flu on the lungs of many Amer-
icans inthe 191'8 epidemic when
influenza became the greatest
plague of all time,taking 20~-
000.0b0 livoe around' the world.
; He noticed permanent scars
on the lungs which he said
:.',would make those who survived
susceptible to lung' cancer. Idon

As recently as la:st' Ja.^.uary.
Dr. Gilbert W. Beebe, a medical
statistician working for the Na-

published, a paper showing that:
7,000 World War I veterans whoi
suffered from pneumonia (prob-
ablyrelated to previous infiu-
enza) 1 had no greater lung
cancer rate In later life t'han!

r. Beebe implied, refuted'Prof.
Winternitz.
But three researchers from,
the University of.Southern Cali-

otherwise, and, have performed
experiments on mice which,
they say, prove Prof. Winter-

to cause lung cancer). The mice
in this chamber developed no
disease: Into a third, chamber
they introduced both the flu
virus and the smog. The mice
here developed flu, and those
that survived then developed
lung cancer of the same type

that caused by Influenza in the

fore the disease - claims a vic-
tiin,
"Of course, in no way do ae,

more cigarettes, smoking, and
chewing tobacco than any other
state.
Other ldighlights.
Among the other highlights of
the new booklet:
The 180,000 farm families who
grow tobacco in North Carolina
earned more than $523 million
for their crops last year. They
produced 854! million pounds of to-
bacco, most of it for cigarettes.
Sixty per cent' of last year's
t7: S: cigarette production of some
512 million cigarettes came from
North Carolina factories, whose
annual' payroll is about $95 mll~
lion. Nort,h, Carolina plant8 also
produced about 50 million pounds
of' smoking and I chewing tobacco '
andl about two million pounds of
anuff:
Ninety of the state's 100 coun-
ties grow tobacco.
Cigarette smokers in the state
paid $47 million in federal excise
taxes and i more than $4 million in
state sales taxes in the latest'
fiscal year.
Some 33,000 outlets in North
Carolina selli tobacco products;
the wholesale value of the prod.
ucts sold was $86 million for the
latest year of record.

automobile exhaust fumes from poisoning
""-Houdry, according t&amp; an article iw T
magazine, has developed a catalytic muffler
.wllich attaches to a car's exhaust system and
causes the left-over gasoline to burn.
I
. `, lioudry is.quoted as believing air pollu-

If it isn't checked, air poiiutian will ba

tn the United States alona beforr t#ia end
of'th. century-mainly through lung eanear.
The~ article points out, though, that no one
really knows why lung cancer deaths have
increased' so tremendously .in the past few
decad es: Cigarettes have been blamed, as
everybody knows, but' Houdry"s, findings con-
C vsnce him that the biggest reason, is air pollu-
tiom
Houcliry states his belief'in this way:
. r .:- _ .
The increase in lung cancer among
~ ir~en has almost exact'ly paralleled the
increase in gasoline use-far more close-
ly than it has liaralleled cigarette sales.
U.S. gasoline consumption increased
25 fold from 11915! to 1955; the lung can.

'O -Y0 UR GOOD HEALTH
moke or Not to: Smoke:


th e- .~..rning
r ~~-~y _~ .


-. By JOSEPH G. MOINER', M'.D.
.YEARS ago smoking used to be opposed' on grounds
that it would stunt the growth. There never hass
been any evidence to support thds; but at least It was
an argument that the eighth graders sometimes took
seriously. (If you think kids didn't smoke in the
seventh and eighth grades 40 years ago, you've for-
gotten too much! )
Well; today the big argu-
ment ia that cigarnette smok-
; ing causes lung cancer. And
there's another group that
cnntends, with some evidence,
that there's no proof that -
cigarettes cause lung cancer.
All right. I'll agree. There's

no proof. I' know people who
° have smoked cigarettes since
'World War I' and still have
good liangs.
. I'even know ofsome people
who never smoked cigarettes
and yet died of'lung carncer.
It isn't' ani open-and-shut
rule that if you snoke cigar-
ettes you'll have lung ea.ncer,
and tf'you don't, you won't.
But one fact is now far be-
yond the stage of dispute, so
far as I know: lung cancer
occurs far more frequently
among cigarette smokers thi.n
In any other group.
That's good enough for me,
-The A m er i c a n Cancer
6ociety'is waging a campaign
against teenage smoking. I
hope it Is successful. For any-
body who ineve* starts smok-
- 'ing never mIsses it.
Cancer Isn't, however, the
only factor involved. There's
the cost. There'a the risk of
1ire, in bed, in the woode; or
elsewhere, caused by careless
smokers. There's "cigarette
cough."' I could, but won't,
name an eminenit cancer,
authority who finally quit,
not because of the cancer
risk, but because he coughed
so hard he couldn't get enough
sleep.
Bmoking, however enjoy-
able, ie not a healthbil! habit,
and the only honeat advice
I can give is, "Don't."
I. don't really expect mY
Nordri to have any treat et-
foat, It'a all been saidi betore,
and nothing tnuch happened.
' For reaaons 11 don't undirr-
stand, there seems to be some
urge for. young people to
smoke, even though they
don°t, in the beginning„ enjoy
It. I guess it makes them feel
grown up.
I remember a big, lumber-
ing boy named Emil, in my
own eighth grade class, who
used' to smoke cigarettes right
on the street. And one 'cold
day he remarked candidly,
"There's one thing about these
butts, they keep your nose
warm."
They really don't, of course,
but that's about' how much
logic there Is in amoking..
I' guess maybe the old Idea,

"don't smoke until you are,

aa any. At least it postpi
the practice. And postponing
is at deast some i Improvement
over beginning smoking In
childhood.
Skirmishes between the American Cancer Society andi
the tobacco industry go on apace. The Society has&amp;
again proposed that packages of cigarette be
labeled with the percentage of tars and nicotine in,
each smoke. The Tobacco Institute, oountering, says
the Idea Isn't practical. :'There, are no accept'edi

of '

ST. PETERSB1PbtG, F1a.,14lar:
32:-If you want to calm aa
hackingi "cigarette cough,"'
switeh~ to a cigarette with less
_ tar and nicotine if you can't
stop smoking.
This Is no advertising, man's
lingo; but a serious suggestion
from a cancer researcher who
~~ studied the problem in more
`,han 40.000, nersons.
In fact, Dr. E. Cuyler Ham-
-nond~ statistical director of'the
Tmerican Cancer Society, would
'Ike to see laws passed to re-
7uire cigarette manufacturers
to print the nicotine and tar
content of the smoke right on
the package.
Naturally, Dr. Hammond said.
the "smoker's hack"' itself can
induce the smoker to changr
his brandl smoke less, inhalr
less and sometimes give up
smoking altogether.
Dr. Hammond uncovered the
relationship between, the tar
and the cough of'the smoker
during the second stage of hie
investigation, of the effects of
smoking and other habits on
health.
Link to Cancer
His flrst'study„ in coilabora-
tion with Dr. Daniel Horn.
showed cigarette smoking to
be associared with, high deat:,
rates from lung caneer. coro-
nary artery heart attack.,.
peptic ulcers and infectiour
diseases of the lungs.
"I'm convinced,"' Dr. Ham-
mond sa'id, "that' cigarette
smoking is a major causativee
factor in lung cancer. Either
people should' give up smoking
or we should find a safer cigar
-
ette. In our present' study we
are seeking clews to safety,
since I don't think people will
easily give up smoking."
40,000 Studied
The current figures on coughs
and twenty-two other, physical
complaints came out of Dr.
Hammond's new, study, in col-
laboration, with Dr. Lawrence
Garfinkel, of the habits of
1,000.000 persons, The 4!0.000.
individuals w•ere chosen, at ram-
quent death and disease.
Dr. Hammond said: "When
one looks at the figures of
physical complaints as related
to smoking, one wonders which
of them are not associated with
the habit."
Nervous Tension
Besides coughdng, cigarette
smokers among both men andi
women suffer from, shortness
of, breath and loss of appetite
more frequently than, do non-
smokers. Nervous tension is alsoo
associated witih s4noking, he re-
portiedL
"It may be that nervous ten-
sion increases the tendency too
smoke heavily," he said. "but it
may also be that smoking in-
creases nervous tension in thee
light of the known effects of'.
.iicotine on nerves. Further-
:nore, both may be true."
Other, ccomplaints associat'edd
with cigarette smoking in-
-luded nausea and vomiting;
pain in the stomach or lower
abdomen„ diarrhea6 fat'iguing
easily and loss of weight.
Among women between the
ages of thirty and forty-nine,
menstrual irregularities were
reported more by the smokers..
The frequency of all com-
plaints increased with~ smok-
iiag. These complaints, Dr.'
I4ammond suggested, often in-
duced Individuals to smoke less,
inhale less, switch brands or
quit' smoking, just as coughing
does. 1'
Women and b'fen,
Women inhale less, smoke
fewer and milder cigarettes
and st'art' smoking later than
men do. Cigar and pipe smok-
ers Inhale much less than
cigarette smokers, because the
smoke apparently is more ir-
ritating to the lungs.
College graduates are among
the greatest number who have
given, up cigarette smoking and
are those who smoke 1ow-tar,
low-nicotine cigarettes.
Dr. Hammond said that fol-
lowing the Srst report of the
association between lung can-
cer and cigarette smoking,
there was a decrease In the per
capita consumption of ciga,
rettes. But the figure rose again
until today it is at the highest
level ever.
The reason, he said, appears
to lie in the large increase in
smoking among, young people
and women. Adult men, i'f any-
thing, have decreased the
amount of their smoking, hee

B'y Earl Ubell

Science Writer
ST. PETERSB1PbtG, F1a.,14lar:
32:-If you want to calm aa
hackingi "cigarette cough,"'
switeh~ to a cigarette with less
_ tar and nicotine if you can't
stop smoking.
This Is no advertising, man's
lingo; but a serious suggestion
from a cancer researcher who
~~ studied the problem in more
`,han 40.000, nersons.
In fact, Dr. E. Cuyler Ham-
-nond~ statistical director of'the
Tmerican Cancer Society, would
'Ike to see laws passed to re-
7uire cigarette manufacturers
to print the nicotine and tar
content of the smoke right on
the package.
Naturally, Dr. Hammond said.
the "smoker's hack"' itself can
induce the smoker to changr
his brandl smoke less, inhalr
less and sometimes give up
smoking altogether.
Dr. Hammond uncovered the
relationship between, the tar
and the cough of'the smoker
during the second stage of hie
investigation, of the effects of
smoking and other habits on
health.
Link to Cancer
His flrst'study„ in coilabora-
tion with Dr. Daniel Horn.
showed cigarette smoking to
be associared with, high deat:,
rates from lung caneer. coro-
nary artery heart attack.,.
peptic ulcers and infectiour
diseases of the lungs.
"I'm convinced,"' Dr. Ham-
mond sa'id, "that' cigarette
smoking is a major causativee
factor in lung cancer. Either
people should' give up smoking
or we should find a safer cigar
-
ette. In our present' study we
are seeking clews to safety,
since I don't think people will
easily give up smoking."
40,000 Studied
The current figures on coughs
and twenty-two other, physical
complaints came out of Dr.
Hammond's new, study, in col-
laboration, with Dr. Lawrence
Garfinkel, of the habits of
1,000.000 persons, The 4!0.000.
individuals w•ere chosen, at ram-
quent death and disease.
Dr. Hammond said: "When
one looks at the figures of
physical complaints as related
to smoking, one wonders which
of them are not associated with
the habit."
Nervous Tension
Besides coughdng, cigarette
smokers among both men andi
women suffer from, shortness
of, breath and loss of appetite
more frequently than, do non-
smokers. Nervous tension is alsoo
associated witih s4noking, he re-
portiedL
"It may be that nervous ten-
sion increases the tendency too
smoke heavily," he said. "but it
may also be that smoking in-
creases nervous tension in thee
light of the known effects of'.
.iicotine on nerves. Further-
:nore, both may be true."
Other, ccomplaints associat'edd
with cigarette smoking in-
-luded nausea and vomiting;
pain in the stomach or lower
abdomen„ diarrhea6 fat'iguing
easily and loss of weight.
Among women between the
ages of thirty and forty-nine,
menstrual irregularities were
reported more by the smokers..
The frequency of all com-
plaints increased with~ smok-
iiag. These complaints, Dr.'
I4ammond suggested, often in-
duced Individuals to smoke less,
inhale less, switch brands or
quit' smoking, just as coughing
does. 1'
Women and b'fen,
Women inhale less, smoke
fewer and milder cigarettes
and st'art' smoking later than
men do. Cigar and pipe smok-
ers Inhale much less than
cigarette smokers, because the
smoke apparently is more ir-
ritating to the lungs.
College graduates are among
the greatest number who have
given, up cigarette smoking and
are those who smoke 1ow-tar,
low-nicotine cigarettes.
Dr. Hammond said that fol-
lowing the Srst report of the
association between lung can-
cer and cigarette smoking,
there was a decrease In the per
capita consumption of ciga,
rettes. But the figure rose again
until today it is at the highest
level ever.
The reason, he said, appears
to lie in the large increase in
smoking among, young people
and women. Adult men, i'f any-
thing, have decreased the
amount of their smoking, hee

~ Cigaret smoke may contain a wax-;ike chemical that
fjp acts to block the cancer causing process in human beings,
Cn according to Dr. Ernest L. Wynder, of the S1Gan-Ketter-
~ ing IRlstiltllte. He says the, smoke also contains two other
0,substances-one that acts to cause cancer and• another
p without whose "prorrlotion" the' first chemi+cal' could not
- 'cause the disease.
S
: In a paper read at the annual
meeting in Atlantic City of the
American Assn: for Cancer Re-
search, Dr. Wynder said yes-
terday the cancer-causing chem-
icals In cigaret smoke are
known as carcinogens.
, These chemicals, he said, are
stimulated Into deadly action
by a second group of, chemicals
known as "promoters." With-
out these, he said, the carciilo•
gens cannot causc cancer. `
: The third group he labelbd
anti-carcinogens and' said they
act' to block the cancer-causing
process.
! Dr. Wynder outlined a flve.
t point program designed to elim-
inatie from cigaret smoking
whaever lung cancer danger he
said there rnight exist by filter-
ing, out as many as i~ossible of
the causes and promoter ichem-
icals and adding the • blocking,
chemicals to eigarets..
The program included:
More effective' fllteration of
cigarets.
Selective !11'tration of the pro-
moters in smoke.
Selection of' tobacco contain-
ing less of the two harmful
chemicals.
Use of additives to cause.
more complete burning of to-
bacco to eliminate the harmful
material; which' he said' result
from incomplete burning.
Adding the anti-carcinogenicc
chemicals.
eomplete burning of' the to,
bacce. The carcinogenic mate-
rials, he said, are the result of
incomplete burning of the to-
bacco.
5. Addin'g anti-carcinogenic
chemicals to cigarettes. •
Dr. Wynder't report was on
results obtainedi from rubbing
tobacco smoke rnnoentrFite and
concentrated automob+_le ex-
haust gases on the skiris of
thousands oflive mice'and then'
determining which substance
developed more' tumor&amp;
On some of his mice he first
rubbed' the carcinogens from
cigarette smoke. No tumors de-
veloped! Then he added the pro-
moters„and tumors called "pap-
Illomas" (which are not can-
c'erous) develop_ed. ___ .
Then he' took another set of
mice and treated their skins
with~ the auto exhaust gases.
Auto bxhaust (also believed to
be a lung cancer cause), he
said~ contained far greater
amounts of the carcinogenic
materiali than cigarette smoke..
However, Dr. Wynder found,
to his~surprise, that the exhaust'
produced far fewer tumors ,'
(judged in relation to the ciga-
ret'te snpke) than it's excessive
amount of' carcinogenic mate-
rial indicated it should. This he
attributed to a greater amount
of anti-carcinogenic material hi.
auto exhaust than in cigarettes.
Dr. Wynder's report of anti-
carcinogens-deliivered' for the
first time today-was confirmedd
by separate experiments done
at the University of Southern.
California by Drs. Hans L. Salk
and Paul Kotin, who reported
finding anti-carcinogenic mate-
rial in Los Angeles smog, which
contains a large amount of autb,
exhaust. .
2 Drugs C.ive' Hope
Earlier in the day, five re-
searchers searchers from Roswell Park
Memorial Inst7tute' in Buffalo,
reported hopeful use of thvo
drugs to combat aduanced' lung
cancer. Speaking for the' flvec,
Dr. Charles A. Ross, chief of
thoracic (chest) surgery, at the
institute said t'wenty, of forty-'
eight patients treated with the
new drugs underwent remis-
sions of the disease that last'edi
from two weeks to, a year and, a,
quarter„' the average being
three weeks in, the case of one
-drug and fourteen weeks in the
other. ' - The drugs, labeled AB-103
and AB.132, are in the family
called alkylating agents, as Is
nitrogen mustard, which is cur-
rently used in fighting cancer. .
Dr. Ross said the new drugs
offered hope because of the
high number of, patients who
responded to i the treatment.
It was used, he said, on three
patients in whom the cancer
had already spread to their
brains andi had paralyzed
them. Two of the three recov-
ered from their paralysis, were,'
able to walk and were released
from the hospital. The cancer,
he said, returned, however.
"These drugs are far from
being as effective as we want
them to be. They're certainly
not' cures, but maybe they show
we're on the right track," Dr.
Ross reported.

WASHINGTON - Two accidents
of history helped North Carolina
become the hub of' the tobacco
uMverse, according to a new
booklet, "North Carolina and To-
bacco," published by The To-
bacco Institute, Inc:.
The accidents:
In 1 1839, a young slave in Cas -
well County discovered a new cur-
ing, process that producedl spar-
kling, bright-yellow leaves, now
called bright tobacco.
At the end of' the Civill War;,
bundreds of demobilized soldiers.
"appropriated"' a supply of smok-
Ing tobacco fromi a Durham plant.
They liked it and pleaded! for
more from their homes alli over,
the United States. This led to
world-wide fame for North Caro-
lina tobacco.
Today the state produces more
leaf tobacco andi manufactures
more cigarettes, smoking, and
chewing tobacco than any other
state.
Other ldighlights.
Among the other highlights of
the new booklet:
The 180,000 farm families who
grow tobacco in North Carolina
earned more than $523 million
for their crops last year. They
produced 854! million pounds of to-
bacco, most of it for cigarettes.
Sixty per cent' of last year's
t7: S: cigarette production of some
512 million cigarettes came from
North Carolina factories, whose
annual' payroll is about $95 mll~
lion. Nort,h, Carolina plant8 also
produced about 50 million pounds
of' smoking and I chewing tobacco '
andl about two million pounds of
anuff:
Ninety of the state's 100 coun-
ties grow tobacco.
Cigarette smokers in the state
paid $47 million in federal excise
taxes and i more than $4 million in
state sales taxes in the latest'
fiscal year.
Some 33,000 outlets in North
Carolina selli tobacco products;
the wholesale value of the prod.
ucts sold was $86 million for the
latest year of record.
The new illustrated booklet Is
available from The Tobacco In-
stitute, Inc., 910 17th Street6

Study Links Smoking
te Premature Births
BALTIMORE, lVld. -(1Pf-
A study of 2,736 prcgnant
women here iiadicated' more
premature births a m o n g
those who smoked cigarets
than among those wRri'~id
not: a- city health official
said Friday.
The survey, conducted by
the Baltimore health depart-
ment's bureau of biostatistics
over a 21/2-year period, was
reported at a meeting of the
Johns Hopkins ?Vledical' and.
Suraical association.
THE REPORT said' that,
among the women surveyed,
11.1 per cent of those who
did not smoke hadipremature
births, while the percentahe
rose to 22.9 for women smok
ing rnnre than one pack a
day.
Todd IM. Frazer. dirFrtror rnfl
the heallrh agency.: sairl tiha
a l+ ro a r F n t relationship be=
tiween smokingarnd the pr~e-
naatnrity rate might be a eo•
incidence:
"The smoker - nonsmoker
difference in p r e mat urity
rates prevailed' in the pres+
ence of'several other factors
which could possibly have
causedl a spurious associa-
t'im" Frazer said.
"From t'his study there was
a reduced prematurity rate
among, the 1,54 women who
elected to stop smoking dur-
ing pregnancy.
"HOWEVER, there is no
evidence that' a reduction in
prematurity rate could he
achieved in a, ranrlomly se-•
lected groupiby their eurtail:
ing or stoppirog, smoking, dur-
ing pregnancy.
"Until the role of smoking
in its association with inr
creased prematurity is deter-
mined„cachlobst'etrician inusl
decide whether or not to ad-
Ivi'se his patients to limiit
smoking.'•
The health department re-
port cited three fiactors which
might' explain an increase in.
prematurity. among smokers:
These includ'ed' loss of ma-:
ternal appetite and conse-
quent redwction of the weight
of the baby, constriction of
the blood vessels resulting in
poor fetal nutrition, and! the .
possibility that other charac-
teristics responsible for pre-
maturity may have something
t-ido with the urge to smoke.

iielp clear up the unanswesed
questions about smoking and
health.
Dr. Clarence Cook Little: in his"
1!160 annual report proposed these
,teps for medical researchers:
1. Determine whether cancer
can be produced in anitnaT tissue
by applying "whole" smoke. In
experiments where animals in-
haledi whole smoke, lung cancer
has not resulted:
2. Improve and broaden statis-
ticall investigations by obtaining
information through direct med-
ical examination, instead' of' by
questionnaire; and by collecting
information on personal charac-
teristics and habits other than
just smoking.
3! Improve and agree upon
methods of classifying major
types of lung cancer. This would
inake studies of the disease and
relative rates more meaningful.
Some reports have associated
.+uukino with one type of' ]ttn;;, cancer, but' not with, another.
D'Ibre to Learn
"The one hardi fact we mtt;t
face up to is that there is so
much more to find out',"' Dr. Lit-
tle said. -
New research money appropri-`
ated for 1981 brings to a total' of
.$4,650.000 the amount put up so
far for the TIRC research pro-
gram: From these funds„ the
.Scientfific Advisory Roard' has
aw•arded' through 1960 grants-in-
aid' to more than 100 1 independent
scientists in about 70 research
institutiotts ini this country.
In his annual report, Dr. Little
said "Evidence of the complex
factors involved in the origin and
nature of these diseases (lune
cancer and heart disease) con-
tinues to increase in quantity,
depth and scientific significance.
"The result is that the tobaceo
theory is rapidly losing much of
the unique irnportancei claimed
by iLs adherents at its original'
announcement."
The absence of new evidence
of "increasedi significanee," Dr.
Little noted, "leaves the causa-
tion theory of smoking in lung
cancer, heart disease, and other
ailtnent:s without clinical or ex-
perimental proof."

NEW ' YORK-The scientific di-
rector of the Tobacco Industry
Research Committee yesterday
-~a;pested three research steps tno
iielp clear up the unanswesed
questions about smoking and
health.
Dr. Clarence Cook Little: in his"
1!160 annual report proposed these
,teps for medical researchers:
1. Determine whether cancer
can be produced in anitnaT tissue
by applying "whole" smoke. In
experiments where animals in-
haledi whole smoke, lung cancer
has not resulted:
2. Improve and broaden statis-
ticall investigations by obtaining
information through direct med-
ical examination, instead' of' by
questionnaire; and by collecting
information on personal charac-
teristics and habits other than
just smoking.
3! Improve and agree upon
methods of classifying major
types of lung cancer. This would
inake studies of the disease and
relative rates more meaningful.
Some reports have associated
.+uukino with one type of' ]ttn;;, cancer, but' not with, another.
D'Ibre to Learn
"The one hardi fact we mtt;t
face up to is that there is so
much more to find out',"' Dr. Lit-
tle said. -
New research money appropri-`
ated for 1981 brings to a total' of
.$4,650.000 the amount put up so
far for the TIRC research pro-
gram: From these funds„ the
.Scientfific Advisory Roard' has
aw•arded' through 1960 grants-in-
aid' to more than 100 1 independent
scientists in about 70 research
institutiotts ini this country.
In his annual report, Dr. Little
said "Evidence of the complex
factors involved in the origin and
nature of these diseases (lune
cancer and heart disease) con-
tinues to increase in quantity,
depth and scientific significance.
"The result is that the tobaceo
theory is rapidly losing much of
the unique irnportancei claimed
by iLs adherents at its original'
announcement."
The absence of new evidence
of "increasedi significanee," Dr.
Little noted, "leaves the causa-
tion theory of smoking in lung
cancer, heart disease, and other
ailtnent:s without clinical or ex-
perimental proof."

Substances have been found in

Dr. Wynder has made similar
suggestions before, but today
was the first time that he had
experimental results on which
to base proposals that selective
filtration and the addition of,
anti-carcinogens to cigarettes

Dr. Wynder incorporated, the
finding into a five-point plan

what he calls the caroinogenic,
or cancer-causing, effects of
cigarette smoking.

CIGARETTES YIELD
GLUES ON CANCER
Inhibitors in Smokie Are Said
to Curb Carcinogenics.-
A'dditives Are Suggested

By JOHN A. OSMUNDSEN
.- Spedal to :The New York Tlmes.
ATLANTIC CITY, April 9-
Substances have been found in
cigarette smoke that inhibit the
action ofl other chemicals there
that have been said to cause
cancer:.
The discovery was revealed
here today by Dr. Ernest L.
Wynder of the Sloan-Kettering,
~1003673
carcinogenic agents in eigarettee
smoke rondensate resulted from
comparative studies of the
tumor-producing effects of
automobile exhaust an'd' of ciga,
ret'te smoke, he said
Condensates of automobile
cigarette smoke, inhibited the
late matter' in cigarette smoke
as possible.
9Selective filtration to reduce
the amount of' certain specific
substances that' have been
found to promote tumor growth
in experimental animals.
9Selection of tobaccos that
contain few of the chemicals
that have been found'to cause
experimental tumors.
BAddition to tobaccos. of
agents, such as copper nitrate,
that would enhance combustion
and thereby reduce the amount',
of incomplete combustion prod,
~ucts that have been found to
~e carcinogenic.
I 9'incorporation into cigarettes
of ant'i-carcinogenic substances
such as the ones Dr. Wynder
has reported finding or of sub«
istances that would be eonverted
to such chemicals on burning.
Dr. Wynder has made similar
suggestions before, but today
was the first time that he had
experimental results on which
to base proposals that selective
filtration and the addition of,
anti-carcinogens to cigarettes
~ught be possible.
He said in an interview fol-
~owing the presentation of' his
paper at Haddon Hall that his
aboratory was working with a
~ilter=substance that appears to
be effective in removing, chemi-
Inst'itute for Cancer Research.
He has studied the relationship
between cigarette smoking and
cancer for the last twelve years.
Dr. Wynder incorporated, the
finding into a five-point plan
" for measures that might reduce
what he calls the caroinogenic,
or cancer-causing, effects of
cigarette smoking.
The plan, as he presented it
at a closing, session of the fifty-
second annual meeting of the

Of Smoking-Cancer Link.
\iost Evansville teen-agers believe
thero is some link betx=oen cancer and
smoking, but they, ask= I or more posi-
tive proo.f before condemninb cigarettes
as the definite cause of lung cancer. .
Several who said they did smoke
added that they would stop if they
felt there were any definite conn,-ction;
A few were emphatic in pointing
out that there was no established proof.
And until there is they will refuse to
acknowledge any reletiionship; they
said.
"I smoke now ana thenT" Mike
Broerman„ Memorial junior,, remarked,
w "but if a connection bet~Ween cancer
and smoking were ever shown, I believe
I would stop and n*st other people
aould~ too." '
EXCESSIVE &gt;ribuking is bad for a
.person's heaUth, StcVe Tipton, Bosse
junior, poiintedl out, '~ut that doesn't
~necessamily mean it ciiusc, lung cancer.
Steve said he didnlt think smoking
irt moderation would al'fect the hangs.
Memorial sophornorc Lorraine Reit'z
said she thoug Yit it wouid depend upon
the person and the quantity and quali-
ty of the cigarette.
"Smoking may be a factor in the
cause of lung cancer,"' Delor s Jones,
Central senior, remarked. ut she
added she didn't think it cou d'oe the
sole cause.
"NCNS.I'IfDIfERS usuiall,y live longer
than those who dos mio k e," Su-
zanne Winterath, Rex Mundi fresh-
man, commented. "They are health-
ier and wouldi therefore be liess likelly
to contract diseases like cancer:"'
"You're better off if you don't
smoke at all," Bob Kaylor, Memorial,
senior, remarked.
Kathy Flynn, Memorial sophomore,
said she believes smoking does have a
relation to lung cancer, but' that can-
cer wouldi be caused from smoking only
if' the person were a heavy smoker and'
had been smoking for many years.
Ron Brown, Central senior,, said
most magazine and newspaper articles
seem to agree that.smoking has some-
thing to do with lung, cancer. There
must be something to it, he said.
"CERTAINLY the fear of getting
cancer hasWt stopped many people
from smoking," Joan Pritchett, Rex
Mundi jianibr, remarked. "Probably
because there has never been any real
proof."
Sa!ndy Blackburn, Bosse senior, ard gued that there was no relationship, be-
cause if there were there would be
more cases of lung cancer.
• Myrna Bullock, also a senior at
Bosse, said she thought there must be
some physical weakness to start with,
although, smoking, may lead to lung
cancer.

€: to keep automobile exhaust
; fumes from poisoning the
f air. , . . . . - .. ..
:; After 15 years of research,.
,world-famous chemist Eu4-
gene J. Houdry, who ih-
' vented the catalytic craek-
.-,ang, process, has come up
with the answer, according
-.'to an article in the curnent.
Ivlay issue of True maga-
,zine.
The secret is a catalytic
muffler which attaches to a
car's exhaust system and
causes the left-over gaso-
line to burnL
The article discusses the
problem, of air pollution in
various cities, especially Los
Angeles, which has 200
days of' smog a year: New
York City has 50.
A mass tragedy occurred
~in, London in 1952, when
6000 persons died during a
five-week spell of'heavy air
pollution.
Houdry believes air pollu-
tion is the biggest cause of
lung cancer, and that auto-
mobile exhaust causes most
of the polluted air.
"If it isn't checkedl" says
Houdry, "air pollution will
be killing more than a mil-
lion, people a year in the
United States alone before
-tlhe endl of the century-

Dr. Hammond said the tar and'nicntine cnn+

Cigaret companies; through t!he blendl2i,:~
of' high or low nicotine tobaccos, have con
siderable flexibility in fixing the nicotine lec•elks
of their products. They are abie, to reduce,
considerably the tar and nicotine levels in,
their various brands, but cih:ciret company
officials say this also reduces the flavor andl
sati;:faetion given the smoker. ;1'Iost of the,
cigao•et's flavor, comes from the smoke snlidts

There will be no one cancer drug, no one protective an encouraging drop in breast' cancer recurrence rates-
'
of simultaneous drug, treatment and surgery,
shot, no one preventive method! he and other, specialists the result
emphasized. There will rather be many methods g~ing
down many roads.
The t'reatment of some cancers-including leukemia.
Hodgkin's disease, breast cancer, lung, cancer and,
stomach cancer -remains discouragingly difficult.
Still, medical science is now saving about one cancer
patient in three.
The Cancer society saidE
"There are now more than a million Americans aliveo who have been cured of cancer. By 'cured' we mean they
are alive without evidence of the disease at least fuvee
years after diagnosis or treatment."
Cure Rate Increases Yearly
The cure rate or over-all five-year survival rate is
increasing by about 1'' per cent a year, according m the
National Cancer institute in Washington.
f6ve year survival rate for
Including all cancers
the
~
,
early, localized cancers is 64 per cent. The rate for late
and widespread cancers is a, dim 5 per cent.
There is a trend toward earlier diagnosis~: A New
York tumor registry recently reviewed 4;112 cases. In
19,50 only 38 per cent of all cancers diagnosed were early
-and' localized. In 1956 this figure had reached 49 per cent.
The conclusicn was that to some extent the message
is getting across. Patients and doctors are learning t'hat'
cancer curability depends on early detection, rapid diag-
nosis and' quick, vigorous 4ireatment.
In more and more fields of'treatment4 research men
are saying: "We think we may be just a few years ativay'
now from real' progress."
Progress Is Slow But' Sure
Often the progress comes a bit at' a time, so it is
never a big, dramatic story. But Dr. Warren H. Cole, headd
of the University of' Chicago surgery department, said:
"Mmre adivances in cancer, treatment have been made in
the past 15 years than in centuries."
Surgeons, for example, have learned to keep many
more patients alive after drastic operations: They know
more about human physiology. They give their patients
far more care after aperations,
They work ini most cases withi an expert IWID~anes-
thesiologist-a vast advance inicutting operative deaths.
Most important of' all, Cole said, they have improved
the simple-sound'ing, matter of nutrition, which means
giving, surgical patients everything from blood proteins
to special sugars and amino acids..

There arre now several anticancer drugs. None is a

Anticancer Drugs Are New

one knows why:.
These drugs, however often prolong life and relieve
discomfort and pain. And..i they have produced a$harp
increase in the life span of, children with acute leukemia~
Even at best, however, only 15 per cent of these chil-
drenisurvive five years.
The anticancer drug business is only about 10 years
One Genuine 'Brealttltrou+gh"
The last decade has seen one genuine cancer detec-
tioni "breakthrough"-the phrase used Saturday by Ruth-
erford Ellis of' Atlanta, Ga., chairman of' the Cancer so• '
ciety's board' of directors.
This is the "Pap smear" method of Dr. George N:
Papanicolaou of Cornell medical center. Based on the fact .
that cast-off cancer cells may be found in body fluids, it
turns up early evidence of cancer of the womb and the
cervix (the neck of the womb).
Largely as a result of recent use of this test, the last
generation has seen a 40 per cent drop in deaths of wom-
en from uterine cancer.
It is not the only early detection and diagnostic meth-
od in cancer; though it is one of the simplest. The Cancer
society said 50i per cent of all present cancer patients
could be saved if patients and doctors took advantage of
all available means.
There are also, dramatic possibilities in cancer pre-
vention, this society believes.
Those Teen-Age Smokers
As a first' target, it is choosing cigaret smoking
among teen-agers.
There are stilll competent scientists who, consider the
smoking-lung cancer link thin or unproved -or possibly
false. But the Cancer society, withl the bulk of, informed
research'men, thinks the link is well established.
"If cigaret smoking were terminated," maintained,
Dr. Michael• B. Shimkin of the Nationali Cancer institute,
"the annual mortality from lung cancer could be redtaced'
by more than 60 per cent, a saving of at least 20,000,
lives in therJnited, States~ alone."
Apparently most practicing doctors now agree, too.
The National Opinion Research center' of the University
of Chicago last year made a nationwide sampling of'
doctors' opinions, asking: "Is cigaret smoking a major
cause of lung cancer?"
Sixty-four per cent of' the doctors said "definitely"
or "probably."' Twenty-tvro per cent said' "probably not"
or "definitely not." The rest had no opinion.
As the result of studies like these, the Cancer so-
ciety is showing high school' students, many of them
already smokers, a film strip called "To Smoke or Not
to Smoke?" It in, effect tells youths: "Here are the facts.
The decision is yours."'

in basic anticancer research. There have undoubtedly
been some crucially important discoveries whose true
significance is st'ill unknown.
. It will take still more discoveries to point to~ the
right roadways for more cancer cures.

mann has given a comprehensive
story of tobacco's history:.
His well,illustratedi book is the
story of man's progress in the
more than 300, years since Sir
Walter Raleigh took some sam-
ples back to Ehgland. It also of-
fers proof that man seemed to,
benefit from his love of' 'Lady
Nicotine.
Heimann Is a sociologist' and
his book has a defnnite sociolog-
ical tone, making it -a little dry
reading for persons not partic-
lularly interested in this phase
of tobacco's history..
His thesis is that tobacco was
a sort of' economic aid which
eased America into power and
wealth. This seemed to have spe-
cial merit during the early days
when tobacco was the major con-
Icerm of Southern colonies, being
used, as currency in many in-
stances.
Tobacco, according to Hei,
manni also led, Thomas Jefferson,
to urge the young nation's ex-
pansion weriwardl In many ways,
it was responsible for Kentucky
and Tennessee to grow to state-
hood:
Heimann spends much space,
and' wisely so, on the story of
tobacco's transition and changing
public tastes„ from the time In-
dians smoked it mixedl with su-
mac and willow bark to the
white man's method of curing,
drying, storing for long periods
and heating it to make it mel-
lower and' better-tasting.
Fitting Description
He refers many times to to&lt;
bacco as a, "creature cmmfort'`
and that description seems to fit'
perfectly, even in the current jet
age when it still is the base of
one of the nation's greatest in•
dizstries. .
Referring again to j burley's
pnrt in this publication, Heimann
devotes perhaps as muchi space
to this as to other types. He is
concerned more with tobaeeo in
a general sense, but does deivee
briefly intb different types.
Heimannfs book, ini addition to
a wealth of printed information,
contains more than 300 illustra-
tions. It is ai fitting addition to
the library of anyone interested
in, tobacco ini particular and his-
tory in general.

THE JOURNAL and SENTINEL
Winston-Salem, NorthiCarolirsa
June 12, 1960 ,
WHEN THE INDIANS, in a moment of trusting hos-
pitality, thrust a handful of tobacco upon the white man
and Sir Walter Raleigh made it al respectable indulgence,
they had no cause to, envision the magnitude of' such aa
g,esture:
Nevertheless, for the rank and file, tobacco products
have become alknost as much in, demand as food itselfS and
nowhere is the impact of that, common usage felt more
keenly than rialit' here in Piedmont North Carolina.
The histoiy of tobacco is arl interestin!g, one. and Robert
K. Heimann, former managing editor and' later executive
editor of Fbrbes Magazine, tells it at length in Tobacco
and Americans, just published by McGraw-Hill.
Spanning the period from the days of CoJtambus to the
filter tips of today, Hieimann cites the Age of Faplorationn
as turning up four major stimulantS: Coffee, tea, chocolate
and tobacco.
"All were denounced as wicked because of, their
'heathen' origin," writes Heimann. "But while the tobacco
ritual was not' acceptable to Christian clerics as black
magic, tobacco medicine was acceptable to Christian apothe-
caries as brown magic. This was the wedge by which the
savage custom pried open the Old World market'."'
In outlining t'he,influence of tobacco on our nation's
economic growth and cultural development, Heimann says
"the history of' tobacco contains grist for the mill' of' the
sociolo;ist' as well as the economist, andi for the historian
as well as the agrieulturist."
Well illustrated and, enlivened with numerous anec-
dotes, Tobacco and Americans well may prove a volume
that a lot of folks around' these parts would walk a mile
for.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. W}-Divorced, separated

And, declared~ Dr: E. Cuyler Hammond, there's sms;-
gestive evidence this may •" recently on the market may
also be true for'menr prove to be ••safer" cigaretltes
This was one of, the findings
of a new survey of smoking
habits he said the ACS is con-
ducting, among more than a
million Americans.
For several years, the ACS'
has publici¢ed' lts view that
••excessive"' cigarette smoking
is the major contributing cause
of' cancer of the lung. The to-
bacco industry and some scien-
tists chal]enge this view, say-
ing there is no proof.
Hammond, addressing, a sem,
inar for science writers, reit-
erated that "it has been proved
beyond doubt" that excessive
cigarette smoking, is not only
the major contributory ofi lung
cancer but also Plays a, role
in a variety of other ills, in-
cluding coronary artery disease
and peptic ulcer.
But he also asserted that it
is conceivable that, whati he
called low-nicotine andl low-tar
cigarettes intri relatively
from the standpoint of' healt'h,
ha¢ardb,
"The lower the bettiec" should

Hammond said in a separate
interview.,He dhciared that pos-
sibly anything below one milli-
gram of nicotine in a aream of
smoke might be an aceept'abie
leveli
He said a few recently-intro•
duced brands contain nicotine
at only a seven-tenths of a mil-
ligram level. A few older
brands;, he said, contain be-'
tween 0.b~ and! 1.11 milligrams.
43,06i3 Replies
Concerning the smoking hab-
]ts survey-covering a sample
of 43:0ra8 questionnalires, from'
among those he said were an-
swered by more than a million
people in 25 states-Hammond
listed these among other fin&amp;
ings :
• A larger proportioni of, col-
lege graduates than those with
less education han•e giiven up
cigarette smoking since thee
lung cancer controversy. And a
large proportion smoke "•low=
tar; low-nicotine" cigarettes..
• The proportion of ex-ciga-
rette smokers and the propor-
tion of men smoking "low-tar,,
low-nicotine" cigarettes is high-
er among teachers: lawyem
clergymen, doctors. dentists
and veterinarians than in the
general' population.
Hammond, said, that while
cigarette consumption national-
ly has gone uip since the ACS
started sounding its lung can-
cer views jn 1954, his "impres-
sion"' is that the rise is due to
the following:
`Tt's not a matter of men
taking smoking, up more - be-
cause 11 think men tend tnn
smoke a little less thani they
did - but younger people
are taking it up more. That is,
people in their twenties, espe-
cially among women."

x-Wives Are Rated
By FRAINK CAREY'
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. W}-Divorced, separated

And, declared~ Dr: E. Cuyler Hammond, there's sms;-
gestive evidence this may •" recently on the market may
also be true for'menr prove to be ••safer" cigaretltes
This was one of, the findings
of a new survey of smoking
habits he said the ACS is con-
ducting, among more than a
million Americans.
For several years, the ACS'
has publici¢ed' lts view that
••excessive"' cigarette smoking
is the major contributing cause
of' cancer of the lung. The to-
bacco industry and some scien-
tists chal]enge this view, say-
ing there is no proof.
Hammond, addressing, a sem,
inar for science writers, reit-
erated that "it has been proved
beyond doubt" that excessive
cigarette smoking, is not only
the major contributory ofi lung
cancer but also Plays a, role
in a variety of other ills, in-
cluding coronary artery disease
and peptic ulcer.
But he also asserted that it
is conceivable that, whati he
called low-nicotine andl low-tar
cigarettes intri relatively
from the standpoint of' healt'h,
ha¢ardb,
"The lower the bettiec" should
he the rule of' nicotine content,
Hammond said in a separate
interview.,He dhciared that pos-
sibly anything below one milli-
gram of nicotine in a aream of
smoke might be an aceept'abie
leveli
He said a few recently-intro•
duced brands contain nicotine
at only a seven-tenths of a mil-
ligram level. A few older
brands;, he said, contain be-'
tween 0.b~ and! 1.11 milligrams.
43,06i3 Replies
Concerning the smoking hab-
]ts survey-covering a sample
of 43:0ra8 questionnalires, from'
among those he said were an-
swered by more than a million
people in 25 states-Hammond
listed these among other fin&amp;
ings :
• A larger proportioni of, col-
lege graduates than those with
less education han•e giiven up
cigarette smoking since thee
lung cancer controversy. And a
large proportion smoke "•low=
tar; low-nicotine" cigarettes..
• The proportion of ex-ciga-
rette smokers and the propor-
tion of men smoking "low-tar,,
low-nicotine" cigarettes is high-
er among teachers: lawyem
clergymen, doctors. dentists
and veterinarians than in the
general' population.
Hammond, said, that while
cigarette consumption national-
ly has gone uip since the ACS
started sounding its lung can-
cer views jn 1954, his "impres-
sion"' is that the rise is due to
the following:
`Tt's not a matter of men
taking smoking, up more - be-
cause 11 think men tend tnn
smoke a little less thani they
did - but younger people
are taking it up more. That is,
people in their twenties, espe-
cially among women."

VIRGINIA MAGAZINE OF HISTORY
AND BIOGRAPHY
October 1960

Irrstitttte of,'Farly American History and Culture
Tobacco and Americans. By ROBERT K. HtNCnTtN. New York: 11!IcGraw-Hilli Book
Company, Inc., r9bo. ii, 278 pp. $,7:50.
"TosAcco originated in America;, it was this nation's first business; Americans brought
it to its present stage of'development: The story of tobacco is somewhat more than aa
business history. It is, in many ways, the story of America itself." Thus endeth the
author's brief introduction to this, according to the publishers, "the most' complete and
authoritative treatment of the subject in~ print." And thus is illustrated! the aplomb with
which Mr. Heimann enters into his subject.
Handsomely bound, with an attractive tobacco colored dust jacket, andl containing
over three hundred fascinating illustrations, the book will catch the eye of many people
who are interested in tobacco,, the tobacco industry, and the history of tobacco. Here is
probably the finest publ'ashed collection of'sketclies and pictures relkting to the history,
cultivation„ processing, buying and selling of' the goldem weed. There are even illus-
trations showing how to "roll your own" which may be useful now that Virginia's tax
on packaged cigarettes has gone into effect.
' A brief "selected" bibliography lists the sources from which Heimann obtained his
irnfonsnation, They are almost all' secondary. Reference is made to J. E. Bropks" monu-
mental work on materials relating to tobacco in the Arents Collection, but the reader is
.left to guess whether or not the author has used any of the original' sources. There are
no footnotes. No explanation is made of any statements some of which are most extra-
ordinary and need darif cation. This weakness of the book will distress the serious
student, who wants to learn more about tobacco and its history.
Extravaganr claims andl broad generalities abound throughout the t,ext: The section on
Tidewater Virginia contains factual errors as welll misinterpretations. It is difficult to
believe, without proper documentation~ that the "noble savage"'Powhatan refrained from
wiping,out the "perfidious..., desperate English" at' Jamestown because he was "secure
in the esteem of his own people"' (p. 45). The treatment of the "Little Wanton" Poca•
hontas leaves much to be desired.
- High School students in Virginia know, if they have learned their lessons well, that
the Virginia Company charter was annulled in n6x4and that Virginia then became the
first royal colony. We are told here, however, in a discussion of Britishi mercantilism,
that in order "to protect the interests of the Virginia Company, Spain's leaf after, i,63z'
paid a duty of two shillings per pound as against ninepence paid by Virginia, leaf'
(p• 5T).
Bacon's Rebellion is dismissed with a few bold strokes as a"foretaste of the American
Rcvoliution." Again it is difficult to believe that, "had Bacon lived, the War of Inde-
pendence might have begun in 1676 instead' of 1776" (p. 57): Charles II is reported
to have said of Governor Berkeley, "That old fool has hung more men in that raw land
than I did for tlie death, of my father."' Here we have tlie vengeful Governor hanging
more men than died in the rebellion led by Bacon.
Even though there are some errors and a, great many generalities, there is much to
commend in this book besides the illlustrations. When tobacco businessman-sociologist
Heimann leaves the field of history and concentrates on the tobacco business with
emphasis on advertising he makes a reaI contribution. But a plague on his house for not
teiling us in footnotes where he got his iinformation..

Book Rev ievws
Tobacco and Arnericans. By Robert K. Heimann. (New York: Mc -
GraNS+-Hfll Company, Inc., 1980. Pp. 265. Illustrations, index.
Tlus work is more than a pretty picture book, but as editor, and
designer of the Nation's Heritage book series, the author has had
experience in this school. At the risk of being called pedantic this
reviewer dares to protest the use of such Time and tried witticisms as
"smokuai" for smoking and a"strazght chaw for the cast-iron javv."'
. It seems a sh'ame to clutter an otherwise good work with such phrases.
Trained as a sociologist, Mr. Heimann begins as a sociologist to
examine the relationship between Americans and tobacco "in a socio-
economic cross-section"' but soon becomes an outright historian. His
work is an~ excellent general account but' con'taiws some hazardous
statements. The profuse illustrations, well chosen and interesting,
suggest a generous subsidy from~ the tobacco industry. In the absence
of a comprehensive study of burley tobacco and in view of the forth-
coming study by Professor Jacob Price, it is perhaps too early for a
do$n'itive work on tobacco, although Mr. Heimann does much to
clarify the role of burley.
Perhaps the book's best feafiure is the account of' the tobacco plant
and its history from 1492 until John Rdlfe~'s experimentation. Tobacco
in all its manufactured forms receives accurate attention. The organi-
zation is roughly chronological, beginning with the European ex-
plorers and their reaction to the New World plant. From Rolfe's intro-
dliction of Nicotiana tabacum, found in South America, to the instal-
lation of elaborate research departments by the cigarette companies
of today, the story covers most phases of tlie industry-the expansion
di tobacco culture, transportation and sale of leaf, the importance of
burley,, and, the rise of manufacturing. Accompanying charts are excel-
lent and useful in showing, the rising', consumption of'tobacco. Those
interested in such items as tin tags and cigar store Indians will also
find much to, please them. Perhaps the work of fih e farnmer is slighted,
especially in his great effort to develop a co-operative marketing asso-
ciation during the 1920's.
-Mr. Heimann's publishers should be called to task for inadequate
editing and' proofreading which permits such errors as "liadi already
became" ('pp. ". 29 ), "Casa de Contracion"' (p. 101), and "Seville
the world's first' tobacco manufacturing capitol" (p. 203). This work
may not be a "hidden persuader," although it stresses the pleasure
to be derived from tobacco. On the other hand the author calls atten-
tion to the one hundred fifty million dollars spent' annually in adver-
tising tobacco products-a legitimate expense, to be sure..

~ Cigaret smoke may contain a wax-;ike chemical that

0,substances-one that acts to cause cancer and• another
p without whose "prorrlotion" the' first chemi+cal' could not

S
: In a paper read at the annual
meeting in Atlantic City of the
American Assn: for Cancer Re-
search, Dr. Wynder said yes-
terday the cancer-causing chem-
icals In cigaret smoke are
known as carcinogens.
, These chemicals, he said, are
stimulated Into deadly action
by a second group of, chemicals
known as "promoters." With-
out these, he said, the carciilo•
gens cannot causc cancer. `
: The third group he labelbd
anti-carcinogens and' said they
act' to block the cancer-causing
process.

said there rnight exist by filter-

The program included:

chemicals.
Use of additives to cause.

Adding the anti-carcinogenicc
chemicals.
eomplete burning of' the to,
bacce. The carcinogenic mate-
rials, he said, are the result of
incomplete burning of the to-
bacco.
5. Addin'g anti-carcinogenic
chemicals to cigarettes. •
Dr. Wynder't report was on
results obtainedi from rubbing
tobacco smoke rnnoentrFite and
concentrated automob+_le ex-
haust gases on the skiris of
thousands oflive mice'and then'
determining which substance
developed more' tumor&amp;
On some of his mice he first
rubbed' the carcinogens from
cigarette smoke. No tumors de-
veloped! Then he added the pro-
moters„and tumors called "pap-
Illomas" (which are not can-
c'erous) develop_ed. ___ .
Then he' took another set of
mice and treated their skins
with~ the auto exhaust gases.
Auto bxhaust (also believed to
be a lung cancer cause), he
said~ contained far greater
amounts of the carcinogenic
materiali than cigarette smoke..
However, Dr. Wynder found,
to his~surprise, that the exhaust'
produced far fewer tumors ,'
(judged in relation to the ciga-
ret'te snpke) than it's excessive
amount of' carcinogenic mate-
rial indicated it should. This he
attributed to a greater amount
of anti-carcinogenic material hi.
auto exhaust than in cigarettes.
Dr. Wynder's report of anti-
carcinogens-deliivered' for the
first time today-was confirmedd
by separate experiments done
at the University of Southern.
California by Drs. Hans L. Salk
and Paul Kotin, who reported
finding anti-carcinogenic mate-
rial in Los Angeles smog, which
contains a large amount of autb,
exhaust. .
2 Drugs C.ive' Hope
Earlier in the day, five re-
searchers searchers from Roswell Park
Memorial Inst7tute' in Buffalo,
reported hopeful use of thvo
drugs to combat aduanced' lung
cancer. Speaking for the' flvec,
Dr. Charles A. Ross, chief of
thoracic (chest) surgery, at the
institute said t'wenty, of forty-'
eight patients treated with the
new drugs underwent remis-
sions of the disease that last'edi
from two weeks to, a year and, a,
quarter„' the average being
three weeks in, the case of one
-drug and fourteen weeks in the
other. ' - The drugs, labeled AB-103
and AB.132, are in the family
called alkylating agents, as Is
nitrogen mustard, which is cur-
rently used in fighting cancer. .
Dr. Ross said the new drugs
offered hope because of the
high number of, patients who
responded to i the treatment.
It was used, he said, on three
patients in whom the cancer
had already spread to their
brains andi had paralyzed
them. Two of the three recov-
ered from their paralysis, were,'
able to walk and were released
from the hospital. The cancer,
he said, returned, however.
"These drugs are far from
being as effective as we want
them to be. They're certainly
not' cures, but maybe they show
we're on the right track," Dr.
Ross reported.

that' Mr: Heimann is occasionally
given, to the flat statement, as
when he includes early in the
book a simple assertion that
"Tobacco was the reason, for
Maryland's settlement, by George
Calvert and his sons." That is an
explanation which might not'
wholly satisfy historians who have
beenithinking that the reasons for.
I.M ra yland's settlement by the
ty:dverts were more varied and
porters, gradually gave way to
the so-called "American blend"
of' cigarette tobacco which„ he
says, has now become the stand-
ard of good tobacco in every part
of the world.'
The author wasi a financiall
writer, with special interests in
the tobacco trade for some years
before he himself entered the to-
bacco business. Thus he may be
said to "know"' tobacco. Mr. Hei-

obacco Industry
Big, Rich Book On
TOBACCO AND AMERICANS.
By Robert K. Heflnann. Mc-
Graw-Hill Book Co., Inc., New
York. 265 pp. ;7:50.rTorth Carolinians, becausee
tobacco is such a significant
factor in their own lives, are
well' aware of the leaf's over-all
itnportance to the Americann
economy:
They're not likely„ therefore,
to quarrel' with Robert Hei-
mann's thesis that the story of
tobacco is the story of' America
itself.
In his big, outsize and copious-
l;y illustrated new book, "To-
bacco and Americans," Hei-
mann points out "tobacco origt
inated in America; it was this
nation's first' business; Ameri-
cans brought it tb its present
stage of' development:"
Taking a sweeping' look at
the colorfull story behind'these
facts, he has come up with 1 a
fascinating book nearly every
contemporary American shouldd
find' of some interest.
Starting off withi Columbus,
who was given "certain dried
leaves" by the natives he en-
countered in the New World, hee
covers the whole anecdote-laden
history of the leaf, including,the
significant role of North Caro:
lina in general and Durham in
particular.
He explains the intleresting
early prejudice against the "be-
witching vegetable" as arising
from i mistaken ideas that its
use was closely allied with pa,
gan- religious worsbip,
He tells how James Madison
opposed the taxation of'tobacco
because it would deprive the
poorer citizens of gratification.
He reveals that the plant was
taken tb Europe only a genera-
tion or two after the New
World was discovered, was in
fact popularized by common
seamen soon after Columbus
first saw it..
He points out, though, that
initiall prejudice against the
leaf went so far as to enforce
the dea'th penalty on smokerss
in some parts of Europe.
It became a crop in North
Carolina when "the land! ofl tar,
pitch and pork"' was found to,
be ideally suited to its cultiHa-
Hon withAts poor sandy soil.
Heimann tells the Bull Dur-
ham story, too-how Confed-
erate and Yankee soldiers who
sampled Durham tobacco dur-
ing the Johnston surrender cre-
ated a demand and set this re-
gion on its way to the big to-
bacco center it continues to be
today.
He pays tribute to lthe Dukes
and! the Reynoldses-all the
North Carolina tobacco barons,
backing it up with numerous
pictures Durhamites will recog-
nize.
Cigarette machines, adver-
tising, all the significant
developments in the tobacco in-
dustry are handled, even thee
cancer scare.
Here Heimann takes the atti-
tude that it's all ridiculous. He
quotes the results of research
and concludes that it's all just
one more big try at making to-
bacco the whipping boy for ev-
erything:
It's a big, rich book-one no
North Carolinian at all interest,
ed in his heritage should pass
up.-T.E.

NICK8L IN TOBACCO
Researchers in Philadelphia
: ; Produce Tumors in Rats.
With Traces of' Metal

I By WALTER SULLIVAN
Researchers at Jefferson Med-
ical College in Philadelphia have
::` found sufficient nickel in cig-
arette smoke to lead them to
believe that metal may produce
lung, cancer in smokers..
During the study, rats given
whiffs of' air with a trace of
nickel in it three times a week
for a year developed cancer.
Their total.nickel intake was
less than half that of a person
smoking two packs a day ac-
eording to the experimenters.
The research, supported in
part by the Atomic Energy .
Commission, Is reported in this
month's issue of The American
Journal of Cliniical, Pathology.
The researchers recommend
that an effort be made to
eliminate nickel vapors from
tobacco smoke. The researchers
were Dr. F. William Sunder-
man, director of the division of ~
metabolic research and clinical
'
professor of medicine, and' Dr.
F- William Sunderman Jr. ;
Their interest in nickel was
aroused by the powerful cancer-

The traditional smoke-filled conierences which will

The ancient Mayans used to smoke fat cigars at
their political councils. Incidentally, etymoiogists
claim the Mayans called them "zikars" and neither
the object nor the word has changed much in the past
1,000 years.
Tobacco, which Sir Wal-

inated in America and has
been part of our social
matrix ever since. It was
our first cash crop, and
Virginia, Maryland and
the other colonies existed
on a tobacco economy.

wasn't much of a smoker.
He happened to have a ci-
ga r in his mouth w h e n
n e•w s p a p e r men inter-
viewed him right after
the fall of Vicksburg and
was plagued by cigar
donors the rest of his life.)
The first man to write
about tobacco was ColumL
bus himself, who told of
being met b_ y natives who
presented him and his
men w i t h"certain dried
leaves." His sailors threw
the stuff away, although
one of them, Luis de Tor-
res, iate'r became the first .
confirmed European to-
bacco smoker.
When Patrick Henry
said "Give me liberty or
give me death!" it w a s
during a heated debate on
the tobacco tax question.
Washington and Jefferson
were both big tobacco
planters and during the
terrible winter at Valley
Forge Washington im-
pl~ored the public to do-
nate tobacco to his troops.
AT ONE TIME or an-

Indians were smoking, chewing and sniffir ;
`'tobacco long before America was disturbed bv vi:si*
tors from acrossi the Atlantic. In village sitps ex-
; cavated here during the 1930s by the State His-
torical Commission, some of the earliest st!ranght
pipes-estimated as more than 1.000 years old-
were dug up in Lancaster County. The late Dr. Don-
ald A. Cadzow put together a$eries illustrating how
the pipe evolved from the 'cigar-holder" type in
whichidriied leaves were apparently rolled and st'uffr
ed, to the ever more sharply upcurved bowl which
could hold ground or powdered tobacco: Some were
made crudely of clay; others of carved stone. From
trading days, there came scores of clay and terra
cotta pipes for which the Indians bartered furs and
foods.
"Tobacco And' Americans" tells how the white
man brought tobacco seed frorn, Central America
which replaceri the heavier, stronger leaf cultn-
vated by North American Indians. As soon as the
white man began to grow this, the Indian aband-
oned his o!wn tobacco culture, and'soon1was trading
for both tobacco and pipes. This is understandablle,,
since it was in the savage custom tiolmix his harsh
tobacco with, sumac or willow bark for smoking.
"SHOE-STRING" STbG'fES' -
Tobacco culture hereabouts lagged far behind
that of' tidewater farms, in volume and, valtae.
Manufacturing of' cigars in Philadelphia and' New
York began around the time of the Revolution. The
home-made cigar which was hauled west' in Cones-
toga, wagons andi became known as the stogie was
th~eni made, from'"shoe-string" leaf, thesarne
stringy and strong tobacco theni cultivated in Con-
necticut. This was far different from the much
superior leaf developed' in both areas later. Re-
search on tobacco in Lancaster County is as old as
1893,, when the legislature appropriated about $'2;A00
for this purpose. That original grant led to the 88-
acre research farm near Landisville which today
tests~ rnt only tobacco, bL l field:I crops, vegetables,
hay, soils, etc.
The cigar. writ-: •`lingered' on the
fringe of smrjke:,s' consciriusness for fiftw years "
(1762-18110) and took another fifty years (1810:-18&amp;0)
to develop momentum as an accepted formL For
stilll another fifty years cigars remained, supreme,,
reaching their peak in 1907; thereafter they fell'
off gently to the status of a secondary formL" Since
the early 1930s, cigars have apparently moved
along oni a sort of plateau, doing comparatively
better than plug and pipe smoking. And snuff,
apparently a substitute for the "chaw" rather than
something sniffed off the back of the hand, has been
holding its own for a similar term.
Trends are amply demonstrated in the decline
in the number of cigar manufactories, from 10,800
in 1925 to 1,200 in 1955, and 600 in 1958, The cigar
factories which dbtted Lancaster and York Coun6iies
have been concentrated into the efficient, modern,
plants of big companies where the accent is onn
reconstituted leaf. The boak pakes no predictions
of where the cigar industry is going from here-but
it provides a fascinating view of where it has been,
together withi the rest' of the story of tobacco from
its beginnings down ta the latest developments in
the controversy over the weed, and lung cancer.
This last, the author suggests, will pass into the
history of tobacco together with the many other
tribulations it' has survived. After all. tobacco was
being hailed by some European medical men 300
years ago as ai cure for almost every known ill.

New Book Tells Story
Of Mistory of Tobacco
Tj1e;,role oi',tnbacaeo, in Ameri-
can society is the subject' of' a
beautifully produced book, "To-
bacco and Americans" by R.obert
K. Heimann (McGi•a.~w-Hi1l Book
Co., hTew York, $7.54)1. _ ., _.,
. This book tells the story of to-
bacco from its very earliest days
to the present day world, of sci-
entific filters and mentholated
t~ cigarettes. The rise and decline
Q of snuff'and!chewingtobacco, the
~ birth of'the cigarette, the history
\ of the important tobacco firms,
and much. much more can be.
found' in this handsome book. .:.
Perhaps the most enjoyable
feature of' "Tobacco and, Ameri-
cans" is that it is profusely i12us-
trated from beginning to end.
Al1-in all it is an attractive and'
informative addition to the li-
brary of anyone interested in t'o-
bacco- and in American life for,
aq this book proves, the two can-
not be separated.
rr;
I have not had time to db anything but browse ;
. through the pages, it is a very impressive looking '
volume. Published by McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc. ``
According to the jacket flap, the book is a history
of tobacco from the first explorer's discovery to the
, present day giant industry. The book is magnaficent-
~ ly illustrated.

Robert Karl Heimann earned his undergraduat'ee
degree at Princeton and' his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees
in sociology at' New York University. He was editor
and designer of the "Nation's Heritage" book series,
and later managing editor of a leading financial'
magazine. He cani be said to know tobacco inside and
out, for as a financial writer he specialized in the
tobacco iridustry and ultimately entered the tobacco
business, with which he has been associated for
many years. Thus he brings to his subject qualifica-'
tions as a historian, social scientist, ai::_ tobaccoman.
Even on first glance, may I recommend
to
_
everyone connected with the industry "Tobacco &amp;•
Americans": I feel sure you will iindl it worthwhole.

GARCIA: "Hello, this`is Nan Garcia, and today we're happy to
welcome to the microphone Mr. Robert K. Heimann, author of a very inter-
esting,book called 'Tobacco and Americans'."

GARCIA: "Youlhave some magnificent pictures in your book, and I

I guess Columbus when he first came to the Indies was given tobacco as a
gift from the Indians, wasn't he?"'

HRIMAIVN: "Yes, as a matter of fact he was. He didn't know what

he was getting any more than he knew what he was getting into, but
tobacco had been used in almost all the forms we know today for hundreds

. and hundreds of years, nearly a thousand years in fact before Columbus
even arrived."
GARCIA: "And what they gave him -- what was it? 'certain dried

leaves"?"

GARCIA: "And wasnrt it George Washzngton who said when he was

trying tolcollect money for the army that if you can't send money, send,

'-tobacco? " . ._ - . .-

cal Leaf Industry In Mid'st' of Changes,
ut History Shows It's Happened Before


Tobacco leaves whisper an oldl6ong to the,No-
vember wind' as they hang drying in the sheds.
Their rich brown color is the same as always„ and
the heady scent that wafts through the opened
barn-slats has not altered for generations.
But the unchanged look and smelli of the 1960
.
crop are deceiving, for things are not the same for
the fragrant leaf so long identified with this section,
of Pennsylvania. Farmers who rub the silkenleaves
between, thumb and finger are thinking not just
about the buyers who will descend upon the strip•
ping rooms one of:these days witti an eye for a fine,
crop and!a hope to bid it in as cheaply as possible.
They will be wondering about the Havana leaf that
_ is not coming from Castro's Cuba, to bind local,
- cigartobaceol about'the new processes to eliminate
the lbng hours of suckering, harvesting, stripping,
'" and packing the,leaf; about the reconstitutedl or
:,homogeniaed tobacco whichiis reeling,off production
lines like great rolls of brown butctier-paper.
REVOLUTION IN PROCESS
The revolution of reconstituted tobacco is here.
I The other revolutions-of chemical sucker deter-
rents, of mechanical cutters;, of shredders which,
aun Lb eiiminate entirelu the hanging,up of: the
plants in ventilated sheds-these are in various
stages of'develbpment:.
Tb the embattled fan„er; it may be a relief to
learn that'the history of tobacco h2s been filledlwith
such baffling evolutions. Much of the story is
told in a big and handsome book called "Tobacco
And Anericans,"' (MeGraw-Hill, $7~50) by Robert
K. Heimann, a sociologist and editor of a leading
financial'magaLine: Though cigars are only part of
a historic panorama which focuses alternately on
pipe and plug, snuff and cigarette, it: has supplied
much,in:the way of interesting tobacco fact and
legend.
The book,has the,distinction of having been re-
eordeid on magnetic tape by the Library of Con-
gress for free use by blind people throughout'the
country. Tobacco as money, tobacco as a medium
. of exchange for servant girls brought from London
to Virginia, tobacco as the lever which liftedl']toom-
as Jefferson into sending Lewis &amp; Clark to the west,
tobacco as the power behind Tennessee,and Ken+
tucky in their pressure on New Orleans toward the
Louisiana purchase-these are only samplings of'
the facts large and small available in the book.
GRANT HELPED T~HE' C16ARINDWSTiRY
'
Here is the land whose proud Conestoga wagon
gave an abbreviated' name to the villainous old,
stogie, the many people involved in, the tbbaceo,
business will find fascinating,facts on nearly every
page; as well as a superb selection of hundreds of'
illustrations Three of them feature a President of'
the: United States well remembered in Lancaster
County-U. $~,Grant. He paid a number of visits to
friend~ in Marietta during, his term in office: To
cigar men, he is remembered as the President who
inade the brown roll respectable and, popular.
One drawing,of GranGshows him with cigar in
hand, another puffing out a great cloud of smoke,
with the caption; "The General's resource in any
emergency-smoke"; a thirdlwith Hayes and Butler
in an adifor a 5 cent "segar."
Other earlier Americans who visited here had
their part ini the history, of tobacco, tooi , George
Washington was the largest planter of the leaf in
America. Robert Morris, banker of the Revolution,
who fled withihis family from Philadelphia to Man-
heim when, the British moved in, was later de-
nouncedlwhen he tried to buy leaf at half-price as
agent for the French tobacco trust in 1785.
DR. RAJSH' DISSENTED
One of the founders of Franklini College, now.
Franklin &amp;,Marshall, in 1798'attacked the smoking
and chewing of'tobacco as exciting a desire for
strong drinks. -And, said' Dr. Benjamin Rush of
Philadelphia, "these when takeni between meals
soon lead to intemperance and drunkenness." He
had followed the lead takeniin 1604 by King,James I
of England in his famous "Counterblaste to Tobac-
co,"' in which the emperor declared smoking to be
"loathesome to the eye, hateful toi the nose, harme-
full to the brain. dangerous to the lungs."'

tance; that it has not had more of the
same.
In the New York Public Library is the
extraordinary Arents Collection of mater-
. lals pertaining to the subject. Jerome E.
'; Brooks has written a, good general account
,,: of tobacco. So has Joseph, C. Robert, form-
er president of' Hampden-Sydney College,
who also made a, careful study of the ante-
. bellum tobacco kingdom. 11?annie M. Tilley
haa traced the development of bright to-
bacco in detail, and!there have been spec_
ial studies and industry publications. Still,
the field has not been overworked.
Tbe present volume seeks to present a
comprehensive and definitir,'e story of to-
bacco in all of its aspects-cultivation,
marketing, manufacturing, •changing tastes
and products, advertising methods;, ~tc.-
against a setting of' general' hiRtory, ever
since Columbus discovered It along with
America and the earliest sailors introduc_
ed it to Europe. Raleigh, It might be noted,
made smoking stylish in the best circles
but did not introduce the custorn, to Eng-
land ,
"The story of I tobacco," says the author,
"is somewhat more than a business hia-
tory. It is, in many ways, the story of
America, itself. " .
This is no exaggeration. John Rolfe's
1813 development of a mild strain i of hlico-
tiana tabacum - today it would be "ship-
ping, leaf4"' not' suitab7e for use in, the
United States , supplied a-much needed
economic base for the Virginia colony. To-
bacco figured in many of' the issues and
incidents leading to American lndepen,
dence. The Virginia campaign of 1781 was
a "tobacco war." And the leaf played its
part in the -westward movement and in
the affairs,pf many of the nation's leading
sfatesmen.
Today as ini its earliest days, Peters-
burg is part of the tobacco story. The pres-
ent volume lists Petersburg, Richmond,
Lynchburg, and Danville as centers of, the
plug'industry before 1860. During,the 1880's,
when manufacture had' come to be marked
by large volume and small profits and the
"big, tlen"' dominated the industry, S. W.
Venable; of Petersburg, was still one of
the sturdy independents.
The history of tobacco being what it is,
"Tobacco and Americans"' abounds in
quaint and curious lore: It is pretty well
known that through the years it has been
pronounced both cure and cause for every
known, ailment. James I; "the wisest fool in
Cliristendom,'; made perhaps the most bit-
ter attack on it:
James Madison opposed taxing tobacco
on the ground that the tax would serve to
deprive the poor of ' innocent gratification,
but Mr. Madison's logic has not prevailed.
Today Afierican cigerette tobacco is taxed
at $1.43 per pound by the federal govern-
ment, by many states on the average of
60 cents per pound, and by many cities
another 17 cents per pound. So tobacco
which se11s for 60 cenEs a pound in leaf
form, returns three to four times t h a.t
amount to tax authorities.
The volume succeeds in its attempt to
be definitive. Not all of' the details could
be compressed in any one volume, but the
wonder is that' so much factual material
can be combined I in one account. The vo1L
ume is handsomely illustrated. Chronolo-
gy, bibliography, and, index add to its use-
fulness for reference.

HE IMPCRTAhT'T' ROLE' that tobacco has
played in~ the history and lives of' Americans
is presented' in this 278-page volume. The book
is well organazed, profusely illustrated, and en-
gagingly written. The author has adoanced
degrees in~ sociology, has been a financial editor,
and, for several'_ years, has _ been with ~a : large.
- tobacco-manufacturing company. He knows t'o-
, bacco history very well, and his training in
y soeiology undoubtedly contributed much to this
~
;,
balanced and interesting account of' the way to-
. bacco has been intertwined with the lives of Amer-
. ic.ans for the last 450 years.
The first of the eight chapters in the book gives
an account of' the discoveries of tobacco by Eu-

~ ropeans during, the voyages and egplbrations of
Columbus, Thevet, Verrazano, Hawkins, and
ot'liers. Following thisi the author carries us
through the early Spanish, French, Dutch, and
Ehglish rivalries in the New World and high-
lights the early uses of tobacco in Europe in those
, times. The ma jor role played by tobacco in the
economies of the English colonies of' Virginia,
. Maryland, and! Carolina is then developed.
Great figures in early American history appear-
Patrick Henry, George Washington, Thomas Jef-
fersony James Madison, and others-as they move
toward establishing a new nation. Tobacco in
one way or another impinged significantly on the
lives of many well-known leaders in the Revolu-
tionary period'L
Gl'hapter four tells about tobacco in New Ehg-
land from the early period of the Yankee traders.
Much of this chapter is devoted to the early de-
velopment of the cigar and its big gain, in popu-
larity in the 19th century. Next, the author
traces the part played by tobacco as the Nation
grew westward "across the Appalachians"-the
new producing areas in Kentucky and Tennes-
see-and the large consumption of tobacco in the
formi of' chewing products. We then follow to-
McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York.
:1960. $7.50

~ bacco through t'he Civil War period and its ~~:
commercial revival following the conflict.
'' The author traces the story of the tobacco in-
diustry in Now York City from New Amsterdam
- to the i beginnings of'the cigarette era, and we are
brought into this century to see the fascinating
growth of the modern. cigarette industry. The
- triumph of the Aanerican blended cigarette, the
rivalries of'the brand's, the part played by tobacco
in the two World Wars„theGowernmentprogram
of crop co:ntrol,,the advent of filter tipsi and! other
related topics are touched upon. There are 10 clear charts showing consumption
of the various tobacco prodiuets,, burley tobacco
leaf prices, tages collected on tobacco products,
and total eaports of leaf tobacco over a long span ,t
of years. Only a few minor errors in the author's
sparing, use of statistics in the narrative were
noted by this reviewer.
This volume contains some shrewd observations
on the economic aspects of tobacco throughout-its
long history. The author also has some pertimentt
comments on present'-day economics of the tobaccm-
industry. Most students and observers of the to~
bacco industry will agree with the interpretations.
made on most counts. - But the treatment ac+
corded the crop-controli program has the t'imge of'
the tobacco buyers' slant and' tends to glbss over
the difficult problems that have confrontedi the
"600,000 tobacco growers of this country.
A splendiid feature of the book is the remark-
able collection of ildustrations,, including both re-
productiorns of photographs and sketches, which
number about 300. They occupy parts of nearly
every page and, together with, the fine writing
style of the author, make this an interesting, book
for anyone who ~ has even the sl'aghtest' interest in
tobacco and its history. Finally, a detailed index
contributes significantly toward making the vol~ ~
ume one of'last'ing usefulhess.

..-Louisviille, Kentucky
Jnzne 27, -1960
A Review by ALBERT C. ALLEN, Times News Edifor
Where there's smoke, there's controversy.
"A vile and' stinking custome," wrote Eng-
land's James I about tobacco, "loathsome to
the eye, hateful to the nose, harmefull to the
braine, dangerous toitlhe lungs: ..."
"The holy herb." gushed' Damflao de Goes,
a Portuguese historian in 1571, "because of its
powerful virtue in wonderful ways ... prin-
cipaliy in d!e s p e r a t e cases: for ulceratedi
abscesses, fistuals, sores, inveterate polyps and''
many other ailments." -
--Fbur hundred years later the battle still
rages, having, lost none of its bitterness and'
littleof its wild enrthusiasmmeantivhile. Only
f
theiieldl of battle has shifted, from sores,
fistuQas and the "braine"'tw lung,cancer.
A reader expecting tb find in Robert K.
Heimann's Tobacco and Americans a full airing
of this and the many other controversies-
moral and medical-that have swirled around
tobacco over the years will' be disappointed.
For this big, handsome, book makes no pre-
trnse of' objectivity; it is unabashedly on the
side of de Cues; its author obviously convinced
of'the holiness of the herb:
So enthusiastic is• Heimann that he permits
this otherwise excellent history of tobacco in
America to pooh-pooh smoking's current med-
ical'challenge and by juxt'aposition with earlier
wild-eyed attacks on the smoking habit ("'itt
induces moustaches on, ladies' lips; increases
the population of insane asylums; sterilizes
men") he seeks to put them all on the same
plane of implausibility:
Heimann ignores the statistical evidence
against his side, though he carefully marshals
his own statistics to show that smoking neverr
harmed anyone. He even goes so far as to at-
tribute the current' popularity of filter-tips ta
an "attenuation of American taste "' rather
than face up to the obvious facts..
All'this is not toisay that Tobacco and,Amer-
icans goes at all deeply into medical chal-
lenges, past or present. On the contrary, it
touches on this only lightly, focusing atten-
tion instead' on the tobacco habit in all its shift-
ing forms and, the industry that supplies it.
It's an absorbing story that Heimann tells:
Tobacco's starture-semi-sacred-among the In-
dians . . . its introduction to Columbus„ who
wrote of the natives who gave him "certain
dried leaves" ... its spread, first through
sailors, then to colonists untali it emerged! an
important crop in the Spanish settlements ...
growth in America in the face of British mer-
cantilism with all its injustices ... independ-
ence andl ttje growth of' new forms: cigar and
plug ... tobacco's march westward as the
nation grows, leaping the mountains andi setr
tling down as burley culture in the "`'V'est" ...
t e rise of Louisville and St. Louis as plug-
m9tiingeenters...•the great Bull Durham,
propelled into fame and fortune by aniaccident'
of' war ... the horde of copy-cat brands ...
cigarettes shake off the taint of effeminacy and
overwhelm the older uses of tobacco .
The Savor Of' Brand Names
Heimann has a strong feel for the historic
importance of' his subject, and the riehness of
the detaili he supplies testifaes to the care
which, went' into his research. Unlike many
historians, he can savor the humor in an his-
toric situation; for example, he is obviously
fascinated, as anyone must be, with, the wildlyy
improbable brand names that were tackedl onto
chewing tobacco in an effort to have something
for everyone. National Tobacco Works of
Louisville had' Blattle Ax, the most famous, and
hJewsboy. But it also produced Lie Quid and
Monkey Wrench Plug: Another Louisville
firm., Pfingst, Doerhoefer &amp; Company, had a
Piper Heidsieck. But from elsewhere came
Little Swan Rough and Ready, It's Naughiy.
But Oh How Nice, Ring Cbi1' Hot Cake. Old
Brick, Jaw Bone, Honey Suckle, Mountain Dew,
Old Silug;, IVLule Ear and, for a market that can
only be imagined, Darling Fanny Pan Cake.
Backing, up Heimann's scholarship is an ar-
ray of illustrations ranging from photios of
Aztec and blayan stone caivings showing the
uses of tobacco through old' woodcuts of colo•
nial tobaccv culture; Currier and INes liithoi

Tobacco-From Plug to Filter Tip
By MARSH MASLIN
FR4M' Robert K. Heimann'q "Tobacco

more about tobacco-cigars, cigarets,
snuffand p1Ltg-tham he though was pos-
sible or available in any book. It's big and
handsome with a tobacco - brown cover
and more than 300 il'hns-
tratiions - drawings, car-
toons, reproductions of ad-
vertisements and photo•
graphs-about a product
that has caused more
pleasure andi controversy
than almost anv other.
The on1-,- monarch whn
ever fulminated against
the weed was King .Iainnc:
the First of Engl'and who nti'H SLis
issued a "Counterblast Against Tobacco"
and could do nothing, to affect its popu-
larity.
Astounding Fashion
But as far back as 1627 a German aun-
bassador to the Dutch protested against
"the astound'ing fashion lately introducedl
from America" ancll said of the Dutchi
that "these madmeni swallow and inhale
with incredible eagerness the smoke of a
plant they call Herba Nicotiana, or to-
bacco." . . . In this country, even, Gover-
nor Kieft of New Amsterdam (New York)
forbade all smoking in public in 11639 but
nobody obeyed ham.
As everybody knows, the white men
who discovered this hemisphere found its
inbabitsnts smoking and at once took up,
the habit, except' the Puritans who ab-
stained at first because they heldi that
any Indian habit was paganish and vile.

"Tobacco, originated in America; it was
the nation's first business; Americans
brought ib to its present stage of develiop-
ment. The storv of tobacco is somewhat
more thani a bu:siness history. It is,, in
manv wavr, the story of America itself."
That last sentence may he stretching
the facts a iittlie, but Mr. Heirnann sharp-
ens his point with many illustrations.
"Sernd Tobacco"
Afiteralll when, George Washington
was cl-ying for support of his troops, he
plt'aded: If vou cati't send' money, send
tobacco."' When Lewis and Clarke made
their famious trekacrors 4merica, they
greased their way with gifts of tobacco
to the Indians, so generously that on
their return they had no tobacco for
themselves.
Tobacco stores became so numerous
in the last half of the 19th century that
there were more wooden Indians in front
of them than there were living Indlians
in the land. Chetvingtobaeco was so pop-
ular in the I890's that 29 million pounds
of plug were sold! each year; there were
spittoons and cuspidors in, every home,.
and they might be there still if the
women hadn't made such a fuss.
The growth of t1?e industl~v has tieeni
tremendous and it is difficult to say
what its next step will be. The Browser

More fascinating even than its

the weed and its transition with
changing public tastes. The Indians
used to smoke it mixed wathisumac

At firstt men rolled the leaves in
a, crude cigar or powdered it for
stirffing intio, the bowl of' a, pipe
.made of'a gourd;, clay or the lowly
corncob. Pioneer backwoodsmen
sweetenedi it with molasses and
chewed it, calling it many things,
including "mule harness"' or just,
plin "chawing, 'baccy." The cigar
came back with post-Civili War
prosperity and the 20th Century
brought the cigarette. With all these
changes the pipe never lost its sup+
porters.
Virginians bought servant girls in
London with tobacco. Frontiers-

, :;
men used it to beg or bribe land'
and other valuables from the
Indians. The Confederates used at
to purchase muskets in Europe.
Even during, the War between the
States, Rebel soldiers traded it forr
food and coffee, which their richer
adversaries had in plenty.
_
In this jet-propelled, atomic age,
tobacco is stiili the base of one of'
the greatest industries in the nation.
Mr. Heimann has told its story in
a whale of a book, rich with hun-
dreds of illustrations. My copy is
already browned with pipe smoke

New Book Tells Story
Of Mistory of Tobacco
Tj1e;,role oi',tnbacaeo, in Ameri-
can society is the subject' of' a
beautifully produced book, "To-
bacco and Americans" by R.obert
K. Heimann (McGi•a.~w-Hi1l Book
Co., hTew York, $7.54)1. _ ., _.,
. This book tells the story of to-
bacco from its very earliest days
to the present day world, of sci-
entific filters and mentholated
t~ cigarettes. The rise and decline
Q of snuff'and!chewingtobacco, the
~ birth of'the cigarette, the history
\ of the important tobacco firms,
and much. much more can be.
found' in this handsome book. .:.
Perhaps the most enjoyable
feature of' "Tobacco and, Ameri-
cans" is that it is profusely i12us-
trated from beginning to end.
Al1-in all it is an attractive and'
informative addition to the li-
brary of anyone interested in t'o-
bacco- and in American life for,
aq this book proves, the two can-
not be separated.
rr;
I have not had time to db anything but browse ;
. through the pages, it is a very impressive looking '
volume. Published by McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc. ``
According to the jacket flap, the book is a history
of tobacco from the first explorer's discovery to the
, present day giant industry. The book is magnaficent-
~ ly illustrated.

Robert Karl Heimann earned his undergraduat'ee
degree at Princeton and' his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees
in sociology at' New York University. He was editor
and designer of the "Nation's Heritage" book series,
and later managing editor of a leading financial'
magazine. He cani be said to know tobacco inside and
out, for as a financial writer he specialized in the
tobacco iridustry and ultimately entered the tobacco
business, with which he has been associated for
many years. Thus he brings to his subject qualifica-'
tions as a historian, social scientist, ai::_ tobaccoman.
Even on first glance, may I recommend
to
_
everyone connected with the industry "Tobacco &amp;•
Americans": I feel sure you will iindl it worthwhole.

countrymen for aid: "I say, if

General' MacArthur to ask what
his troops needed most. "The
entire amount," he replied';
"should be used to purchase
American cigarettes."'
In its long history tobacco has
been used in many forms. Chew-
ing, dipping, pipe-smoking, roll=

"should be used to purchase
American cigarettes."'
In its long history tobacco has
been used in many forms. Chew-
ing, dipping, pipe-smoking, roll=
ing your own - each; with in•
finite variations, has had its
day. In the UJnited' States chew-
ing tobacco consumption hit its
peak in 1890; cigar consumption,n
in 1907; smoking tobacco, 1910.
What Comes Next?
Today's dominant form, the
cigarette, took the lead in 1921„
eight' years after Reynolds in-
trodueed the first blended brand'
Camel. The cigarette macnine
actually had been invented at
Durham 30 years before Camell
made its appearance; but the
cigarette had'to wait for its day
until America become largely a
"cit5fied"' nation. Cigarettes fit
better than pipes or cigars into
the urban scene; they are con-

When Christopher Columbus
first reached' the shores of the
new world, he was offered a
smoke. Such a gesture has been
a mark of hospitality since, as
natural as breathing.
This massive and' luxuriously
bound' tome is a status symbol
for any serious Southerner's
library. More than that, it is
the story of' a way of life of a
people - an&amp; the poople are
South, Carolinians - from thee
port cities t~oTobaccoland in the
Pee Dee.
The story of these "certain
dried leaves" that' Columbus. Sir
Walter Raleigh and countless
others have found to be such an
enjoyable tranquillizer is fasci-
nating. It' is told here in de-
tail: from the simple inhalation
of fumes to the pipe: from
"eating tobacco" to snuff: fromm
rope twist5 to the finest Havan+
nas; from Bull Durham "roll+
your-owns" to the dodbie-filtered
filters.
The book also proves that
there is nothing, riew under the
sun. In the 19th Century, filter
tips were available, and, like a
new, brand heralded only days
ago, Dr. Scott's "Electric Ciga-,

GEORGE V. ALLEN,
president, The To+
bacco Institute Inc..
Washingtonj, D.C.
I look forward with confidence to
196L
The primary basis for this conjecture
is not what the new Administration in.
Washington will' or will not' do-it is
baFedi on confidenee in, the dynamism
of America and American industry.
Any industry that serves a$enuine
public demandi willff continue to thrive,
no matter what, attitudes this or that
adtninistration may take.
The tobacco industry is the best case
in point that I know.
From its beginning at Jamestown
three and one-half centuries ago, to-
ba--co immediately proved itself vital
: to the growth, and even isurvival; of the
colonies. Since that time its products
have been in contfinued'and inereasing,
demand;, world-wide. Today the to-
bacco industry, which ranks among the
most stable andl progressive elements
in our economy, is entering', a new eraa
of' steady expansion.
I cite tobacco because it has had
more than its share of obstacles through
the years.
This continued growth during 350
years has occurred despite the fact that
tobacco products have been subjected
to attack and have been legislated,
against from time to time from the
days of King James I to the present
day. They have carried an increas-
ingly severe rate of'taxation.
Yet we look forward to the future
with confidence because we answer a
legitimate and growing public demand
with a product based on scientific and
marketing research of a high order.
For t;hose apprehensive about Wash-
ington in 1961, I' point to the naming
of' Luther Hodges as Secretary of Com-
merce as a, reason for confidence.
No "pendulum thinker"
Here is a businessman and a public
servant who has stood the tests, and
who typifies the dynamism I have men-
tioned. He believes, for example, in
a, two-way street' for international busi-
ness investment. To mention my own
industry again, be comes from a to-
bacco state and is aware that tobacco
bridges the dbilar gap about as well as
anything,we produce.
American business is often subject'
to "pendulum thinking"-swinging', be-
tween the extremes of confidence and
worry. The tobacco industry, starting,
wtih John Rolfe at Jamestown, has
learned to be stout-hearted:

the whole history of man's great' solace
ranges from the primitive usA of smoke

The illustrations,-many of them

arena.
However, "authorities" on the subject fre-
quently point out that, "Every cigarette smoker
will, di e: of lung, cancer if he doesn't die of' somd-
thing else first." This is the kind of statementt
that causes chaos and confusionL
On the surface, it looks like the final verdict.
It has considerable impact and it's true-ab-
solUtely true. It also implies. an ipso facto re-
lationship between smoking and lung cancer.
Fact is, it's enough to make many a true tobacco
Iover banish the weed for life.
But like so many "impact" statements, it's
absolutely meaningless. Even if you, don't smoke,
you'll die of lung cancer if you don't die of some-
thing else first. The proposition rules out all
other means of shucking off this mortal coil and
leaves only two alternatives. We must either (1)
die of lung cancer or (2) live forever.
It's just as factual (and meaningful) to say
that anyone who plays golf will die of syphilis if
he doesn't die of' somet'hing else first-or that
anyone who drinks bourbon will die of ingrown
toenails if no other cause of death intervenes.
We're alll for intelligent debate but let's keep.
it in the realm of reason.

CANCER:


Clue to the Killer?


~ In their constant search for the causes
of lung cancer, researchers have ex-
aminedl virus infections, heavy cigarette
smoking, and air pollution. Last week,
their attention waa-darected to still
another factor-tubenculosis.
Wiiting in the journall of' the American
Medical Associationj Drs. Broda Q:
Barnes of Denver, Colo:, and Max
Ratzenhoferi of' Grax, Austria, reported
that scores of patients were surviving
tuberculosis early in life only to contract
lung Qancer in later years. As collabora-
tors on this paper, the two lung, special-
ists based their conclusions on more tlhan.
20;000 autopsies performed at the Uni-
versity of Graz, indicating that in a largee
number of' cases, the two diseases had
"competed for the same person, tubercu-
losis at aw early age, and cancer as hee
grew older."
These results are confirmed in a see-
ondl report by a Swedish scientist, Dr.
Alf Westergren, who examined 1i00 11ung,
cancer victims and found tuberculosis
scars in the chests of one-third of them.
"Accumulating evidence, both in Eu+•
rope and America, suggests that scars left
by tubercular infection, or other lung
damage, may in later years become the
site of lung cancer," conciudes an article
in The Cancer Bulletin of' the :lmerican
Cancpr Society. "To avoid lung cancer
in oldl age, the cured TB patient must
exercise constant vigilance; he musE
have regUlur lung X rays to detect the-
earliest sigris of' malignancy."'

To Ir"D Decline.


A decline' in deaths due to tuberculosis •has been sug

ftested as a factor in the increasing occurrence of lung,'
cancer.
: Writing in~ the Jou,rnal of the American Medical Aasa
ciation, -Drs. - Broda O. -Bat•nes and Max Ratsenhoffer
said.more persons were surviving TB early In life only too
contract lung cancer In their later years:. ...
-They predicted' t'hat' "a large increase"-In`lung cancer.
could be expected as tuberculosis deaths continue to
decline., :
Their conclusions."were-.based on data from 26;SAI6
, autopsies performed during the past 1'S' years at the: Uni•
versity of Graz, Austria..
:' The study showed that "g 'great reduct'ion in . tuber-
ciilosi's Is occurring lia Graz, as eisewhere."' Lt also showed
that the average age of' patients whd 'died fnom tuber-
culosis was rising.
°In l'9K the average age at death was 39 years;.
while in 1957 it was 54 years," the aut'hors said. "Ini otherr
words; the tubercular patient was approacning tha" `cancer
age' before death." . .
A further indication was that TB.and! lung, cancer are,
not found' frequently in the saone person at the same
tirne. ~

It appears, they said;, "that there are two dieeaaea
corrtpeting .for the same personr tuberculosis at nn early
age and bronchogenic carcinoma as he grows olde :" P; "It' should be expected that' countripa with~a lttgh

, inciilence of' tuberculosis would have a low incideri~ oi'
bronchogenic carcinoma and vice versa, unless other Sao-

•tors °i are present " they said.

"Our data Indicate that a large increase In bron.
cJtogenic cancer can be expected as the death rate'ft+om,
tuberculosis der.reases. &gt; . .
"At the turn of the century, the United I States
had about 200 dearths per 100w0 from .tuberculosis. If the
same proportion of the population is susceptible to tuber•,
eulosis today, and if 20 percent of this same population
is susceptibie to bronchogenic carcinoma, then 40 per
1!00;0b0 might succumb to lung cancer when tuberculosis
is eradicated. This, of course; is conjecture, but it illus•
trates that a further increase In bronchogenic earcinoma
may, be expected."

Heavy smokers tend to be
less placid than non-smokers:
They are often tense, either
from aggressiveness or ahyness.
They desperately require the

CANCER:


Clue to the Killer?


~ In their constant search for the causes
of lung cancer, researchers have ex-
aminedl virus infections, heavy cigarette
smoking, and air pollution. Last week,
their attention waa-darected to still
another factor-tubenculosis.
Wiiting in the journall of' the American
Medical Associationj Drs. Broda Q:
Barnes of Denver, Colo:, and Max
Ratzenhoferi of' Grax, Austria, reported
that scores of patients were surviving
tuberculosis early in life only to contract
lung Qancer in later years. As collabora-
tors on this paper, the two lung, special-
ists based their conclusions on more tlhan.
20;000 autopsies performed at the Uni-
versity of Graz, indicating that in a largee
number of' cases, the two diseases had
"competed for the same person, tubercu-
losis at aw early age, and cancer as hee
grew older."
These results are confirmed in a see-
ondl report by a Swedish scientist, Dr.
Alf Westergren, who examined 1i00 11ung,
cancer victims and found tuberculosis
scars in the chests of one-third of them.
"Accumulating evidence, both in Eu+•
rope and America, suggests that scars left
by tubercular infection, or other lung
damage, may in later years become the
site of lung cancer," conciudes an article
in The Cancer Bulletin of' the :lmerican
Cancpr Society. "To avoid lung cancer
in oldl age, the cured TB patient must
exercise constant vigilance; he musE
have regUlur lung X rays to detect the-
earliest sigris of' malignancy."'

To Ir"D Decline.


A decline' in deaths due to tuberculosis •has been sug

ftested as a factor in the increasing occurrence of lung,'
cancer.
: Writing in~ the Jou,rnal of the American Medical Aasa
ciation, -Drs. - Broda O. -Bat•nes and Max Ratsenhoffer
said.more persons were surviving TB early In life only too
contract lung cancer In their later years:. ...
-They predicted' t'hat' "a large increase"-In`lung cancer.
could be expected as tuberculosis deaths continue to
decline., :
Their conclusions."were-.based on data from 26;SAI6
, autopsies performed during the past 1'S' years at the: Uni•
versity of Graz, Austria..
:' The study showed that "g 'great reduct'ion in . tuber-
ciilosi's Is occurring lia Graz, as eisewhere."' Lt also showed
that the average age of' patients whd 'died fnom tuber-
culosis was rising.
°In l'9K the average age at death was 39 years;.
while in 1957 it was 54 years," the aut'hors said. "Ini otherr
words; the tubercular patient was approacning tha" `cancer
age' before death." . .
A further indication was that TB.and! lung, cancer are,
not found' frequently in the saone person at the same
tirne. ~

It appears, they said;, "that there are two dieeaaea
corrtpeting .for the same personr tuberculosis at nn early
age and bronchogenic carcinoma as he grows olde :" P; "It' should be expected that' countripa with~a lttgh

, inciilence of' tuberculosis would have a low incideri~ oi'
bronchogenic carcinoma and vice versa, unless other Sao-

•tors °i are present " they said.

"Our data Indicate that a large increase In bron.
cJtogenic cancer can be expected as the death rate'ft+om,
tuberculosis der.reases. &gt; . .
"At the turn of the century, the United I States
had about 200 dearths per 100w0 from .tuberculosis. If the
same proportion of the population is susceptible to tuber•,
eulosis today, and if 20 percent of this same population
is susceptibie to bronchogenic carcinoma, then 40 per
1!00;0b0 might succumb to lung cancer when tuberculosis
is eradicated. This, of course; is conjecture, but it illus•
trates that a further increase In bronchogenic earcinoma
may, be expected."

A speech by Dr. Joseph Berkson of' the INTayo Clinic, received local press
JOLTRNAZ,
;Wi'nston-Salem, North Carolina
December 14, 1960
A leading medical statistician
told the Forsyth Medical Society
•last night that statistics show, a&amp;
great a link bptween~ lung, caneer,
andi an individualfs constitutionat'
makeup'as they do between lung,
cancer and smoking;
Dr. Joseph Berkson, head I of the
Mayo Clinic's division, of' biome-,
try and medical statistics, said
:that', if, lung, cancer is caused' by
smoking, "then so is cancer of''
the stomach, cancer, of, the intes-1
-tlne and cancer of the prostate- I
'all of'which are more common in
smokers than in non-smokers."
Dr. Berksonj speaking, before
about 90 doctors at the Hotel Rob-
ert F:, Lee, said' statistics com-
piled for the American Cancer So-
ciety "turned out to be more than
they bargained for and' more than
'+YVe were prepared to prove."'
Smoking Not Cause
-Dr. Berkson said firmly that be
does not believe smoking, causes
cancer of the lung. "The cause
of cancer is not a statistical prob, lem, but a biological one." He
saidi in every paper he has en-
cwuntered in which a, physician
py,s smoking causes lung can-
fer, "they recite the same old sta-
tistics ... But would you believe
it? NoV one case of pathological
evidence."'
He said statistics should furnish
leads„ but not be considered as
determining the cause of any dis=
ease.
"Clinical evidence, in fact, goes
against smoking as a cause of
lung cancer," Berkson said! He
cited a number of experiments
with animals in which concentrat-
ed tobacco smoke was introduced
into the lungs. "In every case,"'
ihe said, "the results were nega,
tiue." In one experiment, he said,
"not~.a single animal developedl
cancer of the lung, except for one.
control rat (one not exposed to to-
bacco smokel which developed a
lung tumor."'
He said that the theory t}iatt
carcinogens ini tobacco act on
lung, tissue unfavorably "is all
right as a theory, But the statis-
t'ics hrought to bear to support
this theory have shown certain in-
congruities."
jae said population samples
1n the statistics "are not repre-
6entative of the populations from
which they are drawn .:. Al-.
thou;h they show tthat, lung can-
cer is higher among smokers than
among non - smokers, they also
show that' a number of'other dis-
eases are more common among
smokers than non-smokers. . . If
smoking in some say is the cause
of all these diseases, then, gentlie-
men,, we are on the threshhold of
a whole new concept of bioiogical
science," he saidi wryly.
He said there is just as much
statistical evidence to show that
smoking, is a constitutional, even
a heredity, habit. "Identical twins.
have a closer relation in their
smoking habits thanr di-zygotic
(fraternal) twins , - Smokers
are hospitalized more often aqd
participate in, more sports than
non-smokers ...
"On the other hand, non-smok-
ers are slow breeders and' have
more moles on their bodies than
smokers." '
He said statistics also can be
made tb show a. relationship bei
tween the decline ofl certain dis,
eases and the rise of lung, cancer.
He said modern methods which
have slashed the rate of tubercu-
losis may; in fact, contribute to
saving, a child'who formerly would
have died of TB but who will bee
prone to developing lung cancer
in later life.
"What we may' have,"' he said,
""is a survival of unfit respiratory
systems;.'•
Stomach Cancer
I He said' stomach cancer has.
,dropped sharply as lung cancer,
has increased. "Ik is presumptu-
Ious to say that we know the cause
I of lung cancer and donl know the
cause of stomach cancer."
He said that "cigarette smoking
can hardly be recommended, for
its health•restoring - qpalities. Any
physician is on sound ground to
advise against smoking for pa-
tients with certain diseases inn
which it has deleterious effects"
such as coronary diseases and
certain uther circulatory a'rl-
ments: '
"The whole answer may lie in
this."' he saidl "If non-smokers
are able to withstand the high -
pressure advertising of the tobar-.o co industry, they should be ablo
.
to withstand lung cancer or tu,
berculosis."'

Jannary 12, 1961 ..-
MACHINFS now under development in at least three states may
', one day soon bring',about the first great revolution in tobacco grow-
ing since Joha Rolfe planted the first commercial crop at James-
town, Va., nearly 350 years ago.
So writes Stephen E. Wrather, director of the tobacco division
in USDA's Agricultural' Marketing Service, in the current' issue o('
1tbacco News, published by the Tobacco Institute, Inc.
Mr. Wrather doesn't go so far
as tb predict that all~out mechan-
tiation of the nation's 750,000 to-
bacco farms is just' around the
corner. He says, however, that
three tobacco - state universities
report steady progress in the dif-
ficult technicaf problems of' cre-
ating machines to plant, harvest,
house and cure the leaves that
make up one of the nation's most
valuable cash crops.
VERY FEW' changes have
been made in, the basic methods
of planting, harvesting, and
handling tobacco, since the.
Jamestown colony days. It still
takes from 300 to 500 man-
hours of hand labor to "make
the crop,"' far more than for
any other field crop.
CONCENTRATED efforts to
ward mechanization have been
under way for several years at
the Universities of Kentucky and
Connecticut andl at North Caro-
lina State College, Mr. Wrather
states. The State of' Kentucky
plans a million&gt;dollar, statie•fi-
nanced tobacco research center.
Congress appropriated ;250;000
for the project at its last session.
Kentucky experimenters have
succeeded in coating tiny tobacco
seeds with, clay, making them
tnt'n pellets. The increased size
andi uniform shape make ma-
chine-planting possible, and iplant,
ing is done through holes spaced
18 • inches apart in a strip of
black polyethylene Flastic which
in turn forms a mulch strip to
inhibit the growth of l weeds, con,
serve moisture, and warm, the
soil around the seed-pellet.
Encouraging results from this
method hold hopes of elimnating,
the traditional, long, and laborious
process of sterili¢ing' a small plot'
of soil, planting and sprouting the
sethds, then transplanting the
seedlings from bed to field.
xenwci,y aiso nas Deen experi-
menting with two mechanical har-•
vesters.
At the University of' Connecti-
cut, development o: a mechanical
leaf-picking machine has been a
inajor project. The Connecticut
machine cuts the tobacco stallc,
strips the leaves form it, collects
the leaves and ejects the stripped
stalk: The cigar-binder type of
ieaf' grownin Connecticut has
traditionally been stalk-cured, so
success of the harvester may
lean heavily on development of
new curing methods.
And;, of course, experiment into
both mechanical' harvesting and
bulk curing have been under way
at North Carolina State College
where the belief' is that' tradition-
al curing methods, in whichi each
leaf' must be strung on a stick
and later removed, is one prime
obstacle to mechanication. Bulk
curing would enable the sirnul-
taneous curing of' thousands of
leaves pressed into a compact
mass..
MECHANICATION, writes
Mr. Wrather, is urgently need-
ed as a cost-reduction measure
for tobacco growing. Field la-
bor is not only going up ~ in
price, but tobacco growers are
finding hand labor, increasingly
hard to locate due to increas-
ing industrialization in many
tbbacco-growing, areas.

`T o bacco and A mcricans
By Chester Davis
Robert K. Heimann opens his handsome book
"Tobacco and Americans" (McGraw-Hill, N. Y.,
265 pages, $7.50) on this note:
"Tobacco originated in America; it was this
nation's first business; Americans brought it to
its present stage of development. The story of
tobacco is somewhat more than a business history.
It is, in many ways, the story of America itself."
And he closes his book_ with these words:
,.the story of Americans and tobacco is
more than industriall chronicle. It is a lesson in
social science, in economics, in history; it is, in
its own way, a testament of freedom."
Between the raising and the dropping of the
curtain Heimann documents his case in a book
which, besides telling a fascinating story- in cap-
tivating fashion, is so lavishly illustrated and so
beautifully laid out that the reader is entitled to
suspect that the venture was rather substantially
subsidized by the tobacco industry.
Long Tug of War
Besides providing a splendid bonus for the book
- buyer such a subsidy is by no means improper.
If the tobacco industry fails to speak out on its
own behalf it can be certain only that its de-
tractors will not be so self-effacing.
As Heimann points out, tobacco traditionally has
been pulled and yanked between this nation's puri-
tanical conscience and the delight individuals find
- -
in "the bewitching vegetable."This tug of war is
nicely summed up in the doggerel rhyme which
contains the line:
"Tobacco is a filthy weed. I love it!"
In a more scholarly fashion Heimann explains
this schizophrenia over tobacco in terms of dis-
trust of the heathen. He writes, ". ..among Euro-
peans the appetite for tobacco was at t variance
with their intellectual distrust of any native cus-
tom, including smoking. This puritanical contra-
diction was to reappear many times in the later
history of Europeans, Americans and tobacco.''
When the Europeans first explored the fringes
of the Americas they found that the natives uni-
versally used (sometimes by smoking but also in
covered, also, that there were two forms of to-
bacco; the small leafed, bitter and wickedly
strong Nicotiana (so named for Jean Nicot, a
French explorer) rustica and the broad leafed,
mild Nicotiana tabacum of the Caribbean, South
and Central America regions.
This last species is the basis of the tobacco
industry and it was introduced in North America
in 1612 at Jamestown by a planter named John
Rolfe. (Rolfe's other singular distinction is that
he married Pocahontas.) This Jamestown leaf-
often called Oronoko-provided the economic foun-
dation on which the Virginia and Maryland col-
-
onies built.
North Carolina was not so fortunate. Because
this state lacked deep water ports-and because
Virginia forbade the importation of North Caro-
lina leaf by land or water-this state's tobacco
economy was slow in developing and tobacco did
not become a truly major factor in North Carolina
until after the Civil War.
Tar Ifeel Soil
And that occutred largely for reasons over
which the Virginians had no control. As Heimann
notes:
"One of the modt striking characteristics of Nic-
otiana tabacum is that It is more true to the
earth in which it grows than to the seed from
which it springs. Seed tobacco from North Caro-
lina, now the center of Bright tobacco, has been
-
transplanted into Cuba in an effort to grow Amer-
ican cigarette grades on that island; in two sea-
sons, the Carolina seed generates Cuban cigar
leaf."
Tobacco became important in Piedmont North
Carolirra when it was discovered (1) that the thin,
silica laced soils of this area produced a lighter,
yellower leaf than did the rich lands of Tidewater
and (2) when, in the 1850's, the process of flue
(or heat) curing was perfected by the Slade fam-
ily of Caswell County.
In the social sense tobacco h3s had a profound
impact on_ our national character. The broad leaf
provided the support from the which this nation's
one valid aristocracy (that of Tidewater Virginia)
developed. In th-. economic sense tobacco provid-.
ed a means of livelihood-and a road to wealth-
the form of snuff or quid) tobacco. They dis- ~ in places as scattered as Boston (cigars from

Using the hard sell (particularly In back-road

quality product, saccharine (which enabled bright
to rival burley in sweetness) and shirtsleeve hard
work, Winston became the manufacturing capital

The occasional reports of the Ta -"

Onr of' the ]bte reports chowed` _
the inabiLity of laboratory workers
to induce lung cancer in mice,
on such a pervasive basis as to in-•
dicate a connection between the'
two. There is also another large
.variety of' findings showing thatt
air' pollution and the presence ofi
the various viruses may ^play roies:
in producing the lung disease. One
recent study showed a correl'atlon _
bettveen cardiovascular disease
and mental or emotional stress.'
This corroborates other studiesr
that tend to prove that the basis,, "'
huldamentally, of' many oliseasea,
is that of stress.
As' most of' us are increasingly' +
aware; the statisticians have pro- "
duced a- strong case against' tbe :'
cigarette. It would be stronger ex-
cept for the fact that medicali bis- '
tory has been full of wild alxrums!
and''i excursions. There is hardly :'
a human habit, includiny, that of'
coffep drinkiug„ that has not att
one time or another drawn medi-,
cal wrath as being injurious to
the person. There have also been
other fads, including the removal,
of teeth, durin;; one period, appen-'
-dixes at' another. Earlier than that,
holes were often bored in the head
to let the epileptic spirits emerge.
To be sure medicine has' moved
onto a higher, brighter plateau by
now. But it Is not so far removed,
yet from, the days of classical err•
or that one can jump without
,questioning into the camp of tuse,
:anti-cigarette torces. There seems ;
to be little doubt that Individual
idiosyncrasies' are important: And
surely excess here, as in any otb-

tute points out, these could well'' :
be faulty because there are many ...
other factors, inherent and exter- :
nall t:hat may play leading' roles `
in each iadividuali casc. ; . 'ti.,?;;
Onr of' the ]bte reports chowed` _
the inabiLity of laboratory workers
to induce lung cancer in mice,
on such a pervasive basis as to in-•
dicate a connection between the'
two. There is also another large
.variety of' findings showing thatt
air' pollution and the presence ofi
the various viruses may ^play roies:
in producing the lung disease. One
recent study showed a correl'atlon _
bettveen cardiovascular disease
and mental or emotional stress.'
This corroborates other studiesr
that tend to prove that the basis,, "'
huldamentally, of' many oliseasea,
is that of stress.
As' most of' us are increasingly' +
aware; the statisticians have pro- "
duced a- strong case against' tbe :'
cigarette. It would be stronger ex-
cept for the fact that medicali bis- '
tory has been full of wild alxrums!
and''i excursions. There is hardly :'
a human habit, includiny, that of'
coffep drinkiug„ that has not att
one time or another drawn medi-,
cal wrath as being injurious to
the person. There have also been
other fads, including the removal,
of teeth, durin;; one period, appen-'
-dixes at' another. Earlier than that,
holes were often bored in the head
to let the epileptic spirits emerge.
To be sure medicine has' moved
onto a higher, brighter plateau by
now. But it Is not so far removed,
yet from, the days of classical err•
or that one can jump without
,questioning into the camp of tuse,
:anti-cigarette torces. There seems ;
to be little doubt that Individual
idiosyncrasies' are important: And
surely excess here, as in any otb-
er way, is bad. But the Tobacco
Institute, self . interestled as It is,
seems to have little trouble gath- ,
ering medical counsel to ~ sny the'
ease has not been proven against
cigarettes.-Hartford Courant

' THE NEWS' AND OBSERVER
..Raleigh, North Carolina
Jannary 12, 1961 ..-
MACHINFS now under development in at least three states may
', one day soon bring',about the first great revolution in tobacco grow-
ing since Joha Rolfe planted the first commercial crop at James-
town, Va., nearly 350 years ago.
So writes Stephen E. Wrather, director of the tobacco division
in USDA's Agricultural' Marketing Service, in the current' issue o('
1tbacco News, published by the Tobacco Institute, Inc.
Mr. Wrather doesn't go so far
as tb predict that all~out mechan-
tiation of the nation's 750,000 to-
bacco farms is just' around the
corner. He says, however, that
three tobacco - state universities
report steady progress in the dif-
ficult technicaf problems of' cre-
ating machines to plant, harvest,
house and cure the leaves that
make up one of the nation's most
valuable cash crops.
VERY FEW' changes have
been made in, the basic methods
of planting, harvesting, and
handling tobacco, since the.
Jamestown colony days. It still
takes from 300 to 500 man-
hours of hand labor to "make
the crop,"' far more than for
any other field crop.
CONCENTRATED efforts to
ward mechanization have been
under way for several years at
the Universities of Kentucky and
Connecticut andl at North Caro-
lina State College, Mr. Wrather
states. The State of' Kentucky
plans a million&gt;dollar, statie•fi-
nanced tobacco research center.
Congress appropriated ;250;000
for the project at its last session.
Kentucky experimenters have
succeeded in coating tiny tobacco
seeds with, clay, making them
tnt'n pellets. The increased size
andi uniform shape make ma-
chine-planting possible, and iplant,
ing is done through holes spaced
18 • inches apart in a strip of
black polyethylene Flastic which
in turn forms a mulch strip to
inhibit the growth of l weeds, con,
serve moisture, and warm, the
soil around the seed-pellet.
Encouraging results from this
method hold hopes of elimnating,
the traditional, long, and laborious
process of sterili¢ing' a small plot'
of soil, planting and sprouting the
sethds, then transplanting the
seedlings from bed to field.
xenwci,y aiso nas Deen experi-
menting with two mechanical har-•
vesters.
At the University of' Connecti-
cut, development o: a mechanical
leaf-picking machine has been a
inajor project. The Connecticut
machine cuts the tobacco stallc,
strips the leaves form it, collects
the leaves and ejects the stripped
stalk: The cigar-binder type of
ieaf' grownin Connecticut has
traditionally been stalk-cured, so
success of the harvester may
lean heavily on development of
new curing methods.
And;, of course, experiment into
both mechanical' harvesting and
bulk curing have been under way
at North Carolina State College
where the belief' is that' tradition-
al curing methods, in whichi each
leaf' must be strung on a stick
and later removed, is one prime
obstacle to mechanication. Bulk
curing would enable the sirnul-
taneous curing of' thousands of
leaves pressed into a compact
mass..
MECHANICATION, writes
Mr. Wrather, is urgently need-
ed as a cost-reduction measure
for tobacco growing. Field la-
bor is not only going up ~ in
price, but tobacco growers are
finding hand labor, increasingly
hard to locate due to increas-
ing industrialization in many
tbbacco-growing, areas.

Next year., then, will be the

of 'that' anniversary:.
No, other industry in modern
America can claim such an, earlyy

now-a period covering three and

A year or so ago, some kind
of celebration was held in Eog-,

of American tobacco, to that
country. But the English celebra-
tion, it seems to me, was a little
premathre, for the tobacco indus-
tt•y did not have its commercial

Anyway, even if the English al.

Durham's Bndl-ock

Tobacco, as an industry and an economic factor, is
,strong. Progress in the industry continues. So says Dur-
ham.'s own George V. Adlen„president of'the Tobacco In.
stitute, Inc.
Tobacco manufacturing, reached new highs this year,
nset', new records-particularly in output, acceptance and
' use by a growing consumer population, and' greater con-
tribution to the social' and economic well-being of the na-
s tion's agriculture, business and governments." ' :
The export prospect, too,, is good. "From years of
personal, experience abroad;"' said Mr. Alden„ "I know
that American tobacco prodlnets are among our goodwill
amtiassadorsi of longest standing. This is especially sig-
nificant now, in view of the continued' outflow of gold and'
the import-export imbalance. In the campaign to ship
American products instead of gold abroad, the tobacco
indinstry is in the front'ranks,';
AlI of those things are good news to Durham; for to-
bacco is Durham's economic bedrock. Durham, too;, knows
by experience that tobacco, in good times and bad,, is a
strong economic bulwark. •
Durham, indeed, was spawned in tobacco andl grew
to stability through tobacco, While diversification has
been enjoyed and promises to strengthen further the Dur-
ham fabric, Durham is ever aware of' tobacco, from the
farm to the consumer, and finds satisfaction and a sense
of security in the good fortune which attends the great
Industry.

Scientist Says CancerT'

PASADENA, Calif., Jan. 5

ogy says.
If truer, research may show'
It can be 'relieved with drugs's

inines, he says.
I
This concept was outlined!
yesterday by Dr. Albert Tyler.
fia the Journal of the Iilational
Cancer Institute.
Dr. Tyler, professor of embry-
ology, admits his theory is
controversial„ but, calls it
"tnore reasonable than existing
t+heories."
. h!ke most investigators, Dr.
Tyler believes cancer starts with
a change in one or more cells
which causes them to grow ab-
r:ormaIDy. The change can be
caused by radittion, chemicals,
or a virus or bacteria. Only one
bell need be altered to, start a
tumor.
Dr. Tyler's theory differs in
the kindi of change that occurs.
Each cell contains thousands
of genes, and each of these
determines some characteristic
of the cell. Under Dr. Tyler's
concept, the genes lost are those
that control a cell's ability to
'get along with fellow cells.
These are called compatability
genes.
The cell with the missing
genes recognizes it is different
from other cells, becomes aller-
gic to them and tries to destroy'
them. It also multiplies exces-
sively so it will have compan-
ions in its figh't.
This, Dr. Tyler believes; mayy
be the way a tumor grows.

Among possible treatments
he suggesta ~ . . _ ..
1. Loss of the genes might be
overcome by supplying certain
elements (nucleic acid) to the
cell to enable It to reconstruct
the missing gene. WiW all
genes intact, the cell would no
onger feel like an outlaw. '&gt; t

COI.LEGE' PARK, Md., Dees i veys made since 1909 have
125 .(AP)-A University of'~yielded similar results:,
on his'i
Maryl'and' psychologist reports' Ifindings Pumroy this'way: commented "There are
that cigarette•smoking stu+i many rules that are laid down
dentb do not do as well aca+~by the adult society and with
demically on the average as'~,which adults tay they and
nonsmokers. ,
A survey conducted by Don-,
ald K. Pumroy, assistant pro•
fessor of psychology, indicat-
ed. that the more a student
smokes the lower his grades
are likely to be. Pumroy said
the report did riot Itnpiy,thatl
smokdng, dulls the mind or en-i
thusiasm for study. HP theo-~
rized that the reasons students
smoke may be related to the
reasons they avoid studyit,g.
In Pumroy's sample of 204
freshman boys„ who were se•
lected for the test at ramdom,
119 nonsmokers had am averl,
age grade of 1.98. Under the
University of Maryland grad•
;ing systemi a grade of 2.00 is

i ~ p~353 ~.3~~ - .
others should conform. Cer-
tainly one rule has to do lwith
smoking.
"The rule is that children
should not' smoke until they
reach a particular age. TA'is-
is the law in many states.
Thus if a child, wants to ap•pear grown up or to rebel.
against the adult culture, then
the way to d'o' it Is to smoke.
"Society alsc says that you
shpuld study. To bc negative
to 'society, smoke and' don't

Scientist Says CancerT'
May Be an Allergy
PASADENA, Calif., Jan. 5
iAP).-Cancer may be a form~
bf allergy, a scientist at the
.California Institute of Technol-,
ogy says.
If truer, research may show'
It can be 'relieved with drugs's
such as cortisone or anahista-
inines, he says.
I
This concept was outlined!
yesterday by Dr. Albert Tyler.
fia the Journal of the Iilational
Cancer Institute.
Dr. Tyler, professor of embry-
ology, admits his theory is
controversial„ but, calls it
"tnore reasonable than existing
t+heories."
. h!ke most investigators, Dr.
Tyler believes cancer starts with
a change in one or more cells
which causes them to grow ab-
r:ormaIDy. The change can be
caused by radittion, chemicals,
or a virus or bacteria. Only one
bell need be altered to, start a
tumor.
Dr. Tyler's theory differs in
the kindi of change that occurs.
Each cell contains thousands
of genes, and each of these
determines some characteristic
of the cell. Under Dr. Tyler's
concept, the genes lost are those
that control a cell's ability to
'get along with fellow cells.
These are called compatability
genes.
The cell with the missing
genes recognizes it is different
from other cells, becomes aller-
gic to them and tries to destroy'
them. It also multiplies exces-
sively so it will have compan-
ions in its figh't.
This, Dr. Tyler believes; mayy
be the way a tumor grows.

Among possible treatments
he suggesta ~ . . _ ..
1. Loss of the genes might be
overcome by supplying certain
elements (nucleic acid) to the
cell to enable It to reconstruct
the missing gene. WiW all
genes intact, the cell would no
onger feel like an outlaw. '&gt; t
2. It might be possible to de-
troy cancer cells by injecting
zconcentrations of substances
rom normal cells -.!hieh would.
:.z
pvercome the destructiveness of'
the outlaw cellc_ '
'
3. At least' temporary relief
might be obtained by using ra- ,
diations cortisone or antihistar '
mines to suppress the outlaw'
celi's ability to form substances' ',
which destroy normal cells.

as "conservative" and "cau+

required to draft it, he said.
The statement suggested that
the risk of heart' attacks andl
strokes might be reduced for
s o m e individuals by cutting,
down on consumption, of' meat,
butter andl other prodtact's con-,

sentful" attitude about heart as-
sociation st'atements. The AH,AA
issued a statement last June
about the statistical association'
between heavy pigaret smoking j
and heart attacks.
"There is very clear evi-
idence," Dr. Paul said, "that
among those who smoke one
package a day or more, there is
more coronary (heart) disease."
,
He said this did not nr.,cessar-I
ily mean that cigaret smoking
was a directt cause of heart at-

higher early death rate from al~
most alll diseases among heavy
cigaret smokers, he said.
2,000Under Study
Dr. Paul is an associate pro-]

So far, the study, which has
ontinued for three years, shows
that men w i th heart disease
have a tendency to have higher
blood pressure, higher blood
cholesterol, a greater long, term
use of cigarets and more "driive"'

raised!$26,600,p00 this year for

t
ich fhe American Cancer Society is fanning what
seems to some fanatical flames against smoking, espe- ._
cially itlthose pe•,)ple have been contributin!g,any of'their
money to the A'n:,erican Cancer Society. Presumably, no
longer' Is the Cancer Society content' to center its fire
on cigarettes. It has announced plans to "woo teenagers
'
away from smoking."
.
It Is attempting to saturate schools with a, sound-color
filinstrip, "To Smoke or not to Smoke,"' and a good many
school officials are cooperating. "More than 10,000 copies
of'the filmstrip, together with related materials have been
distributed during the last eight months," says the Can-
~- cer Society's public education d'irector. The theme for the
teenager is that they'll! most likely get liang cancer if
they smoke cigarettes.
'"A'ctually;" says the New York Daily News,, taking
~.? cognizance of the campaign, "there is no laboratory proof
t'hat' cigarettes cause lung cancer. Actually, too, the
~ great majority of heavy cigarette' smokers do not' con-
tract the disease."
The News suggests that the American Cancer Society
might 'stop spending so much of' its contributors' money
on propaganda," abandon its "teen-age terror, campai.gn,"'
and give its money to "bona fide research projects."
There does seem to be some question as to whether *
m : t'he' American Cancer Society has not gone off' on a tan-
gent. It may be that the ACS' regards to all-out attack
on smoking as a sensational "gimmick" designedi to gain
the public eye and step up contributions.
The Fatalistic Anterican
-The ugdy American. good fellow that lie Is, is noth.
ing compared to the fatalistic American. Or so It
would seem from a recent statement' on cigarette
salbs, IDespitle all f7ie horrendous medical reports con-
cerning the evils of smoking„ sales for 1960 reached
a new peak. The per capita consnmptionof'those over
15 last year. reached a new lugh of four packs a
week. Ainericans spent the astronomical lotal of $7.5'
billion on tobacco, of which $6.6 biliion, went for the
purchase of 475 billion cigarettes.
: All this in the face of a steady stream of reports
from the medical societies alleging t'he statistical eor-
relation between cigarettes, lung cancer, and cororiary
disease. one can attribute this situation to~ one of
several reasons: 1's The fact that no clinical evidence
has yet been prodticed supporting t(ae medical
elaims, 2. The fact that many people have' a childish
disinclination to face the horrid truth. 3. The clever-
nPas and psychological appeal of cigarelte advertis-
ing. 4: The fact that people don't believe what they
read, particudirly when a winsome fellow tells them
how good cigarettes tasle. 6. The fact lihat the history
of the medical profession is full of' alarums and eacua
sions, its pages strewn with teeth, appendices, and
other previous sacrifices to medical theory: The cur-
re
mat kick on cholestrol is a companion piece: Final.
•1jV; there is the fact that most people are fatalistic
aod believe whatever will be;' willl be.
There are probably other motivations, but there
ls'no doubt' whatevcr that in the current contest forr
the American' mind between the siveet singers of slo-
gans and the men in white, the latter are coming,out
a poor second. This, however, is fully consistent with
the previous record of'the medical profession in beinl;
unable to carry a mesa.ge. So we have the current'
paradox; The doctbrs %icw with alarm; the' people
go right on smoking.

P~~..
The occasional reports of the Ta -"
bacco Institute on research,work, :.
part'icularly with rqferenee to cor t}A
.onary disorders and lung'cancers,
.argue that there Is still no cl.ear•.
.cut' case: againsteigarettes, And! In fact there Is no open -and- _:
shut case _ proved on a clintcal;
basis. There is, of course, a atrong:, .
atat'isticali case. But. as the Instt -;;
tute points out, these could well'' :
be faulty because there are many ...
other factors, inherent and exter- :
nall t:hat may play leading' roles `
in each iadividuali casc. ; . 'ti.,?;;
Onr of' the ]bte reports chowed` _
the inabiLity of laboratory workers
to induce lung cancer in mice,
on such a pervasive basis as to in-•
dicate a connection between the'
two. There is also another large
.variety of' findings showing thatt
air' pollution and the presence ofi
the various viruses may ^play roies:
in producing the lung disease. One
recent study showed a correl'atlon _
bettveen cardiovascular disease
and mental or emotional stress.'
This corroborates other studiesr
that tend to prove that the basis,, "'
huldamentally, of' many oliseasea,
is that of stress.
As' most of' us are increasingly' +
aware; the statisticians have pro- "
duced a- strong case against' tbe :'
cigarette. It would be stronger ex-
cept for the fact that medicali bis- '
tory has been full of wild alxrums!
and''i excursions. There is hardly :'
a human habit, includiny, that of'
coffep drinkiug„ that has not att
one time or another drawn medi-,
cal wrath as being injurious to
the person. There have also been
other fads, including the removal,
of teeth, durin;; one period, appen-'
-dixes at' another. Earlier than that,
holes were often bored in the head
to let the epileptic spirits emerge.
To be sure medicine has' moved
onto a higher, brighter plateau by
now. But it Is not so far removed,
yet from, the days of classical err•
or that one can jump without
,questioning into the camp of tuse,
:anti-cigarette torces. There seems ;
to be little doubt that Individual
idiosyncrasies' are important: And
surely excess here, as in any otb-
er way, is bad. But the Tobacco
Institute, self . interestled as It is,
seems to have little trouble gath- ,
ering medical counsel to ~ sny the'

MEDICAL. NEWS _ Niew York, New York
:.November 9, 1960
NEW. ORLEANS - A n appeal
has been filed here to set aside
the verdict of a Federal district
court 'which refused to hold two
tobacco companies liable for.the
death of Frank J. Lartigue from
;iuiag cancer.
. Despite some of' the st!rongest'
ststements to date by medical
researchers on the connection
&amp;tween heavy smokin!g, and
bronchogenic carcinoma, the
court' ruled against Mr. Lar-
tigue's widow, who was suing the
Ligpett and Myers and R. J.
Reynolds tobacco companies for.
$150,000 daRnages: r LPndoubtedty
a'`factor in the court's decision
-was the tobacco companies' abil-
ity "to give as good as tlrey got"
n medical testimony,
The judge Instructed the ;.•rry-
en that' a verdict for the plain.
4ii could be returtied only if
they found that the cornpanies''s
haEd known that' cigarettes were
dangerous before Mt. Lartigue
tlevelopedithe squamous-cell car-
cinoma firom, which he died in
1'955'. The propriety of this in-
struetion will be` challenged in
the •appeal;' according to plain-
tifS's counsel.
Mr. Lart'igue„ described as a



in 1st Round in Court ~Bot' t .
"cigarette flend" and a "human
chirnney " was said to have
smoked' two to five packs a day
from the age of 9 until his death
at 65.
Dr: Altoni Ochsner Sr. of ATew.
Orleans led the expert witnesses
for the plaintiff. "I have yet to
see," he said, "the physician who
witl not admit the causal' rela-
tlionship between. srmoking and
cancer except for two, groups:
people in the employ of the to-
bacco companies and people who
are addicted. Obviously If I am
addicted, I am likely to try to
excuse it'."'
.Convinced of Relationship
The Tulane surgeon testified
that examination of'slides made
for the autopsy had convinced
him that Lartigue had died
of, squamous - ceil . carcinoma
brought on by excessive smok-
ing, adding, that a person who
smokes enough Is certain to de-
velop cancer.
'"There is a good deal of, varl-
lat~ion [among individualkp," he
continued, "but generally a pack
a day for 20 to 25 years is about
the length of time for the can-
cer-producing agent to produce
cancer."
Witnesses for the defense
maintained that no relation be-
tween smoking and lung cancerr
has been scientifically proved.
In this group were Dr. Harry S.
N. Greene, professor of pathol~
ogy at Yale University School of
Medicizde, Dr. Charles W. Mayo
of the Mayo Clinic, and Dr.
Clarence C. Little, scientif~c di-
rector of the Tobacco Industry
Research Committee.
Among highlights of testimony
presented for the plaintiff:
• "Carcinogenic mater[aU' Is
obtained&amp; from all forms of to-
bacco smoke: .., Tumors or sores
have appeared on the backs of
mice painted with carcinogenic
compounds.-Dr: B. L. Van Duu-
ren, assistant professor of in-

Lartigue not smoked "he would '
not have had the cancer from
which he dled."-Dr. Richard H.

~doubt that long, heavy smoking
will result in cancer of the
lung."-Dr. George E. Moore, dI=

at Roswell Park.
• Of 132 patients wSth 'lung,
cancer, 130 were smokers.-Dr:.
~Suk Chul' Chang, pathology de-
partment, University of, Toronto.
For the defense,, Dr. MayoI as-"
sertedi that' although in, some
cases of' lung, cancer smokdng
may be a contributing factor,
!n, his opinion it has not been
established as the sole cause.
'
Dr. Greene said he could not
state with medical certaintyy
that smoking Is "t'heP cause, "a"
cause, a "probable" cause, or a
"contributing" cause in ' lung
cancer. There is no proof„ he
said, that the disease is in-
creasing. t
Cause 'Unknown'
Dr: Little said his committee
had spent' $4 million on research
ihithe past six years and he still
believes the cause of lung can-
cer Is unknown.
Insisting that he had never
been subjected to pressure from
the tobacco companies, Dr. Little
said: "We have had more free-
dom than any other project with
wh[ieh I have ever been assocf-
ated."
Highlights of other testimony
for the dlefense: , .
• Of more than 2,000 cancer
patients, 20-25% were . non~
smokers. "I have seen only four
cases of cancer of the trachea,
which gets the blast' ofl the cigr
arette smoke coming andi going."
-Dr. Thomas H: Burford, 'Dro- .
fessor of surgery, Washington
University, St. Louis.
• "We don't know the cause
of cancer. Whether there is a.
possiblliity that tobacco causes
cancer is not scientifically
proved."-Dr. Howard R. Mahor-
ner, professor of surgery, Lauial-

` POST GAZETTE &amp; SUN TEL,EMAPH
`` `Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania I
:;; January 25 y 1961 _
, By DR. GEORGE W. CRA1~T®7
Itassell D., aged' 33, is a brilliant physician.
'~ "Dr. Crane,"' he began as we d'inedd together, "I
Wiah you would! write about a common error of' pa-
tients.
"For example, I am now treating a patient
: 'leukemia. We decided to give
him a couple of blood trans+
. fusions recently,, so we askedd
his wife it'she ;
. :couldi procure
some donors.
"And s h e '
did so. These '
donors were
hard working ;
married men
who were:
good friends
of the family
and gladly do-
nated their
blood..
•Dr. Crane
Bitt, my patient, is a smoliper,
so he soon ruined the efMet
of the generous blood donqrs
by 'fixing', the hemoglobirf}in,
the new blood via carbon,
monozide, inhaled from hiss
cigarets."'
What Dr. Russell has in
mind is the simple medical
fact tlhat' Inhaled carbon
monoxide "kills" redblood
corpuscles.
To make it' more graphic,
suppose you had leukemia
,and needed a, pir,t of fresh
blood to tide you along.
Wouldn't it be stupid of you
to slit your own wrist' and fef
one pint of your ownn blood
leak out when you were beg-
ging friends to contribute one
pint of blood to raise ymur
•blood supply?
Well, that Is precisely thee
type of' thing a smoker' does
when he "fixes"' the hemo.
globin in his redl cells, for
toey are no good to him
thereafter.
with
They still float around in
his blood vessels, but are
deadheads, doing no work
and just an added' strain on
the heart.
. . .
~ Patent medicine cleverly
uses the slogan about' "Tired'
B1ood;" but you make your
blood "tired"' with every
cigaret, and we medics arenit
joking.
Our American Medical As-
sociation recently told the
public that "The relative
oxygen deficiency from smok•
ing three cigarets is equal to
that of, traveling, at a 7,500
foot altitude," so it warned
all auto driwers to beware of
driving if they smoke just
prior to or during the tim e
they are at the wheel of their
car:
If' you ever tried' to climb a
mountain, such as Pike's
Peak, you may recalP the fast
pulse and, breathlessness due
to the oxygen deficiency in
the air. -
Well, that' same sort of defi-
ciency . occurs even at sea
level after a matter of' a, few
cigarets.
A'nd' the tragedy of, leu-
kemia, heart eases, pneu•
moniar, asthmatiesand others
who needi pleny of, rich blood
vs; the "tired" variety, is the
fact t'obacco, carbon monoxide
FE:RN4AND;NTLY des t r o y a
their, red blood cells..
. . .
Remember the old adage
about "biting the hand, that
feeds you"?
Well, if' you ask for a
blood transfusion from a
friend and then kili its effec-
tiveness in, a short time via
cigarets;, you are literally
mocking the generosity , of,
your pal' who donated that
blood..
He -mildly jeopardized his
own health by offering that
blood, sW you should treat It
with, dignity and great re-
spect.
A pint of' bloodl Is about
10 per cent of a personls full
supply: So the donor thus
lays down 10 per cent of his
life when he gives you a
blood donation of' one pint:
Be sure you sick folks
recognize that fact and thus
play ba11'1 with,Uhose generous
folks who offer -you their
very life blood. .
(Editor's Note: It is known that blood specialists have questioned Dr. Crane
because existing medical literature does not seem to support the views
;
about his comments on the "permanent" effect of carbon monoxide on blood.,
expressed in this column.).

George V.
tlve, who on Dec. 1 stepped
down as director of the United
States Information Agency follow-
ing long service as a career dip-
lomat to become president of the
` .Tobacco Institute, Inc., said to-
day:tliat upon assuming his new
,; iob he was "impressed with the
record achievements of the to-
bacco industry during the past
year and also with the promises
of'continued progress in 1961 and
future years."
"The tobacco economy in 1960
continued' to set new records-
particularly in output, acceptance
and use by a growing consumer
population, and greater contribu-
tion to the social and economic
well-being of the nation's agricul-
ture, business and governments,"
he said. ,
"There is every indication that
comparable progress will con-i
tinue in the next and succeeding'
I
years.
"The accomplishments of' the
Industry stand out in any 196o're-1
view, despite the fact that tobac-~
co this year, as in other reeent.
years, has continued to be sub-,
jected to attacks ranging from
health scares to unfair taxation
and labeling, proposals.
"To lend understanding to this
aeemingly paradoxical situation is
one of' the aims of the Tobacco~
' Institute to which I hope to give
Irr.petus.
"In its first three years„ under
excellent leadership and'planning,
the institute has laid the founda-
tion and' built' up a broad pro-
gr2m to inform the American
public of the real and broad sig-
nificance of' the tobacco industry
in, the nation, and indeed, thee
world. Along with' the Tobacco
Industry Research Committee,
which has been sponsoring inde-
pendent health research since.
1954, the institute has been help-,
ing to give ~he public an intelli-

actually views the relationship be-
tween tobacco and health,
"Facts are finally replacing,

total tax on cigarettes 6' centsl
In these two subdiivisions.
Stnokers there would continuee
paying the same aihount: • '
In_ other subdivSsions, there
would be t'ax increases ranging
from 1 or 2 cents in the few
counties which have their own
local levies to 3 cents in thosee
counties which now have no
local tax. The great majority
of counties do not levy the
tax. Montgomery County
levies a 2-cent tax and! would
stand to gain $250,020 a year
through the State cigarette
tax increase. Prince Georges
at .prescent imposes no local
levy on cigarettes and would
gain about $1 million a year.
The bill provides for return-
ing the new revenue, estimated
at about $5' million; to subdi!-
visions on the basis of' what
they now tax and! in proportion
'to their populations,
A detailed breakdown on the
proposed redistributdon is not
available.
Another Tax Separate.
Separate from the cigarette
tax bill'is anadministration tax
for financing $10 million in new
State aidlto subdivisions for ed-
ucation and welfare programs.
The Governor has not said
ahat' form this tax will take,
but best guesses are he will go
along with fiscal advisers and
lower the sales t'ax starting
pmint' from purchases over 51
,cent's to those costing over 20
cents. The tax also would be
reapplied to restaurant meals,
pi incipa4ly those costing over
$1.25.
The chief alternative to this
is changing the exemption now
allowed for State income taxes
or applying a surtax to larger
incomes. The Governor's ad-
visers are said to feel this
might receive a chillier recep-
tion than adjusting the sales
tax.
The question on both levies
Is how the General Assembly
will go for enacting two taxes,
neither of which is absolutely
mandatory in, a year of' aurplus.

POUGHKEEPSIE - State Sena+
tor Ernest I. Hatfield, representa-

at Albany designed to abolish taxes,
on smoking, literally. '
Mr. Hatfield's proposed mea

tax imposedl two years ago on
cigars and tobacco, and a oner
centra-pack tax on cigarets, im- _
posed after World War 11 to fI
nance the soldier bonus paysnents:
The senator noted that the cig=
aret tax, after fulfilling the needs'
the bonus; was diverted to i pub-.
lie health including mental hygiene,'
and that a"more than ample;
surplus" is now available. . t,_
. It Is said that the cigar-tobacco
tax will amount toi about $10 mil-
lion this year with the cigaret tJax
designed to ibring in about $;103,000,-~

The senator saidl he ~ad found'•
"considerable sentimen In last,

FOR FREi,EASE' DECEMBER 28, 1961, OFt' IN YEAR'-END~ EDITIONS
TOBACCO INDUSTRY EXPECTS TO BREA'fC' FtECORDS
Washington -- The nation's tobacco economy should set new records

,;..
again in 1962, the industry's 350th anniversary year, topping the records
;f;
set in 1961, reports George V. Allen, president of The Tobacco~Institute, Inc.
In a year-end review and outlook, Mr. Allen said:

"There appears to be little question that in the next 12 months we

shall see new records, topping those set in 1961', for income to tobacco

growers, for output of'most manufactured products, and for contribut3;ons
to other segments of the national econoay, including excise and other tax
payments to all levels of government."'
Mr. Allen cited'these 1961 record.s;
. Two billiompounds of tobacco were grown by tobacco farmers, who
--received about $1.3 billion for their crops during the year. Higher quality .

Use of'cigars, cigarillos and'smoki'ng tobacco also showed gains.
- more -
leaf'brought better prices than ever to the farmers.
. About 44 percent of what'consumers paid'for cigarettes was for
federal, state and local taxes. On cigarettes alone, taxes were $3.1
billion, up from $2.9 billion in 1960,
in 196]., up~ $400 million.

Two Tax Bites Soon
ANhLAPOLISi Jan. 9 (AP).,-
Prospects now appear strongl
that Maryland taxpayers willl
feel two tax bites, insteadi of'
,iust one, from the General As-
sembly's 90-day session whichi
opened last wepk.
Smokers outside Baltimore!
City and, Baltimore County face
increases up to 3 cents a pack
in the price they now pay for
cigarettes. The amount will
double in most counties from
the present 3 cents per pack
now leviedi by the State.
In addition, residents will
probably be paying about $10
million more a year in sales
taxes, chiefly on purchases un-
der 51 cents which are now
exempt.
Revenue from both levies will
be for the benefit of local gov-
ernments.
Legisl3ture Iteturns.
The probable tax program
began taking more 'definite
shape today as the 1951 Legis-
lature returned for its first full
week of work. If enacted it' will
go into effect July 1, with the
beginning of the new fiscal
year.
Gov.,Tawes, who had earlier
refrained from outright in-
Idorsement of a Legislative
Council! bill to increase the
State cigarette tax, came out
for it over the week end. IIe
said the measure is "only rea-
sonable" and, will provide sub«
divisions with needed revenue in
addition to giving cigarete inan-
ufac6urers the uniform State
tax they now want.
~' The cigarette tax, bill would
repeal all local and Statp levies
t`( now in existence and replace
~(&gt; them with, a new State tax of' 6'
~ cents a pack„with half, to go toi
the State treasury and the other,
~ lialf back to subdivisions.
Y~ Tobacco Area Against.
~ Its main opponents will come I
~ from t'obacco-growine Southern
Marylandi They bitterly fought'
Q the State's entering the cig-
arette arette tax field in 1957' when
It levied 3' cents a pack to fi'-
nance a school teacher pay
raise.
The State does not stand' to
gain anything from the meas-
ure since it already, levies a tax
of 3 cents per pack. Balt;imore,
City andi Baltimore County also.,
have 3-cent levies. making, the:
total tax on cigarettes 6' centsl
In these two subdiivisions.
Stnokers there would continuee
paying the same aihount: • '
In_ other subdivSsions, there
would be t'ax increases ranging
from 1 or 2 cents in the few
counties which have their own
local levies to 3 cents in thosee
counties which now have no
local tax. The great majority
of counties do not levy the
tax. Montgomery County
levies a 2-cent tax and! would
stand to gain $250,020 a year
through the State cigarette
tax increase. Prince Georges
at .prescent imposes no local
levy on cigarettes and would
gain about $1 million a year.
The bill provides for return-
ing the new revenue, estimated
at about $5' million; to subdi!-
visions on the basis of' what
they now tax and! in proportion
'to their populations,
A detailed breakdown on the
proposed redistributdon is not
available.
Another Tax Separate.
Separate from the cigarette
tax bill'is anadministration tax
for financing $10 million in new
State aidlto subdivisions for ed-
ucation and welfare programs.
The Governor has not said
ahat' form this tax will take,
but best guesses are he will go
along with fiscal advisers and
lower the sales t'ax starting
pmint' from purchases over 51
,cent's to those costing over 20
cents. The tax also would be
reapplied to restaurant meals,
pi incipa4ly those costing over
$1.25.
The chief alternative to this
is changing the exemption now
allowed for State income taxes
or applying a surtax to larger
incomes. The Governor's ad-
visers are said to feel this
might receive a chillier recep-
tion than adjusting the sales
tax.
The question on both levies
Is how the General Assembly
will go for enacting two taxes,
neither of which is absolutely
mandatory in, a year of' aurplus.

Dr. Mirick said that addi-

from ch~bn(c bronchitis and
other liang siImea~s. He added' that if the Health
Department
gets the funds it
is
seeking he will order a study
,of air samplings madr by the
city's Department of Air Pollu-
tion Control.
"We willi take samplings of
air at street levels, iniCentral
Park and at rooftop levels
throughout the city," he saidi
Noting medical evidence that

;-containing hydrocarbons-
are a cancer cause Dr. Mirick
continued :
"On some days New York Is
in worse condition than Los
Angeles. Sometimes It's 150 per
cent worse, as far as smog is
concerned.
"On the aveerage, Los Angeles
Is way ahead of New York, but
we are rapidly approaching
them: "
Dr. Miriak addedi that 80 per
cent of ground-level' pollution
Is eaused!by automobiic traffic,
and that' this is worsening as
New York's traffic grows.
"Incinerators In private
apartments or homes also add

to note these facts and to assume

Washington -- Two~separate research teams, working at opposite sides of

to cancer causation, it was'reported today in the publication Toba~cco and Heallth,
ssued by The Tobacco Iinstitute, Inc.

predict, lung,cancer "will reach a peak among,the white male population in the
foreseeable future and then start to decline." 1003538359
Another article cites a British pathologist's report that a large part

A British pathologist says that 95 percent of the increase in lung cancer

one correctly labelled 50 years ago."
Lung Cancer Causation
Bxposing, mice to both influenza virus and artificial smog, prodiiced lung
cancers similar to those found in hums.ns, reports a University of Southern

not produce cancer, the scientists told the American Association for Cancer

Common•
wealth of Vir-
ginia needed!
Bill Gold more revenue,.
- Or do they
simply switch
-j, ineir ouying
to an area
where prices
~ are lower?
4l For example,
it raised' its
liquor taxes. Liquor sales
promptly fell to such a point
that they produeedi less rev-
enue at the higher tax rate
, than they hadibeenproducing
- at the lbwer tax rate. Those
concerned with the lost rev-
. enue suggested that the Com-
monwealth switch back to its
lower tax rate.
But some people see dtmin-
lshing, sales as evidence that.
Virginians are drinking less.
Warren Wright of the ABC
Board, says the Board'has "ab-
solutely no intention"' of' re-
dtscing prices just to raise
more revenue. Its primary
function is not to produce
revenue but to promote
temperance.
In Maryland, attention Is
now centered on drinking's
oornpanion evil, smoking.
Gov. J. Millard Tawes has en-
dorsed a proposal to double
the state tax on cigarettes,
from 3 cents a pack to 6.
Since the Federal tax of 8
cents a pack must be paid in
addition to all local' taxes,
this would result in a retail
price of about 28' cents a
pack-14 cents for the cigar-
ettes, and 14' cents for taxes.
According to the Wright
. theory, these higher cigarette
taxes wouldl cause Maryland-
ers to smoke.1ess, just as
higher liquor taxes caused.
Virginians to drink less.
We newspaper people are
in abstemious lot,~ known for
o,pr abhorrence of'both drink-
ing and smoking, and I there•
fore applaud this official pol•
icy of' encouraging abstention
through taxation.
Unfortunately, there aree
sure to be a few troublemak,
ers who will be asking pro-
vocative questions. If' higher
taxes really do result' in less
drinking and smoking, why
do the various states need
laws barrine imports of lotiver-
priced whislq~ and~ cigarettes?'
Why do they maintain "bor-
der patrols"' and snoopers?'
Why has i it been said that at-
tendants at District liquor
stores are offered, bribes to
inform oni Maryland custom-
ers?
Is It possIble that people
keep right on, drinking and
smoYing despite high taxes,
but simply look for a new
place to buy their supplies?
No, I prefer to put my faith
in, the Wright' theory. The
border patrols are more pa-
triotic than economic. They
keep out cheaply made for-
ei,gn products like those sold
by underpaid workers in
District sweatshops. Every
state owes it to its citiiens to
protect them from this un-
American competition.

Since those days, tobacco has continued to be a target for attack

That is the nature of the plant itself. A'round 1750, the famed

, . , .. .
`Siwedish botanist, hinnaeus,'observed that if the seeds of all the tobacco

growing at the moment were to take root and mature, the surface of the ,

earth wouldinot be able to hold all the plants. Each ounce of tobacco

contains about 314,000 seeds. And, on an average, each seed will
.;a produce a plant that can provide about one million more seeds.
'tobacco seed increases its weight 20 million times in about five months
from germination to harvest. An acorn makes a comparablle increase in
hundred years.

John Ftolfe probably knew little about botany and cared less for

' such calculations. But the seeds he planted Por his harvest 350 years

ago produced an agxicultural: and industrial enterprise that has grown

Smokers outside Baltimore!
City and, Baltimore County face
increases up to 3 cents a pack
in the price they now pay for
cigarettes. The amount will
double in most counties from
the present 3 cents per pack
now leviedi by the State.
In addition, residents will
probably be paying about $10
million more a year in sales
taxes, chiefly on purchases un-
der 51 cents which are now
exempt.
Revenue from both levies will
be for the benefit of local gov-
ernments.
Legisl3ture Iteturns.
The probable tax program
began taking more 'definite
shape today as the 1951 Legis-
lature returned for its first full
week of work. If enacted it' will
go into effect July 1, with the
beginning of the new fiscal
year.
Gov.,Tawes, who had earlier
refrained from outright in-
Idorsement of a Legislative
Council! bill to increase the
State cigarette tax, came out
for it over the week end. IIe
said the measure is "only rea-
sonable" and, will provide sub«
divisions with needed revenue in
addition to giving cigarete inan-
ufac6urers the uniform State
tax they now want.
~' The cigarette tax, bill would
repeal all local and Statp levies
t`( now in existence and replace
~(&gt; them with, a new State tax of' 6'
~ cents a pack„with half, to go toi
the State treasury and the other,
~ lialf back to subdivisions.
Y~ Tobacco Area Against.
~ Its main opponents will come I
~ from t'obacco-growine Southern
Marylandi They bitterly fought'
Q the State's entering the cig-
arette arette tax field in 1957' when
It levied 3' cents a pack to fi'-
nance a school teacher pay
raise.
The State does not stand' to
gain anything from the meas-
ure since it already, levies a tax
of 3 cents per pack. Balt;imore,
City andi Baltimore County also.,
have 3-cent levies. making, the:
total tax on cigarettes 6' centsl
In these two subdiivisions.
Stnokers there would continuee
paying the same aihount: • '
In_ other subdivSsions, there
would be t'ax increases ranging
from 1 or 2 cents in the few
counties which have their own
local levies to 3 cents in thosee
counties which now have no
local tax. The great majority
of counties do not levy the
tax. Montgomery County
levies a 2-cent tax and! would
stand to gain $250,020 a year
through the State cigarette
tax increase. Prince Georges
at .prescent imposes no local
levy on cigarettes and would
gain about $1 million a year.
The bill provides for return-
ing the new revenue, estimated
at about $5' million; to subdi!-
visions on the basis of' what
they now tax and! in proportion
'to their populations,
A detailed breakdown on the
proposed redistributdon is not
available.
Another Tax Separate.
Separate from the cigarette
tax bill'is anadministration tax
for financing $10 million in new
State aidlto subdivisions for ed-
ucation and welfare programs.
The Governor has not said
ahat' form this tax will take,
but best guesses are he will go
along with fiscal advisers and
lower the sales t'ax starting
pmint' from purchases over 51
,cent's to those costing over 20
cents. The tax also would be
reapplied to restaurant meals,
pi incipa4ly those costing over
$1.25.
The chief alternative to this
is changing the exemption now
allowed for State income taxes
or applying a surtax to larger
incomes. The Governor's ad-
visers are said to feel this
might receive a chillier recep-
tion than adjusting the sales
tax.
The question on both levies
Is how the General Assembly
will go for enacting two taxes,
neither of which is absolutely
mandatory in, a year of' aurplus.

Two Tax Bites Soon
ANhLAPOLISi Jan. 9 (AP).,-
Prospects now appear strongl
that Maryland taxpayers willl
feel two tax bites, insteadi of'
,iust one, from the General As-
sembly's 90-day session whichi
opened last wepk.
Smokers outside Baltimore!
City and, Baltimore County face
increases up to 3 cents a pack
in the price they now pay for
cigarettes. The amount will
double in most counties from
the present 3 cents per pack
now leviedi by the State.
In addition, residents will
probably be paying about $10
million more a year in sales
taxes, chiefly on purchases un-
der 51 cents which are now
exempt.
Revenue from both levies will
be for the benefit of local gov-
ernments.
Legisl3ture Iteturns.
The probable tax program
began taking more 'definite
shape today as the 1951 Legis-
lature returned for its first full
week of work. If enacted it' will
go into effect July 1, with the
beginning of the new fiscal
year.
Gov.,Tawes, who had earlier
refrained from outright in-
Idorsement of a Legislative
Council! bill to increase the
State cigarette tax, came out
for it over the week end. IIe
said the measure is "only rea-
sonable" and, will provide sub«
divisions with needed revenue in
addition to giving cigarete inan-
ufac6urers the uniform State
tax they now want.
~' The cigarette tax, bill would
repeal all local and Statp levies
t`( now in existence and replace
~(&gt; them with, a new State tax of' 6'
~ cents a pack„with half, to go toi
the State treasury and the other,
~ lialf back to subdivisions.
Y~ Tobacco Area Against.
~ Its main opponents will come I
~ from t'obacco-growine Southern
Marylandi They bitterly fought'
Q the State's entering the cig-
arette arette tax field in 1957' when
It levied 3' cents a pack to fi'-
nance a school teacher pay
raise.
The State does not stand' to
gain anything from the meas-
ure since it already, levies a tax
of 3 cents per pack. Balt;imore,
City andi Baltimore County also.,
have 3-cent levies. making, the:
total tax on cigarettes 6' centsl
In these two subdiivisions.
Stnokers there would continuee
paying the same aihount: • '
In_ other subdivSsions, there
would be t'ax increases ranging
from 1 or 2 cents in the few
counties which have their own
local levies to 3 cents in thosee
counties which now have no
local tax. The great majority
of counties do not levy the
tax. Montgomery County
levies a 2-cent tax and! would
stand to gain $250,020 a year
through the State cigarette
tax increase. Prince Georges
at .prescent imposes no local
levy on cigarettes and would
gain about $1 million a year.
The bill provides for return-
ing the new revenue, estimated
at about $5' million; to subdi!-
visions on the basis of' what
they now tax and! in proportion
'to their populations,
A detailed breakdown on the
proposed redistributdon is not
available.
Another Tax Separate.
Separate from the cigarette
tax bill'is anadministration tax
for financing $10 million in new
State aidlto subdivisions for ed-
ucation and welfare programs.
The Governor has not said
ahat' form this tax will take,
but best guesses are he will go
along with fiscal advisers and
lower the sales t'ax starting
pmint' from purchases over 51
,cent's to those costing over 20
cents. The tax also would be
reapplied to restaurant meals,
pi incipa4ly those costing over
$1.25.
The chief alternative to this
is changing the exemption now
allowed for State income taxes
or applying a surtax to larger
incomes. The Governor's ad-
visers are said to feel this
might receive a chillier recep-
tion than adjusting the sales
tax.
The question on both levies
Is how the General Assembly
will go for enacting two taxes,
neither of which is absolutely
mandatory in, a year of' aurplus.

New Book on Voluntary Health Agencies

The Gentle Iegf.'ons -- by Pti chard Carter.' IDoubleday and Company, '(January, 1961).

...

s book surveys the history and operations of the nation's volunteer
health organizations. There are chapters on the American Cancer Society

and the American Heart Association.
_~ ~ ..:. .; J.r .4 ._ .~ ,..a t~ . ..
Author Carter describes the ACS decision, in 1954, to begin its an

smoking campaign as '.'courageous." He says (pages,163-164);;





"To exhort the nation to seek medical attention was one thing. To become
identified as a public spoilsport and, common scold was quite another.
~The society leadership was tempted to be conservative; nobody had yet

; proved that tobacco smoke caused lung cancer. Perhaps the society should

it ftlf Orftdl thttitilitindemon
waor acua proo.. so-peae sascal assocaoi-

:strated!in the survey. Or forget the whole unappetizing project.
-.'
. . , . . _.
"The society must be credited with plac3ng the conquest of cancer ahead
-; -of' all other considerations in deciding'to set its tobacco findings
": before the American public. Perhaps one should not applaud a voluntary
health association for being devoted to health and'being principled in
that devotion; nobody hails a parent-teacher group for being interested
in education. Yet, in the curiously cynical atmosphere of the contemporary

United States, when voluntary health associations are discussed more for
.their fund-raising,activities than their health contributi'ons, rationality
may be served by pointing out that the society decision to expose the
hazards of smoking,was courageous."
Carter devotes considerable space to the role of'Dr. Clarence Cook Little
when he was managing director of the cancer group. He describes how the


ACS changed from a professional group to a popular movement, and of
.. I~r. Little's subseqnzent resignati'on (pages 150-159).




In the chapter on the heart fund, Carter writes (pages 186-187):
~ f.~ 1 ..:..~. k . ~. ,..- ., . ,.., . . „


"...i'n 1959 (there) was lively internal debate over a resolution through
irhich the associ'atJon would have,urged high school children not to smoke.
The resolution finally was referred back to committee as too hortatory..
In 1960thP association announced that tobs.cco "was indeed under suspicion.
This was its first public observation of that fact.


"In this connection one should understand that many studies of smoking
shaw that the cardiovascular effects may be as saddening,as the pulmonary..
The assoc3ation's slowness to act on the informati'on is part and parcel ox''
professional conservatism, deriving from the irreproachable cautious
disciplines of science itself."
Carter notes that neither A~CS nor ARA achieved' major standing in the public
eyes until they changed from purely professional, medical groups to popular
movements with thousands of volunteer workers. Carter indicates that AHA
has retained more of the influence of the professionals, by comparison with
ACS.

But the tax man is still around, in great numbers. From colonial
days, the question of heavy taxes on tobacao have generated much heat an

bitterness.

Today, the increasing number of direct sales taxes
~

'_;on cigarettes, is placing an excessive economic burden on users of
. . , .
';tobacco products. In addition to the federal tax of 8 cents a pack, 47
I of the 50 states and the District of' Columbia have special cigarette
levi'es. Fourteen states increased their levies in 196]1.

G;overnment ofi'icials,,on all levels, could ask themselves if
this heavy tax burden might not hold inherent dangiers. There is a
- limit to the tax load that consumers and the tobacco economy should be
asked to carry.
It might be rememberedithat some 17 million Americans are dependent

.w
for part of their livelihood on tobacco. The goods and'services required.





for tobacco graving;, manufdcturingand distribution cut across the
industrial map of the nation. More than 1.5 million businesses share
in the tobaccoitrade as suppliers of construction, equipment, materials,
transportation, services, and as distributors and merchandisers. And
suppliers have their own suppliers.

Tobacco is grown in 21 of our states andimamufactured in 32 states.
And more land is required to grow the wood products used, to manufacture

and market cigarettes than is needed to grow the tobacco itself':

-Questions, asked were:
, "Do you smoke?" "Why?" (or

- This Associated Press story notedi Secrets,ry Ribicoff's past actions oa.
the tobacco price support program. -
By GEORGE BAZAIit .
HARTFOItD, Conn. (AP)-
Gov. Abraham A. Ribicoff was
the first man picked for a Cabi-
net post in the Kennedy admin-
istration. And he may play a
far more important role than
'is indicated by his new title:
secretary of health, education
and welfare.
F6r one thing, be's a most
persuasive fellow when he
.:. wants to get something done.
He has charmed thousands of'
Connecticut Republicans into
voting for a Democrat-him-
self: A Jew,,he has won the po•
litical' support of' a11i creeds in
Connecticut, a, Yankee state
where Protestants and Catho-
lics predominate.
The hattnakers of Danbury,
Conn., were happy to note that
someone had persuaded John F.
Kennedy to start wearing a hat
as president-elect. Kennedy says
it was Ribicoff~ who did! the per-
suading.
On vitally important matters
4oo,, Kennedy has found reward-
ing reasons for calling on the
counsel of Abraham Alexander
Ribicoff.
It was quite a climb for Ribi-
coff1 to, the seats of the mighty.
He was born 50 years ago of
poor, immigrant' parents in New
3ritain, Conn. He held a vari-
ety of oddijobs ds a boy, work-
ed for a hardware company,
went to New York University
for a year,, then to the Univer-
sity of Chicago Law School. He
graduated' wit'h, honors in 1933'3
and settled in Hartford to prac-
tice law.
He served two terms in the
State Legislature, where he was
voted successively the "most
promising" and "most able"
representative.
He served two terms as a
Hartford police court judge, two
terms as a congressman, and
when, tapped by Kennedy wass
in his second term as governor.
He barely won his first guber-
natorial campaign by 3,000!
votes. Four years later he won
by 246,000, the largest guberna-
torial plurality in Connecticut's
history.
It' was while in Congress, that
Ribicoff and Kennedy, another
young New England conaucss-
man, became friends.
Rflbicoff l is a dark-eyed, hand-
some man with thick black hair
now streaked with gray. He is
just under six feet tall, dresses
conservatively, is gentle and
mild in manner. But it took more
than good looks and charm for
Ribicoff to ~ win the kind of~ sup-
port' that' he has won in Con-
necticut.
He pressed long-time Demo-
cratic party, demands for
streamlining, state and county
government and the municipal'
court'system, for increased'aid&amp; to education and social serv-
ices. He held' that the fastest
route to,progress was down the
middle of' the roadi He arguedl
for moderationy compromise,,
cooperation.
Ribicoff is not an intiellectual'
in the generally accepted sense
of the word. His sense ef hu-
mor is mild, and he likes plain
talk. Most of dll; he is an intel-
ligent, practical politicion,,
more interested in achieving a
goal than in formulating it.
As a congressman, he op-
posed subsidies for tobacco
farmers in his own district and
a multimillion-dollar dam pro-
posed for his district.
He opposed the subsidies
because they "would grant
privileges tb the Association of
Tobacco Gbowers, wouldi wreck
farms and enrich a few cor-
porations." .
He opposed the dam because
he considered it a, part of a
pork barrel bill.
During his first term as gov-
ernor, Ribicoff became con-
cerned about the rising high-
way death tb11 in the state. He
orderedl that speeders lose
their licenses for 30 days after
a second, and indefinitely after
a third
There was opposition and
many persons thought that Rib-
icoff's career would be hurt.
But the death, rate fell steadily
for four years and the state
won wide acclaim.
In winning his first term as
governor, Ribicoff made his
"American dream" speech,
now a lpart of the political lore
of Connecticut. He saidi he had
become the victim of . uglyy
whispers and iumors:" But: he
added, he stilli believed! in the
American dream. '
That dream, he said, was
that any boy, no matter what
his economic, social or religious
background might, be, had the
right to aspire to _and achieve
•'anything open to anyone in
this great country of ours."
Ribicoff s personal tastes are
simple. He likes to walk. He
s plays golf, reads, listens to mu-
sic, goes to the theater: Hee
doesn 't smoke: He drink5 mod-
erately. His d6sk is uncluttered..
His wife is the former Ruth
Siegel of~ Hartford, a, petite and
popular woman. They met at aa
high school dance and went to-
gether for four years before
they were married.
The Ribicoffs have a daugh-
ter, Jane, 19, a studenE at a
junior college, and a son, Pe-
ter, an English teacher in a Cal-
ifornia high school.
When, Ribicoff graduated
from high school, his class-
mates put this inscription, under
his picture: "He profits most
who serveth well."

as follows:
". . Modern, textbooks of phar-

"Since a new branch of pharma,
cology-psychopharmacology-is de-

its stabilizing effects on psychic and

Papers in the monograph, discuss
experiments on such subjects as: the
absorption and fate of nicotine in the
human; pharmacological actions of
nicotine and tobacco smoke, the in-

South African Include Air Pollution,

Srnoking in Lung Cancer Study
Lung cancer appears to be due to
environmental factors, such as "the
air we breathe," a researcher told'
, the 6th International Congress of
Diseases of the Chest. He was report-
;;ing on his study of air pollk,thon and'
lung cancer in South Africa.
~~ ' Dr. Geoffrey Deansa~id he studied
many factors, incliiding the cigarette
'smoking patterns of lung, cancer
', patients and a control population.
',' , He said 89 percent of the lung
: cancer patients smoked an average of
311.7 cigarettes a, day, while 79' per-
cent of the controls smoked 25.2 a
day.
,"Not a very big difference," said
Dr. Dean„ senior honorary physician.
. at Eastern Cape Provincial Hospital,,
:,Port Elizabet'hy South Africa.
He reported a higher percentage of'
the lung cancer patients in the study
"had a past history of bronchitis than
those who died from other causes"
and also "tended to drink more
heavily," on the average. .
"For the last 40, years the white
South African has smoked much
more heavily than the British and yet
the lung cancer rate amongst the
South African-born is less than half
the rate in Britain," he said.
"In South Africa the lung cancer
rate even for the South African-born
was very high, in one city, Durban,
where air pollution was a particu-
larly serious problem. Among the.
South African-born who died from
lung cancer, a higher percentage hadd
visited Britain than those wlio died
from other causes. Those immigrantss
who 'emigrated to South Africa at a
later age died on average at an
earlier age than those who erniaratedd
younger.
"In my opinion lung cancer would
appear to be due to environmental
factors-the air we breathe," Dr.
Dean said. "This is affected' by our
social environment, whether it is
urban or rural, the humidity, etc.,
and by a personali factor,, whether or
not we smoke. There may well be a
summation effect.
"This research suggests that too
much emphasis has been placed on
cigarette smoking as a possible bron+
chiali irritant and that polluted urban
air such as occurs in Britain, and
Durban makes a major contribution
to the rapidly increasing incidence of'
lung cancer:"

Augµst under auspices of the Ameri-
can College of Chest Physicians.

occurs may be considered contam-
i'r_ated by tuberculosis up to t'he age
of 30, at the latest," he saidi "Thus
we may assume that lymphonodogenic
bronchial lesions occur in practically
every patient affected by bronchial
cancer . . .
"Freshi lymphonodogenic lesions off
the bronchial wall-penetration andd
perforation foci-occur both in pri-
mary infections and during the devel-
opment of ehronic tuberculosis. . . .
We observed that bronchial' tumors,
especially malignant perforati'ons,
mo:3tly appear in perforative scars
some decades old," he wrote.
"There is no possible doubt con-
cerning, the fact that bronchial scars
of'tuberculous origin may serve as the
source of' malignant proliferations,"
Dr. Schwartz said.
"Other authors reportedi on numer-
ous observations in which malignant
tumors arose within old' tubercular
pulmonary foci, or in the bronchial
wall, at the leveli of calcified tuber=
cular lymph nodes."
Dr. Schwartz also said "We have to
stress that a predominant' etiologic
importance of' cigarette smoking is
not proved; on the contrary, it is
entirely improbable."'
In closing he wrote: "In view of all
these observations, and confronting
the fact' that it was not possible to
discover bronchial or pulmonary al-
terations obviously caused by cigarette
smoking, we should' have to ask
whether it is still legitiimate to ne~lect
the field of' solid and evident facts
for the sake of prosecution of a
chimerical theory."'

addition to an increase in the re•
corded dea ih rate for lung cancer in
the past several decades, there also
has been an increase in the per capita
consumption of cigarettes. Although
we may be sensitizedl to the fact that
this association may have no reall
bearing on cause and effect, whatl we
are less apt' to appreciate is that the
strength of the association itself can
be reduced by correcting, or aldbwing
for such factors as an aging, popula-
tion and an improvedi system of' re-
porting, selecting, and classifying,
causes of death and' that whatever
remains could be due at least in part
to improved diagnostic acumen,
methods, and' facili'ties and to an in-
creased awareness of cancer on the
part of the medical profession and
the public. r , -'
"The problem of' whether tobacco
is a cause of liing, cancer must remain
with us for some time ... The best
that can be said is that lung cancer
may have a rather d2verse etiology,"'
Dr. Saiger said.

tuberculosis decreases," they said..
"At the turn of the eentury, the
United States had about 200l deaths
per 100,000 frornl tuberculosis. If
the same proportion of the popula-
tion is susceptible to tuberculosis to-
day, and if 20 percent of this same
population is susceptible to broneha
genic carcinoma, then 40 per 100;000
might succumb to lung cancer when
tuberculosis is eradicated. This, of
course, is conjecture, but itl illustrates
that a further increase in broneho-
genic carcinoma may be expected,"
the scientists wrote.
The study showedi an increase in
the average age of'patients who died
from tuberculosis. "In 1944, the aver-
age age at death was 38 years, while
in 1957 it was 54 years. In other
words t'he tubercular patiient was ap-
proaching the 'cancer age' before
death."
It appears the two diseases are
"competing for the same person:
tuberculosis at an early age and
bronehogenic carcinoma as he grows
older;" they said.
"Iit should be expected that coun-
tries with a high incidence of tuber-
culosis would have a low incidence
of bronchogenic carcinoma and vice
versa, unless other factors are. pres-
ent,"' the scientists wrote.

Smoking Critics
'Play Down' Facts.

; Those who contend that tobacco
smoking may be a direct factor in
causing, lung cancer tend "to gloss
over, or play down facts which do not
~ fit their chosen hypothesis," says Dr.
"'Perrin HL Long,, editor of' Medical
Times.* 'r.. '' -. . .
"At times sweeping conclusions
have been drawn from &amp; type of ma-
terial which is subject to errory orr
bias, with the result that the data re-
ported has been suspects and the in-
terpretation of it considered faulty,"
said Dr. Long in an editorial' entitled
"Smoking and Lung Cancer (Too
Many Dogmatic Statements?) "'
"Otte thing which has character-
ized' views of some of' the protago-
nists of the thesis t'haU cigarette smok-
ing is the most important factor in
the production of lung cancer is their
myopic or parochial attitude towards
the problem;"' Dr. Lonb, said.
; "Smoking (and especially the
sirfoking of ciganet'tes), like drinkino,
is global in extent. Despite this, only
too frequently due to an emotional,
crusading, or punitive approach or to
nationalistic thinking,, or maybe be-
cause they are unable to see beyond'.
--their„noses, data adverse to the hypo-
thesis that cigarette smoking is the,
prime factor in the production of'
cancer of the hung is ignoned as
though it were an anti-social act to
consider it."'
He referred especially to a Novem-
ber 1959 report by ex-U~S, Surgeon
General Leroy Burney that claimed
the weight of er;dence implicates
smoking, as the priincipaL etiologicall
factor in the increase in lung cancer.
Said Dr. Long: "There is, in the
Surgeon General's pronouncement no
indication that data, han•e been pre-
sentedi by other inM1"estigators which
tend' to weaken the premier conclu-
sion ini his paper . . ."
Dr. Long pointed out t'hat' the Sur-
geon Genera!l' did not note the lack of
"unanimity of opinion on the part of
competent authorities relative to the
interpretation of some of the data
which he has presented.
"This„ we feel represents an un-
fortunately parochial attitude on the
part of an individual who by virtue
of his position should survey the
scene with Olympian detachment. In-
stead, he has taken up, the cudgels
and has become a partisan in the con-

TIRC Appropriates More Funds


The Tobacco Industry Research
Committee! has ~ increased its financial
support of' independent health reh search to broaden the scope of its
grant-in-aid program. Grants are
made by a Scientific Advisory Board.
The reason for the increase: Recent
research is opening up new areas that
need further investigation, such as
the possible role in cancer of viruses„
environmental factors and previous
lung damaaet and the constitutional
differences between smokers and non-
smokers, according to Dr. Clarence
Cook Little,, Scientific Director of the
Committee.
The annual TIRC appropriation
was increased from $500,000 to
$8010;f100! Since TIRC's inception in
1'9'54, research appropriations total
$4,650,000.
The extra funds were requested by
Dr. Little on behalf of the Scientific.
Advisory Board. He said, "We plan
to add certain lines of research and
expand' others."
. Some of the new research areas,
as outlined by Dr. Little, include:
1. The possible role of viruses in
cancer. Recent research sug,gests this
is a promising area for study. A re-
pont by Dr. Cecilie Leuchtenberger
and associates showed again that
smokino, mice don't get lung, cancer.
Her mice were exposed to cigarette
smoke daily for periods of one month
to almost two years. The work indi,
cated the possible influence of viruses
in damage to mouse lungs„Dr. Leuch-
tenberger said.
Last September five scientists re.
ported that viruses may play a role„
not yet fully defined, in eight forms
of transplantable hur:an cancer, in-
clud'inr lung cancer.
2. The possible role of' previous
lung infectimns, such as tuberculosis,
or injuries in the origin of lung can-
cer. The need for more research in
this area has been further emphasized
by such work as that of Dr. Philip.
Schwartz„ director of' the Warren
troversy. This assumption of an all
or none position by the Surgeoni Gen-
eral' is indeed astonishing in view of'
the infbrmation being reported,
which is in disagreement' with his
thesis."

dogmatic statements?)" Editorial, Medical'
Times, April 1960.

(Pa.) State Hospital. Dr. Schwartz
recent'1y, suggested that the increase X
in frequency of lung cancer in the ~
U.S. in recent decades may be largely
the result of' widespread tuberculosis
in previous decades. He observed that
lung, cancers often arise in bronchial
scars left by tuberculosis.
3. Studies of smokers and non+ "
smokers, including, the physiical, emo=
tional and psychological character-
istfies, as well as ethnic, social„ cul~
tural and ecologic differences. Dr.
H. J. Eysenck, of England, has re-
.portedl a study showing that smokers
are more extroverted than non-smok-
ers, "generally liwing it up more."
This led Dr. Eysenck to conclude that
"they (smokers), may thus (a) lower
their resistance to disease, and (b)
expose themselves more to conditions
which may directly cause the disease
in question."
Two Harvard University scientists,
Drs. Charles McArthur and C. W.
Heath; have reported constitutional
and I psychological differences between
smokers and non.smokers.-
4. Further studies of the influence
of ' environmental factors on the
bronchial lining. Recently, Dr. Geof?
frey Dean, of South Africa, told a
world meeting of chest experts t'hat'
some cases of lung cancer appear to
be due to environmental factors„ like
"
"
the air we lireathe.
Dr. Little said, "Literally hundreds
of studies have demonstrated the pos-
sible relation of multiple factors in
the complex chain that may result in
lung cancer. "
"This does not mean that any of
these factors necessarily cause lung,
cancer. Science does not know what
causes the disease."
Research has opened many doors
of knowledge, but it has also made
clear that much greater knowledge is
needed of the basic processes, includ-
ing individual differences in, suscep-
tibility, that cause lung cancer and
heart disease,, he said.
The Scientific Advisory Board to
TIRC is composed' of independent
doctors, scientists and educartors.. Itt
has awarded grants to 1i0'5 scientists
in hospitals„ medical schools and re-
search laboratiories. The scientists
have published more than, 135 papers
in medical and scientific journals re.
porting on their research.

They said that many people
think it' is too late for them to
give up the habit, but' the fact
is "smokers of cigarets, even
after long practice, will find It
beneficial to stop."
With a final statement, they
urged "all persons in responsible
positions, particularly parents,
teachers, physicians and nurses,
to note these facts and to assume
eir responsibility to teach the
th about the potentially hatm-
fuI effects •of cigaret smoking,
especially to our youth. Every
effort' should be made to discour•

"The death rate for smokers
of' all forms of tobacco Is 32 per

far, can be avoided only by I+70T'

They said that many people
think it' is too late for them to
give up the habit, but' the fact
is "smokers of cigarets, even
after long practice, will find It
beneficial to stop."
With a final statement, they
urged "all persons in responsible
positions, particularly parents,
teachers, physicians and nurses,
to note these facts and to assume
eir responsibility to teach the
th about the potentially hatm-
fuI effects •of cigaret smoking,
especially to our youth. Every
effort' should be made to discour•
age our youth from ever taking
up the practice of smoking ciga-
rets, or to encourage them to give
up this habit which may not be
firmly fixed and before damage
is too severe."'

The film, "To Smoke or Not

luncheon meeting yesterday in
the Central YMCA, Reedi and

explained' that the meeting was

' Information and speakers of cigaret smokerss is consider-

Dr. Stowell and Dr. Gettemy
referred to a recent Ui S. Public
Health Service report which sub-
stantiates this statement:
"The death rate for smokers
of' all forms of tobacco Is 32 per
cent' higher, and for smokers of
cigarets only is 78 per cent higher
than the death rate of non-smok-
ers;, that 1l1 times as many smok-
ers as non-smnkers die of lung
cancer; that the death rate from
coronary heart disease among
regular users of cigarets is 63

non-smckers; and' that the moree
one smokes the greater is the
risk of dying from any of these

Writing in the Journal of the American Medical Assoo-
Ciationi Drs. Broda 0. Barnes and' Max Ratzenhoffer
said more persons were surviving TB early in life only to
contract lung cancer, in their later years. ~: ol;-
They predicted that "a large increase" in lung tancer '
couldl be expected as tuberculosis deaths continue to "
decline.

Their conclusions were sed on datt
autopsies performed during the past 15 years at the Utti ,~'

The study showed that "a great reduction in tuber ~~ ~".:

"It' should be expected that countries with a high

"At t'he' turn of the century, ; the United States
