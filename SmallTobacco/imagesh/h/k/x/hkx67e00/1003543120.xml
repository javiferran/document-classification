Tobacco-health
report may
e watered down
There is increasing speculation that the U.S. Surgeon General's re=
port on the health effects of cigarettes may be a bland one. All action
against' cigarette advertisers has been held in abeyance until the report,
due late this year, is released. The Federal Trade Commission, for
example, is waiting to take its clue from the report. If the report verifies
the link between smoking and lung cancer and heart ailments, the FTC
could require "full disclosure" of the dangers in advertising and ciga-
rette rette labeling. It is also possible that the Federal Communications
Commission would find cigarette ads not in the public interest.

But the political implications of governmental action against
tobacco are massive to ponder. Tobacco, of course, is a staple of the
economies of a number of southern states whose Congressmen con-
trol many of the important committees of the Senate and House. More
than three-million workers depend on tobacco for their livelihood.
Moreover, more than $3-billion in tobacco taxes are collected each
year by federal, state and local governments. "
tl~ls
•
With these behind-the-scenes considerations, the general teeling
is that the Surgeon General's committee will have to be unflinchingly
convinced of the health dangers of smoking before recommending any
stringent government actions. Lingering doubts have forestalled a
governmental crackdown in the past, and it looks as if this may well
be the case again. The Tobacco Institute, representing the tobacco
industry, is doing its best to keep the doubts alive. Just this. week it
was disseminating rerort$ of three scientists who separately have
questioned the link.

Where's the Smoking Study?
One year ago, at President Kennedy's request,
the -UnitPd States Surgeon General appointed
a 10-member Special Advisory Committee on
Smoking and Health. Its job was to examine all
the evidence about the dangers of smoking and
then let the public know its conclusions. Where
is the report?
The cancer societies and physicians' organ-
izations in this country, Canada and England
continually issue stronger statements declaring
that there is a causative link between heavy
cigarette smoking and lung cancer. The Tobacco
Institute, Inc., which represents the major Amer-
ican tobacco and cigarette companies, counters
these reports by calling them "emotional" and
mere "theories: " '
That is why the American public Is impatiently
awaiting the Surgeon General's own report in
clear and unequivocal language. This is a matter
of public health and• great urgency. All of us,
smokers and nonsmokers, want to know the
answers from the official Federal Government
agency charged with this responsibility.
~od3
There should be no further stalling-theree
has already been too much-and no pulling of
punches. Health Secretary Anthony J. Cele-
brezze's initial statement that "it is not' the
proper function of the Federal Government to
tell citizens to stop smoking" hardly sounded
like a clarion call for urgency.
The Surgeon General's study should be re-
leased this year because it is an evaluation
report, not an action report. Even if it does
say that the public's health is adversely affected
by smoking, another committee will then have
to be set up to propose the action the Federal
Government should take.
Six years ago, the United States Public Health
Service decided on its own that the weight of
evidence pointed to the conclusion that "exces-
sive smoking is one of the causative factors In
lung cancer." Since then many responsible pri-
vate organizations here and abroad have said
the same thing. That is why the Surgeon Gen-
eral's office ought to get its smoking study out
soon. Public health is a public responsibility.

The medical staffl at Michael

a suggestion of its executive
committee that cigaret sales be

A Burning Question
The Tobacco Institute, Inc., which has
been attemptnng to allay. , the fears of
'cigaret smokers for a number of years
now, says that three medical scientists,
all recognized experts in their fieklir;
have raised a varlsttx of biological, st,1-
tist9cal and psychological reasons foi•
questioning the theory linking ri~arcf
smoking to lung cancer. The thrcc sci-
entists are a California lung specialisi. a~
Mayo Clinic medical statistician, and a
Scottish physician and psychologist.
Dr. Leroy Hyde, chief of pulmonary
~ riisease service, Veterans Administration,
Hospital, Long Beach, Calif., summarizes
a variety of reasons for his belief that
"the causal relationship of, cigaret smok-
ing to lung cancer is certainly unproved"
and that the cigaret theory may actually
be impeding lung cancer research. The
real causes, he maintains, are unknown.
Dr. Hyde's views appeared in the June,
pie of the Tobacco Institute know that
the weight of •medical opinion is
against them.
- * * *
All of this underlines the fact that the
tobacco people are in a nasty spot, and
it's getting nastier.
Research to discover the specific
elements in tobacco which cause can-
cer of the lung and throat area is be-
.coming more and more intensive. It
cannot be known how close, at any giv-
en time, researchers are in their
search. But when and if a break-
through comes, when and if one or more
substances in tobacco can be identified
as causative factors the industry must
then either remove the elements, if
'possible, or face extinction.
We fully sympathize with the tobacco
industry's predicament. But' we don't
think it helps its cause to cast about
for isolated experts willing to express
doubt about tobacco's role in disease.
* * *
It would 'be better, by far, to use
whatever money is available to join in
cancer and heart research, identify the
villain factors and get rid of them as
quickly as,possible.-
1963 issue of California Medicine. Among
his reasons for doubt were: Death rates
for Iung cancer among city dwellers are
higher than among people in rural arPas;
irrespective of smoking habits; lung can-
cer rates in Great' Britain are twice as
high as in the U.S., though UiS. cigaret
consuription per person is twice as great
as that of the British, and smokers have
been shown to differ from non-smokers
in more than 20 different ways, any one
of which might have more bearing on the
lung cancer problem than smoking itself.
While Dr. Hyde says "There is no
doubt that cigaret smoking may be
harmful for certain people," such ass
those with~ asthma or emphysema, he
concludes that the role of smoking in
lunb cancer is still an open question.
Dr. Joseph Berkson, chief medical
statistician of the Mayo Clinic, said:
"Personally, all relevant available faca•
tors considered, I think it very doubtful'
that smoking causes lung cancer." It is
"a distinct and real possibility," Dr.
Berkson said in the May-June issue of
The Cancer Bulletin+ that the results of
Statistical studies implicating smoking
"stem from a statistical fallacy" in the
data. "Even strong contenders of the
smoking-lung cancer theory no longer be-
lieve that the cancer is produced by
carcinogens (cancer-causing agents) con-
tained in tobacco smoke. The whole fab-
ric of ine original theory has broken
down and virtually beer abandoned," he
added.
The Scottish expert, Dr. David M..
Kissen of the University of Glasgow, has
found new evidej;ee of a personality pat-
tern common to male lung cancer pa-
tients. tients. The pattern begins in childhood,
according to Dr. Kissen, and does not
appear to be related to smoking habits.
Such patients, Dr. Kissen wrote in the
British Journal of Medical Psychology,
tend to bottle up or coriceaI their emo-
tional problems. In addition, fewer lung
cancer patients showed_ a history of child-
hood behavior troubles. The findings
raise many still unanswered questions,.
Dr. Kissen said, but they are consistent
with the theory that lung cancer may
have many causes, not j'ust one.
Our thinking has been along these lines
all along. That is, a cup of water when
you are thirsty is fine, but a gallon might
drown you.

60 Smokers Join CIinic to Break the Cigarette Habit

Cigarettes crept back today
into the lives of a few of the
60 men participating in an
experimental., clinic to help
them quit smoking perma-
nently.
Despite determination,,
drugs and the encouragement
of the group, at least two
men resumed smoking but
they smoked less than before
the test began two days ago.
They plan to continue to
try to quit, however. The
clinic has 28 more days to
run.
If pne-third of the 60 men
Temain nonsmokers six
months frorn now, Roswell
Park Memorial Institute will
consider the clinic a success.
The inst'itute, a state-spon-
sored cancer-research center,
will then help other groups
Iar clmics. Rosewell Park
considers cigarette - smoking
a major cause of lung cancer.
The volunteers come from
all walks of life. They all
want to step smoking and
they want help. Nearly all
have tried to quit before.
To make the task of the
will easier, Roswell Park has
supplied the volunteers with
lobeline„ a nicotine substitute
the doctors hope will ease
the craving for tobacco.
The men take a lobeline
tablet morning and evening.
When the cigarette urge be-
comes nearly unbearable, the
men are equipped with loz-
enges containing lobeline and
enough cinnamon to slightly
deaden the tongue for awhile.
Lobeline is a drug that oc-
curs in the lobelia plant and
also is manufactured synthet-
ically. The synthetic product
Is used in the test. Lobeline
affects the body in approxi-
mately the same way as nico-
t'ine but to a lesser degree. The
effects include constriction of
blood vessels, stimulation of
the central nervous system
and increased gastric secre-
t:ons. Roswell Park physicians
say there is no evidance that
lobeline is habit-forming.
One participant, who Is 31
years old and who has been
smoking for 15 years, found
the lozenges a.sturdy crutch
in those bleak moments wheJt
a cigarette appeared almost
irresistible.
A similar report came from
Arnold Winer, 28-year-old
teacher.
"While driving to work to-
day, I got the crazy desire
for a smoke," he reported.
"I wanted one so badly. I put
a lozenge in my mouth and
I didn't want a cigaret'te."

~ INSIDE WASHINGTON
Tobacco-health
report may
e watered down
There is increasing speculation that the U.S. Surgeon General's re=
port on the health effects of cigarettes may be a bland one. All action
against' cigarette advertisers has been held in abeyance until the report,
due late this year, is released. The Federal Trade Commission, for
example, is waiting to take its clue from the report. If the report verifies
the link between smoking and lung cancer and heart ailments, the FTC
could require "full disclosure" of the dangers in advertising and ciga-
rette rette labeling. It is also possible that the Federal Communications
Commission would find cigarette ads not in the public interest.

But the political implications of governmental action against
tobacco are massive to ponder. Tobacco, of course, is a staple of the
economies of a number of southern states whose Congressmen con-
trol many of the important committees of the Senate and House. More
than three-million workers depend on tobacco for their livelihood.
Moreover, more than $3-billion in tobacco taxes are collected each
year by federal, state and local governments. "
tl~ls
•
With these behind-the-scenes considerations, the general teeling
is that the Surgeon General's committee will have to be unflinchingly
convinced of the health dangers of smoking before recommending any
stringent government actions. Lingering doubts have forestalled a
governmental crackdown in the past, and it looks as if this may well
be the case again. The Tobacco Institute, representing the tobacco
industry, is doing its best to keep the doubts alive. Just this. week it
was disseminating rerort$ of three scientists who separately have
questioned the link.

Where's the Smoking Study?
One year ago, at President Kennedy's request,
the -UnitPd States Surgeon General appointed
a 10-member Special Advisory Committee on
Smoking and Health. Its job was to examine all
the evidence about the dangers of smoking and
then let the public know its conclusions. Where
is the report?
The cancer societies and physicians' organ-
izations in this country, Canada and England
continually issue stronger statements declaring
that there is a causative link between heavy
cigarette smoking and lung cancer. The Tobacco
Institute, Inc., which represents the major Amer-
ican tobacco and cigarette companies, counters
these reports by calling them "emotional" and
mere "theories: " '
That is why the American public Is impatiently
awaiting the Surgeon General's own report in
clear and unequivocal language. This is a matter
of public health and• great urgency. All of us,
smokers and nonsmokers, want to know the
answers from the official Federal Government
agency charged with this responsibility.
~od3
There should be no further stalling-theree
has already been too much-and no pulling of
punches. Health Secretary Anthony J. Cele-
brezze's initial statement that "it is not' the
proper function of the Federal Government to
tell citizens to stop smoking" hardly sounded
like a clarion call for urgency.
The Surgeon General's study should be re-
leased this year because it is an evaluation
report, not an action report. Even if it does
say that the public's health is adversely affected
by smoking, another committee will then have
to be set up to propose the action the Federal
Government should take.
Six years ago, the United States Public Health
Service decided on its own that the weight of
evidence pointed to the conclusion that "exces-
sive smoking is one of the causative factors In
lung cancer." Since then many responsible pri-
vate organizations here and abroad have said
the same thing. That is why the Surgeon Gen-
eral's office ought to get its smoking study out
soon. Public health is a public responsibility.

male lung cancer patients. He
said it begins in childhood and
does not appear related to smok-

Kissen reported, tend to bottle up

Cigarette 1/Varning Requested
BUFFALO, Sept,.16 IUPI)-
A representative vof Roswell
Park Memorial. list+titute here
asked seven leading cigareft.e
manufacturers today iw ..:..:.._
their product "Warning, exces-
sive use is dangerous to health."
The request was made by Dr.
Morton L. Levin, chairman on
an institute committee on cig-
:e tute today called upon cigarette
manufacturers to take voluntary
measures to minimize the health
hazards of cigarette srricking.
In a letter to the seven major
tobacco companies, Dr. Morton
L Levin, chairman of the insti-
tute's Cigarette Cancer Commit.
tee, outlined a plan to label ciga-
rette packages with a statement,
"Warning, Excessive Use is Dan-I
gerous to Heaith." '
The seven company presidents
to receive letters were: Morgan'
J. Cramer, P. Lorillard Co.; Jo-
seph seph F. Cullman III, Philip Mor-
ris ris Co.; Za&amp; Toms, Liegett.My-
ers Tobacco Co.; A. H. Galloway,1
R. J. Reynolds Co.; A. B. Walk-
er, American Tobacco Co; Wil-'i
liam S. Cutchins, Brown and WO-
liamson Tobacco Co., and. L.' A.
Bantle, United States Tobacco Co.
An empty cigarette package of
a brand produced by each of the
• companies was attached to the
letters. A special adhesive label
in fluorescent red with b 1 a c k
warning letters was placed on the
packages. Dr. Levin urged the
- - cigaretde industry to seriously
consider such a label and to vo1-
untarily place a health warning
on all their packs. ,
The chairman said the Rosweli
Park Cigarette Cancer Committee
believes that the industry prefers
to take voluntary measures to
control the health hazards.
The letter outlined the scientific
evidence over the past 20 years
which shows an "alarn-,:,-ig inf
crease in deaths from lung can-

In the tobacco and health controversy is
incorrect, the U.S. Public Health Service
` said Tuesday in a telephone statement
for the Durham Morning Herald.
The health service issued its statement
in Washington on behalf of the U.S. Sur-
geon General's Advisory Committee on
Smoking and Health, which is conducting
t survey of tobacco-and-health informa-
on.'
it came • in response to a published re-
port that anticipated federal action to
'=discourage tobacco usage and to regulate
advertising or marketing of tobacco prod-
Ucts.
Dire predictions about the unfinished
advisory committee report were written
In the Sept. 13 Kiplinger Agriculture Let-
ter, a newsletter circulated only among
subscribers. In reaction, Wall Street wit-
nessed a surge of selling in tobacco com-
pany stocks.
Without'naming the publication, the health
service said: "The newsletter's statement
that a series of governmental actions are
now being contemplated is not correct.
"Such recommendations do not fall
within the purview of the committee,
.whose sole purpose is to assemble and
publish the facts concerning the relation-
ship between smoking and heslth."
The heaiih service also specifically de-
nied that the coiamittee's report would
be submitted "in a few weeks." as re-
ported' by the KiplingPr publicati ;n,' "The
so-called 'finai' report cited in the news-
letter does not' exist even in preliminary
form." the health service said.
"The committee's report is scheduled
I
for completion and submission to the sur-
geon general by the end of 1963 . . . No
section of the report will be released be-
fore completion of the total report6" it
added. -
In addition to the formal statement, a
health service source told the Durham
Morning Herald that the committee will
not make recommendations for action by
other agencies, by either administrative
decree or legislative act.
Such recommendations, the source said,
have been designated as phase two of the
over=ail tobacco-and-health progtam. How
phase two will be conducted and by whom
has not yet been firmed up and certainly
will not begin until after the present com-
mittee makes its report, the source added.
The newsletter, referring to behind-th&amp;
scenes information, said the committee's
report "will damage the huge tobacco in-
dustry and scare people if issued as-is,"'
It predicted that smoking will be dis-
couraged right away and that the govern-
ment will actively discourage smoking,
possibly with a ban on cigarette advertis-
ing through administrative action by the
Federal Communications Commission.
The picture is not yet firm, the ncv: s-
letter added, on possible labeling require-
ments for tobacco products. It predicted
that' the committee report would kick
off a nationwide campaign abetted by gov-
ernment agencies and private groups.
Reaction was felt on Wall Street Mon-
day. The New York Times reported in-
vestors apparently "apprehensive of ihe
Coming Government report," and cited the
newsletter.
Two tobacco stocks, American and
Reynolds were on the New York Stock
h;acchange list of most active issues. Trad-
0
ers swapped 48,400 shares of Americad,
with the stock closing off ~k. Reynolds
and Lorillard droppesd 1% over . they{t:i~
vious trading day.
Tuesday, Philip Morris dropped I%;"
the other tobacco issues showed less move-
ment, Lorillard even closing up 3/4. '
Also in the tobacco-and-health picGire
is a book, scheduled for release in ,Oc
tober, by Sen. Maurine B. Neuberger, "Df-
Ore., entitled "Smoke Screen: Tobacco
and Public Welfare."' Mrs. Neuherger has
said she will, press for administrative a&lt;:=;',
tion and "remedial legislation" to regulate .;:
tobacco products. t&lt; ~i
The senator said she would• begin her;
campaign "as soon as the advisot•y rtmr
.,
mittee has lodged its report." Sen. heu-.,
berger envisions' educational programs on4,
tobacco hazards to health, requirements
to make advertisements warn of health
hazards and labeling requirements to in-
clude warnings and tar and nicotine yields
or ratings.
Speaking on the floor of the Senate last .
June 20, $en. Neuberger cited as "a sig.
,
nificant start" the tobacco companies self-
initiated restriction of -TV advertising to 4
.late-night hours and their dropping of
in
d
l
p
school and col.Iege pub
ications.. q;;.
s
• The advisory committee is composed cf,
scientists who are surveying the worldwide
' literature published on tobacco and health.
Its report is expected to be written ln
scientific language, the full impact of .
'whieh likely will have to be translated ~ j k
`
into lbymen's terms.
• The committee is not conducting re-
search of. its own. What conclusions it
will, draw, if any, is still a wide-open ques-
,tion, to be answered only when the •re-
port is submitted at the end of the year.
No interim reports-which might give ad-
vance warning-are contemplated.

bage, it seems, but also a variety of vegetables and flowers-and ever
crabgrass. Though the latter ingredient promises to make our backyar:
a rich source of income should tobaccoless cigarettes catch on, cando;

velopment of these cigarettes has been carried on at an important can-

A Burning Question
The Tobacco Institute, Inc., which has
been attemptnng to allay. , the fears of
'cigaret smokers for a number of years
now, says that three medical scientists,
all recognized experts in their fieklir;
have raised a varlsttx of biological, st,1-
tist9cal and psychological reasons foi•
questioning the theory linking ri~arcf
smoking to lung cancer. The thrcc sci-
entists are a California lung specialisi. a~
Mayo Clinic medical statistician, and a
Scottish physician and psychologist.
Dr. Leroy Hyde, chief of pulmonary
~ riisease service, Veterans Administration,
Hospital, Long Beach, Calif., summarizes
a variety of reasons for his belief that
"the causal relationship of, cigaret smok-
ing to lung cancer is certainly unproved"
and that the cigaret theory may actually
be impeding lung cancer research. The
real causes, he maintains, are unknown.
Dr. Hyde's views appeared in the June,
pie of the Tobacco Institute know that
the weight of •medical opinion is
against them.
- * * *
All of this underlines the fact that the
tobacco people are in a nasty spot, and
it's getting nastier.
Research to discover the specific
elements in tobacco which cause can-
cer of the lung and throat area is be-
.coming more and more intensive. It
cannot be known how close, at any giv-
en time, researchers are in their
search. But when and if a break-
through comes, when and if one or more
substances in tobacco can be identified
as causative factors the industry must
then either remove the elements, if
'possible, or face extinction.
We fully sympathize with the tobacco
industry's predicament. But' we don't
think it helps its cause to cast about
for isolated experts willing to express
doubt about tobacco's role in disease.
* * *
It would 'be better, by far, to use
whatever money is available to join in
cancer and heart research, identify the
villain factors and get rid of them as
quickly as,possible.-
1963 issue of California Medicine. Among
his reasons for doubt were: Death rates
for Iung cancer among city dwellers are
higher than among people in rural arPas;
irrespective of smoking habits; lung can-
cer rates in Great' Britain are twice as
high as in the U.S., though UiS. cigaret
consuription per person is twice as great
as that of the British, and smokers have
been shown to differ from non-smokers
in more than 20 different ways, any one
of which might have more bearing on the
lung cancer problem than smoking itself.
While Dr. Hyde says "There is no
doubt that cigaret smoking may be
harmful for certain people," such ass
those with~ asthma or emphysema, he
concludes that the role of smoking in
lunb cancer is still an open question.
Dr. Joseph Berkson, chief medical
statistician of the Mayo Clinic, said:
"Personally, all relevant available faca•
tors considered, I think it very doubtful'
that smoking causes lung cancer." It is
"a distinct and real possibility," Dr.
Berkson said in the May-June issue of
The Cancer Bulletin+ that the results of
Statistical studies implicating smoking
"stem from a statistical fallacy" in the
data. "Even strong contenders of the
smoking-lung cancer theory no longer be-
lieve that the cancer is produced by
carcinogens (cancer-causing agents) con-
tained in tobacco smoke. The whole fab-
ric of ine original theory has broken
down and virtually beer abandoned," he
added.
The Scottish expert, Dr. David M..
Kissen of the University of Glasgow, has
found new evidej;ee of a personality pat-
tern common to male lung cancer pa-
tients. tients. The pattern begins in childhood,
according to Dr. Kissen, and does not
appear to be related to smoking habits.
Such patients, Dr. Kissen wrote in the
British Journal of Medical Psychology,
tend to bottle up or coriceaI their emo-
tional problems. In addition, fewer lung
cancer patients showed_ a history of child-
hood behavior troubles. The findings
raise many still unanswered questions,.
Dr. Kissen said, but they are consistent
with the theory that lung cancer may
have many causes, not j'ust one.
Our thinking has been along these lines
all along. That is, a cup of water when
you are thirsty is fine, but a gallon might
drown you.

Futile Search
•
M AYBE there isn't anything worse
than lung cancer, but we'd say
a lifetime of smoking cigarets made
of c a b b a g e, beet and dandelion
leaves would come close.
This is reported to be the most
popular blend achieved so far by
some researchers at Buffalo who are
trying, to find a non-suspect' substi-
tute for tobacco which'"will satisfy
the desire to smoke. Besides beets,
cabbage and dandelions, they have
experimented with petunias, crab-
grass and a number of other likely
plants, presumably without results
worth writing home about.
It may be that we can help them a
little on this project. In our early
youth we, along with m o s t other

lines. If the Buffalo scientists haven't
tried cornsilk, coffee g r o u n d s, a
weed we used to call "Indian tobac-
co", and buggy whip-never mind.
We doubt that they ever would prove
as popular as the cabbage-beet-dan-
delion blend; even through a six-foot
filter.
To tell the truth, we are far from
sanguine about the prospects of find-

tobacco. Conceivably they w o u 1 d

wouldn't bother laboratory mice, but

WCAM had carried about seven or

OBJECTIVES - The Surgeon

on its review of all available
tobacco-health information.
Its aim is w ctear the air -
not necessarily of smoke ringss
but of the cloud of varied and
sometimes confusing reports on
tobacco and'health. In collecting
data it can hardly escape draw-
ing conclusions, either explicit-

LETTERS To The EDITOR
W * Yt
Smolang and Research
Editor, The National Observer:
I read with interest your article in The
National, Observer for Aug. 5 which dis-
cusses Dr. George E. Moore and his views
on tobacco use and human health. Since
this article makes reference to the To-
bacco Industry Research Committee, per-
haps I may comment on it.
The article quotes Dr. Moore as say-
ing that the Tobacco Industry Research
Committee grants to him~ "ended when
the institut'e couldn't agree with the indus-
try committee on what should be studied."'
This statement might' be misunder-
stood to suggest that some representative
of the tobacco industry was involved in
the decision to deny a grant application
from Dr. Moore's group. It' should be
explained that all policies on research and
all decisions with respect to grants are
made by a scientific advisory board carn*
pose&amp; of scientists and physicians uncon-
neeted with the tobacco industry, who per-
form this function as a public service.
Their decisions are final.
The board approved all applications
which Dr. Moore and his colleagues sub-
mitted for assistance in their studies In-
volving the inhaiation of cigaret smoke
by experimental' animals. This type of
study was, and is, a major interest. How-
ever, they eventually denied an applica
tion from Dr. Moore's group for support
of a project on another subject, reaching
this decision following a site visit and
report by one of this country's eminent
biochemists, who Is not a member of the
board but has served as a consultant to _
the board from time to time.
I hope these comments wi11 help to ,;
round out the picture. ='x

To Tarheels with a memory for dates and
those with an active interest in tobacco, Thursday
has more. meaning than just another work day-
it is an anniversary loaded with po-
tential significance.
Exactly a year ago, t~e U.S. sur-
geon general4 Dr. L'tither Terry, an-
nounced i-he formation of a commit-
tee to study "the itrtpact of smoking

the $8 billion-a-yearr tobacco indttstry

turers and tohacco u;er,,-hRve
holding their brea(h ever since.
Ten men subsequently wcrr
appointed and got organiu•d
late in October 1962. All of them
are recognized experts in their
fields, which ranGe from public
health and statistics to habit-
forming drugs and cancer. Ex-'

OBJECTIVES - The Surgeon
General's Advisory Committee
on Smoking and Health expects
to issue a report late this year
on its review of all available
tobacco-health information.
Its aim is w ctear the air -
not necessarily of smoke ringss
but of the cloud of varied and
sometimes confusing reports on
tobacco and'health. In collecting
data it can hardly escape draw-
ing conclusions, either explicit-
ly obvious from the information.

'1'he committee docsn't'plan
to conduct any original .. ie=
h
searc, but its members, scien=
tific backgrounds are needed to
assess the accuracy of existing
aGldies,
What will come from "
committee will be set down In
scientific language. When dita=
tilled for politicians "and othei
laymen, that language ` could
provide the basis for actfon.'

Proposals for action in the to~

as "the second phase."

It is financed not as a sepa-_- ;^';

; ions of Air Pollution and Chronic
Diseases of the U.S. Public

Most of the staff members are
on loan from (heir home agen-

for travel by the , committee
members and office expenses.

Tobacco exports total about 500 million dollars a year, against imports of
125 million. Tobacco thus contributes to an export surplus.
Governments also rely heavily on tobacco sales for revenue. Taxes on
tobacco products bring in more than 3 billions a year. Of that total, the

George V: Allen, president of
The Tobacco Institute, Inc., today
•• called' for a "respite from theo•
ries, resolutions and emotional
statements" about' smoking and
3tealth so long as the "theories re•
garding possible causes of lung
cancer and heart disease are in,

"Perhaps then the scientists can
~ determine the areas of research
~ that must be undertaken and work

!t~ 1ems," Allen said in a speech to
the NationaLL Association of State

~ About 50 department heads had

said, "there is some danger of los-

• necessary to find out what actual-
ly causes the diseases in question,
and what role, if any, tobacco may
play. "
. "Sheer Repetition
Allen said that "by sheer repeti-
tion," critics of smoking "are now
seeking to give the impression of
'mounting evidence' that' smoking
is responsible for various health
problems, even though the causes
of these problems remain in dis-
pute among scientists.
"Actually, while there have been
many resolutions and repeated
stories and articles about smoking
and health in the recent past;, the
scientific situation remains large-
ly as it was."
Allen saiu that "the litera.,,re
on tobacco and health contains
such a wide variety of fiction and'
non-fiction, fact and opinion, that
it is difficult, at best, to determine
what the facts rea'lly are.
"However, when one considers"
all of the available research, one
finds that much of it does not fit
the theory as presented by those
who regard smoking as a serious
health hazard.
"It is natural that the headlines
usually go to those who suggest a
possible answer to health prob-
lems, or who present a new theory
or who make a charge.
"However, 'a chorus of loud
voices saying that tobacco is
'guilty' is no substitute for re-
search.
"The position of the tobacco in-
-.'ustry; on the other hand, doess
not generally make much news,"
he said, because "we do not' pre-
sume to know the answers. ...
Certain Things
"There are certa:n things we
do know," Allen said:
"We do know that the theories
regarding possible causes of lung
cancer and heart disease are in
dispute among scientists.
"We do know that' the originat
theory about smoking and lung
cancer - the theory that smoke
was a'direct„ contact carcinogen-
has virtually been abandoned;
"We do know that in labora-
tories arotmd' the world scientists
are investigating many possible
factors in lung cancer and heart
disease, in addition to smoking."
Allen n o t e d that the "case
against smoking still rests largely
on statistical studies, whose mean-
ings are questicned by many lead-
ing medical statisticians."
He also said that "intensive
clinical znd laboratory research
has failed to provide the verifica-
tion necessary to show a cause
and effect role for smoking."

M AYBE there isn't anything worse

a lifetime of smoking cigarets made
of c a b b a g e, beet and dandelion

This is reported to be the most
popular blend achieved so far by
some researchers at Buffalo who are
trying, to find a non-suspect' substi-
tute for tobacco which'"will satisfy
the desire to smoke. Besides beets,
cabbage and dandelions, they have
experimented with petunias, crab-
grass and a number of other likely
plants, presumably without results
worth writing home about.
It may be that we can help them a
little on this project. In our early

B3!'a WALL STREET.TOIIRNALST6Q'RepoYCE1'CHICAGO-The vending machine industry
announced it wiIll launch a"self-regulation"
program to discourage cigaret sales to young
people through vending machines.
The six-step program includes the posting
of conspicuous decals on machines declaring
that sales to minors are unlawful. It will also
urge vending machine operators to place ma-
chines in spots where sales can be supervised
and suggests formation of local committees of
vending machine operators to press for enforce•
ment of laws pertaining to minors and tobacco.
The program was disclosed here at the
opening of the convention of the National Auto-
matic Merchandising Association, trade group
,tor the vending industry.
The association also released results of a
new survey of teen-age : r:okLlg, which showed,

smoke, more than 51cl'o said their motherss

inhalation of cigarette smoke is prob•
ably a cause of other serious 'and
widespread ailments, among them pul~
monary emphysema and coronary
heart disease.
Over 10 million people in the Unit-
ed States, most of them past 40, are
said to suffer from emphysema, a di•
sease that leaves its victims gasping
for breath, and the number is report-
edly on the rise.
One paragraph in particular in the
Mi11er-Monahan~ article sticks in the
mind. It reports the results of a test
of lung function administered to 600
smokers and non-smokers by Dr. Rog-
er Larson of the UCLA Medical School
in Los Angeles.
Dr. Larson found that the lungfunc-
tion of younger smokers who consum-
ed a pack a day or more was, about
equal to the lung function of non-
smokers who were 20 years older.

Survey Finds L.A.
Smog No Factor
in Mortality Rise
BY HARRY NELSON
Times Medical Editor
Ttso Loma Linda Univer-
rity physicians Wednesdacd blamed cigarette smokiiig
rather than Los Angeles
smog for an increase in
rnortaIity from a luiig
disease, emphysema.
Their conclusion is based
on a fiYe-year comparison of
d e a t h s from emphysema
among 63,000 California Sev-
enth-day Adventists and the
general population. Adven-
tists do not smoke.
"If air pollution of the Los
Angeles variety is a factor in
puhnonary emphysema, it
has not yet become apparent
In death statistics," declared
Drs: Frank R. Lemon and
Richard T T. 1VaIden. .
Increased Six-fold
Their reruarks appear ih
an article in the current
issue of "The Review and
Herald," an Adventist publi-
catiorr.
The authoiis pointed out
that the incidence of em
physema increased siY-fold
between 1950 and 1960. The
disease is characterized by a
lo," of elasticity of lung
tissues which makes it diffi-
cult for the individual to
exhale.
The physician found that
whereas 22 Adv.entists would
have been expected to diee
of' emphysema during, the
five-vear study, the[P were
only four sucii de:ith-.

In addition to the four
deaths where emphysema
was the primary cause.
there were 14 addit'ionall
deaths in which the lung
disease was a cor,tributin,-,
cause.
The physicians were able
to obtain life habit Informa

A1l' 10, they said, had beerr
smokers-nine on cigarette~
and one on cigars and
chewing tobacco - for an
average of 30 yeara before
becoming Adventists.
Statistics Cited
In incriminating smoking
rather than smog, Drs. Le-
mon and Walden cited 195^
statistics stating that only
42.10i'0 of California death=

LETTERS To The EDITOR
Smoking and Lung Cancer
Editor, The Nationad Observer:
Your comment on cigaret smoking
(July 29) Indicates a rather uncritical ac-
ceptance of a theory that has been re-
peated often. but remains unproven.
Y ou say "no one familiar with the ac-
cumulated findings can reasonablyy doubt
today that there is an Intimate connectionn
between heavy smoking and lung cancer."
I submit that the statement is far from
factual.
Scientists who are familiar with all the
findings do reasonably doubt the impor-
tance, If any, of the connection indicated
by statistical association studies.
"One of those scientists is Dr. Joseph
Berkson of the Mayo Clinic, one of the
leading statisticians in the field of medi-
cine. Dr. Berkson was a member of the
American Cancer Society Statistical Com-
mittee that authorized the Hammond-Horn
statistical study.on which most of the ac-
cusations against smoking are now based.
Dr. Berkson not' only doubts the conclus-
ions based on these studies; he rejects
S them. He recently wrote that it is "a dis-
tinct and real possibility" that the statis-
tical association between cigaret smok-
ing and health problems stems "from a
statisticai fallacy in the data." He also
said, "Personally, all relevant available
facts considered, I think it very doubtful
that smoking causes lung Cancer."'
Dr. Ian Macdonald, a California sur-
geon and former director of the American
Cancer Society, saidr "After more than a
decade of widespread effort, no signifi-
cant biologic evidence is forthcoming to
lend meaning to the statistical associa-
tion."
Dr. Leroy Hyde, chief of pulmonary
disease service at the Veterans Adminis-
tration Hospital in Long Beach, Calif., re-
cently published an article summarizing
28 reasons for his belief that smoking is
not an~ important causative factor in lung
cancer. He said: "The causal relationship
of cigaret smoking to lung cancer is cer-
tainly unproved."
Numerous other scientific references
can be cited.
In addition, you should know that
scientist's actually studying lung cancer
find "an intimate connection" between
nuraerous other factors and lung cancer.
For example, studies have shown an "in-
timate connection" between previous lung
ailments and lung cancer, between famil~
iar susceptibility and lung cancer, be-
o tween country of birth and lung cancer,
between hormones (sex) and lung cancer,
between lmproved diagnostic facilities and
better medical recognition and lung can-
cer, and even between the availability of
hospttal beds and doctors and lung car&gt;;
cer.
By stating that the case against smok-
irg Is, in effect, closed, you have pre-
sumed to settle questions that are unre-
solved in the scientific world.
The Tobacco Inst'.tazt'e Is vitally inter-
ested in determining the facts. The to•
bacco industry is itself supporting a con-
siderable research program through the
Tobacco Industry Research Committee,
and numerous research faciiities through-
out the nation are hard at work in a de-
termined effort to discover the answers
to these unsolved medical problems.

More Research for Tobacco
Editor, The National Observer:
Clarence Hotson's suggestion in your
Aug. 5 issue that the tobacco-cancer prob-
lem can be disposed of by legislating
tobacco out of existence sounds like
legislating corn out of existence because it
sometimes comes by the gallon instead
of the bushel.
What Is called' for Is research into the
still unexplored potentialities of tobacco.
In the South, tobacco stems are used as
a mulch and tobacco dust as an insect
repellent; for years there has been on the
national market a brand of nicotine prod-
ucts for agriculturai use. This may be a
way out for the tobacco interests when
they finally have to "give up smoking."

Right of Choice
Editor, The National Observer:
I have read with interest your ardic'.e,.
"Why Do People Crave Cigarets?" (Aug..
5). It is apparent thNt medical men and
their research staffs a.:e cor-utantly check•
ing ways and means to Increase their
already huge income.
When will the lesson of "Prohibition"'
be fully realized? Are we actually so
stupid as to be unaware that anything
carried on excessively is a health men-
ace? God gave us the right' of choice. Why
must man try to controL everything?

Educational Campaign
Editor, The National Observer:.
Relative to your editorial "Smoking
and Common Sense" (July 29)„ I concur
with you that the question now is what
to do about the cigaret controversy.
In Pennsylvania, positive action has
been taken by pharmacists. The Pennsyl-
vania Pharmaceutical Association has
.~..~~~
passed a resolution calling for an educa-
tional' campaign aimed at discouraging _
teen-agers from acquiring or persisting '
in the cigaret, habit.

CIGARET SMOKING has always been
one of those voluntary, personal
actions which a man considers to be
his own business. But the California
Department of r ublic Health has now
decided that this h a b i t should be
brought under strict government con-
trol.
Having r e a c h e d the conclusion
(questionable in itself) that cigaret
smoking is profoundly harmful to
health, the Department seeks an im-
mediate program of anti-cigaret edu-
cation, establishment of anti-smoking
clinics, new laws raising cigaret taxes,
restrictions on vending machines, and
lebis:ation banning smoking in public
places.

ment has not yet suggested placing a
TV camera in every living room to re-
port the occupants' conduct to Big
Brother, but that wilt no doubt come
later.
The• Department's proposals are the
product of the feeling, which so many
public officials eventually get, that
government is wiser and mueh better
qualified than the individual to run the
individual's life.
We think it is all right for a De-
partment of Health to study the ef-
fects of smoking and to publish find-
ings, but it's not the function of any
government agency to try to tell peo-
ple they shouldn't or can't smoke
cigareU.
IN DEFENSE OF THE TOBACCO MEN
Has it ever occurred to you~ that the tobacco
industry might be suffering under unfair restrictions
and criticism in regard to their advertising practices?
It is a theory-not conclusively proven as yet
-that smnking too much gives you lung cancer.
It is also a theory-pretty well established, too-
that eating too much of certain types of food makes
you tco fat. And over•weight is probably the great&lt;
est single health menace today.
(~ Seems that advertisers promoting calories might
do just as much damage with their copy and
'~ pictures as the cigarette advertisers.
Y manufacturers, manufactures, and their agencies,
m go to great length to describe the power under
'Q the hood of their latest' models. Which is America's
~ greatest killer? The automobile? Cancer? Or heart
~ trouble?
0
Other killers on the American scene are over
work and worry of executives. Most of the cases
resulting from these two oppcnents to good health~
result from the competition found in business today.
What develops your competiton s business more
than a good advertising campaign?
If the cigarette advertisers are geing to be.
limited in their advertising. and considered as crim,
inals for inducing the public to buy their product,
what about the adwertisers of cake mix?
Cake is certainly fattening. Overweight causes
heart trouble. Let's restrict the advertising of cake
mix along with cigarettez. And candy. And frozen
pies.
Television commtrcials show the latest sport
models climbing mountainous roads of dirt without
guard rails, or a young couple whisking across hill
and dale without benefit of road, to illustrate the
power of that particular bomb on wheels. Should
they be allbwed to suggest that the listeners go
out and .kill themselves by using all that power?
Now comes the overwork and' worry problem.
These two executive hazards cause ulcers, which
in turn cause a lot of trouble to business" men.
Let s restrict alli advertising so my ccmpetitor
won't become first in the Milwaukee market while
my campaign takes over the St. Louis housewives.
Then, my competitor won't worry about St. Louis
and I won't fret about Milwaukee. We'li- both
save ulcers and an early death.
Why are we taking it cut on the cigarette
people? They dbn't seem to be such horrible people
after all.

LETTERS To The EDITOR
W * Yt
Smolang and Research
Editor, The National Observer:
I read with interest your article in The
National, Observer for Aug. 5 which dis-
cusses Dr. George E. Moore and his views
on tobacco use and human health. Since
this article makes reference to the To-
bacco Industry Research Committee, per-
haps I may comment on it.
The article quotes Dr. Moore as say-
ing that the Tobacco Industry Research
Committee grants to him~ "ended when
the institut'e couldn't agree with the indus-
try committee on what should be studied."'
This statement might' be misunder-
stood to suggest that some representative
of the tobacco industry was involved in
the decision to deny a grant application
from Dr. Moore's group. It' should be
explained that all policies on research and
all decisions with respect to grants are
made by a scientific advisory board carn*
pose&amp; of scientists and physicians uncon-
neeted with the tobacco industry, who per-
form this function as a public service.
Their decisions are final.
The board approved all applications
which Dr. Moore and his colleagues sub-
mitted for assistance in their studies In-
volving the inhaiation of cigaret smoke
by experimental' animals. This type of
study was, and is, a major interest. How-
ever, they eventually denied an applica
tion from Dr. Moore's group for support
of a project on another subject, reaching
this decision following a site visit and
report by one of this country's eminent
biochemists, who Is not a member of the
board but has served as a consultant to _
the board from time to time.
I hope these comments wi11 help to ,;
round out the picture. ='x

Smoking Cancer Cause? Why Not Coffee?
By JULIAN DeVRIES
Medical Editor
The Arizona Republic
To smoke or not 'to smoke is
the question which isn't plaguing
millions of Americans.
. .
Despite surveys, studies and '
considered medical opinions on
the relationship of cigarette
smoking to lung cancer, ciga-
rette sales continue at their high
level in response to huc6ters"
exhortations, or in spite of them.
.In the May-June issue of The
Cancer Bulletin of the Univer-
sity of Texas M. D. Anderson
Hospital and Tumor Institute,
Dr; Joseph Berkson of the Mayo
QiniG in Rochester, Minn.,
writes that he believes the sta-
tistics purporting to show a
causal relationship between lung
cancer and cigarette smoking
are, to put it briefly, a lot of
baloney.
This is a refreshing view,
since Dr. Berkson is the ac-
knowledged dean, according to
the bulletin, of American med-
ical statisticians. He is head of
the division of biometry and
medical statistics of the clinic.
Dr. Berkson isn't saying that
figures don't lie, but that liars
can figure. What he points out
In his well-taken position is that
there are other cancer-causing
or encouraging substances with
which most of us come in con-
tact every day which have not
been considered in the smoking-
cancer surveys.
FOR EXAMPLE, Dr. Berkson
points _ out that_zoasted__CQtee_
beans contain the same small
the stomach, particularly among
males, has a very high inci-
dence. Yet Japanese coffee-
drinkers are few and far be-
tween.
Whats then, is the answer?
According to Dr. Berkson,
there isn't one, yet. Personally,
he says, all relevant available
facts considered, it is v e r y
doubtful that smoking causes
lung cancer.
Actually, he may have a point
there. To support it, Dr. Berk-
son quotes from a report by Dr.
E. Cuyl:er Hammond, chief sta-
tistician of' the American Can-
cer Society.
"IN MY OPINION; " Dr. Ham-
mond wrote in 1961, "the most
important finding ... is that
the over-all death rate increases
with the amount of smoking. I
want to emphasize that I said,
'over-all death rate,'' not 'lung
cancer.' The relationship be-
tween smoking and lung cancer
should be viewed in the light of
this broader picture."
The "broader picture" is the
statistical f a c t that approxi-
mately 85 per cent of the ex-
cess deaths (t h e number of
deaths beyond the normal ex-
pectancy) are from causes other
than lung cancer.
Just the same, Rep Morris
Udall, D-Ariz., and Sens. Frank
E. Moss, D-Utahl and Joseph
Clark, D-Pa., are sponsors of
legislation to give the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration t h e

ducts as it now ha!, over foods,

amounts of a carcinogenio_agent
as do cigarette papers. In addi-
tion, there are things almost a11
of us eat every day which con-
tain very tiny amounts of ar-
senic, a poison and cancer-
encouraging drug.
Coffee and cigarettes are
handmaidens to e a c h other.
which, then, if both contain car-
cinogens, asks Dr. Berkson, is
the real culprit, if any?
Consider coffee. Americans
drink it by the oceansful, yet
cancer of the stomach is a very
minor problem in this country.
In Japan, however, cancer of
The measure has the blcssing
of the American Heart Associa-
tion, and is aimed particularly
at teen-agers. Although he had.
no comment on the proposed
legislation, Dr. Berkson, a non-
smoker of cigarettes, said he
believes it would be a good
idea if young people did not
smoke. In fact, he thinks it
would be a bctter idea if no-
body smoked. Could be,
MEANWHILE, Dr. George E.
Moore, director of Roswell Park
Memorial Institute, New York
State's cancer-research-t r e a t-
ment center at Buffalo, says:
"There is no question at all
that cigarette smoking causes
cancer."
Consequently, the Histitute is
starting an antismoking re-
search program. The idea is to
see if taking a nicotine-substi
tute is pill (as is being done in
Sweden) which is harmless will
serve the s a m e purpose as
smoking a cigarette. You don't
light the pills; you swallow 'em.
Next comes Dr. Henry J.
Vandenberg of Grand Rapids,
Miah., surgeon and gynecolo-
gist, who says it's o k a y to
smoke cigarettes if you only
puff 'em~ instead of inhaling 'em.
He's been smoking that way
for 20 or 25 years, he says.
"Puff a cigarette as you would
a pipe or a cigar," Dr. Vanden-
berg advises. "It'll keep t h e
cigarette smokc o u t of your
lungs, and you won't get lung
cancer."
Choose your doctor.

'Cigarette Reaction'
Scientist Describes

The chain of reaction set off
when a cigarette is lighted and

by a scientist at the Albany.

According to Dr. Joseah T.

,)f filter tips.
The pharmacologically active
ingredient of cigarette smoke is
nicotine and the average smoker
-.me who inhales the smoke-ab-
rarbs about 90 per cent of the
nicotine.
Dr. Doyle said that inside the
M&gt;fi% nicotine causes the dis-e charge of adrenalin, thus arous•
ing the involuntary nrrvous sys-
tem whioh prepares humans for
"bght or fliRht."
The adrenalin-stimulated heart

said it begins in childhood and
does not appear related to smok-

Kissen reported, tend to bottle up

prietors, printers, and • publishers of
The Times, of Printing House Square,
E.C:4, against Penguin Books Ltd.,
publishers, of Bath Road, Harmonds-

Christopher Wood, author, of Els-

Barnamd &amp; Co. Ltd., printers, of

chapter headed ° How to stop "
written - by Dr. Wood in a book
entitled Common Sense About
Smoking, publin8ed as a" Penguin
Special ", by Penguin Books Ltd. and
printed by Hunt, Barnard &amp; Co. Ltd.
The plaintiffs, by the writ in the
action, claimed damages and an-in-
junction restraining the defendants
from further printing, circulating, or
distribution or otherwise publishi.ng
any copies of the book containing the
libel.
Mr. James Evans appeared for The
Tianes Publishing Co. Ltd. ; Mr. Brian
Neill for the defendants.
Md."$vans said that Dr. Wood
was- apparently of the opinion that
The Times had played down the re-
port of the Royal College of Physi-
ctans' and insufficient space was
devoted'~ by The Times to the question
whether smoking and lung cancer
were related. In ,pardcular be con-
sidered that a letter from two experts
replying in. the affirmative to a
reader's letter asking if the risk of
cancer diminished if people caf 40
stc,Yped smoking should' have been
pubtished.
Had the matter ended there, the
plaintiffs, without necessa.rily aycept-
ing the valid:ty of such comments,,
would not have sought to- challenge
the amhor's ordinary right of critic-
ism, but they c:ould not allow to pass
alllegations which accompanied thee
views referred to and which suggested
that, because of the revenue derived
from tobacco advertising, the plain-
tiffs had deliberately suppressed in-
formation including the letter
referre&amp; to and had modified their
own comment in connexion with the
inter-relationship of smoking and
lung cancer.
The defendants wholeheartedly
accepted that there was no founda-
tion whatsoever for any suggestion
that the selection of the editorial con-
tent of The Times was or had been

CIGARET SMOKING has always been
one of those voluntary, personal
actions which a man considers to be
his own business. But the California
Department of r ublic Health has now
decided that this h a b i t should be
brought under strict government con-
trol.
Having r e a c h e d the conclusion
(questionable in itself) that cigaret
smoking is profoundly harmful to
health, the Department seeks an im-
mediate program of anti-cigaret edu-
cation, establishment of anti-smoking
clinics, new laws raising cigaret taxes,
restrictions on vending machines, and
lebis:ation banning smoking in public
places.
As far as we know, the Depazt

ment has not yet suggested placing a
TV camera in every living room to re-
port the occupants' conduct to Big
Brother, but that wilt no doubt come
later.
The• Department's proposals are the
product of the feeling, which so many
public officials eventually get, that
government is wiser and mueh better
qualified than the individual to run the
individual's life.
We think it is all right for a De-
partment of Health to study the ef-
fects of smoking and to publish find-
ings, but it's not the function of any
government agency to try to tell peo-
ple they shouldn't or can't smoke
cigareU.
IN DEFENSE OF THE TOBACCO MEN
Has it ever occurred to you~ that the tobacco
industry might be suffering under unfair restrictions
and criticism in regard to their advertising practices?
It is a theory-not conclusively proven as yet
-that smnking too much gives you lung cancer.
It is also a theory-pretty well established, too-
that eating too much of certain types of food makes
you tco fat. And over•weight is probably the great&lt;
est single health menace today.
(~ Seems that advertisers promoting calories might
do just as much damage with their copy and
'~ pictures as the cigarette advertisers.
Y manufacturers, manufactures, and their agencies,
m go to great length to describe the power under
'Q the hood of their latest' models. Which is America's
~ greatest killer? The automobile? Cancer? Or heart
~ trouble?
0
Other killers on the American scene are over
work and worry of executives. Most of the cases
resulting from these two oppcnents to good health~
result from the competition found in business today.
What develops your competiton s business more
than a good advertising campaign?
If the cigarette advertisers are geing to be.
limited in their advertising. and considered as crim,
inals for inducing the public to buy their product,
what about the adwertisers of cake mix?
Cake is certainly fattening. Overweight causes
heart trouble. Let's restrict the advertising of cake
mix along with cigarettez. And candy. And frozen
pies.
Television commtrcials show the latest sport
models climbing mountainous roads of dirt without
guard rails, or a young couple whisking across hill
and dale without benefit of road, to illustrate the
power of that particular bomb on wheels. Should
they be allbwed to suggest that the listeners go
out and .kill themselves by using all that power?
Now comes the overwork and' worry problem.
These two executive hazards cause ulcers, which
in turn cause a lot of trouble to business" men.
Let s restrict alli advertising so my ccmpetitor
won't become first in the Milwaukee market while
my campaign takes over the St. Louis housewives.
Then, my competitor won't worry about St. Louis
and I won't fret about Milwaukee. We'li- both
save ulcers and an early death.
Why are we taking it cut on the cigarette
people? They dbn't seem to be such horrible people
after all.

Tuesday the report is based on
studies of the first four years of
a six-year survey.
"It fully confirms all we've

How so? As the Associated
Press put It, Mr. Garfinkle
"eaid he could not divulge de-
tails of the smoking and lung
cancer study. . -. ." Until de-
tails and facts are divulged,
however, this statistical ex-

clearly fall into the category of.
"emoficcal statements" which
not only *Mr. Allen's organiza-.

do without. The fact remains that there
has yet been no scientific proof
that smoking causes cancer or
heart' trouble. Unless and until..
such proof has been presented,
everyone ought to be accorded
the kind of respite Mr. Allen
suggests.
For some time, the society has
believed that the Cancer death
rate was 10 times as great among
cigarette smokers andd about 25
times as great among heavy smo-
kers.

Why do 80 million Americans con-

The answer seem.s to be psychologi-

"The tobacco habit cannot be com-

To Scare Reports
CHARLOTTE, Sept. 25 /8*--A whether tobacco affects a
report to be made to the Ameri-ler's health. .
can Medical Society later this
year reportedly "fully confirms"
suspicions that lung cancer is pro-
ed by cigarette smoking.
wrence Garfinkei, a statisti-
caC research worker for the
~American Cancer Society, said
Tuesday the report is based on
studies of the first four years of
a six-year survey.
"It fully confirms all we've
said previously about the rela-
tionship of smoking to cancer and
to heart disease," Garfinkei said
at a cancer prevention meeting
here.
In Winston-Salem, officials of
two tobacco-producing states said
persons who oppose smoking
should remain silent until re-
search establishes conclusively
11
..Y' C .
How so? As the Associated
Press put It, Mr. Garfinkle
"eaid he could not divulge de-
tails of the smoking and lung
cancer study. . -. ." Until de-
tails and facts are divulged,
however, this statistical ex-
pert's comments 'at Charlotte
clearly fall into the category of.
"emoficcal statements" which
not only *Mr. Allen's organiza-.
tion but everyone else can well
do without. The fact remains that there
has yet been no scientific proof
that smoking causes cancer or
heart' trouble. Unless and until..
such proof has been presented,
everyone ought to be accorded
the kind of respite Mr. Allen
suggests.
For some time, the society has
believed that the Cancer death
rate was 10 times as great among
cigarette smokers andd about 25
times as great among heavy smo-
kers.
However, Garfinkel, addressing

. \.President George V. Allen of
Phil Campbell, commissioner of
agriculture for •Georgia, said it is
"very difficult to get an answer
from a researcher until he has
completed his study. Even then
there are often . , . qualifying
statements."
Mancil J. Vinson, assistant com-
missioner from Kentucky, agreed
that more research is needed on
the cancer-smoking issue. T
"We've reached the point in ag- '
riculture," Vinson said, "that we
can't afford to make decisions on
anything less than facts that aree
directly based on clinical re-
search." .~
Campbell and Vinson were in
Winston-Salem for a convention

Garfinkel told the Charlotte

Tuesday the report is based on
studies of the first four years of
a six-year survey.
"It fully confirms all we've

How so? As the Associated

"eaid he could not divulge de-
tails of the smoking and lung
cancer study. . -. ." Until de-
tails and facts are divulged,
however, this statistical ex-

clearly fall into the category of.
"emoficcal statements" which
not only *Mr. Allen's organiza-.

do without. The fact remains that there
has yet been no scientific proof
that smoking causes cancer or
heart' trouble. Unless and until..
such proof has been presented,
everyone ought to be accorded
the kind of respite Mr. Allen
suggests.
For some time, the society has
believed that the Cancer death
rate was 10 times as great among
cigarette smokers andd about 25
times as great among heavy smo-

gers of heavy smoking.in later life.
_ A state=wide youth meeting was held at
Durham to air the opinions of individuals
and groups who believe smoking is a'health
hazard. :
And now most of the major cigarette
manufacturers have decided to discontinue
advertising in college newspapers, maga-
aines and football programs, it was learned
this week. .
A top official of the Tobacco lnstitute
says the manufacturers have always re-
garded smoking as an adult custom. Now,
to avoid confusion, a number of member
companies have decided to drop college ad-
vertising and other promotional activity.
One manufacturer said the mo.e was
,
intended to prevent "youngsters" from
getting the idea smoking is "grown-up and
the thing to do." In discussions of why
young people smoke, imitation of adults is
frequently given as a chief motivation.
The same manufacturer says his firm.
will not advertise cigarettes on television
programs before .9 p.m.
Madison Avenue sources report some
companies are considering self-regulation
including elimination of athletes from cig-
arette ads.
It should be obvious by now to most
thinking people that heavy cigarette smok-
ing cannot be shrugged off an as unpleasant
but harmless habit. Too much maneuvering
Is going on in high places.
Also, it has been obvious right' along that
the best time to stop smoking is before you
start. It may be true the country would be eco-
nomically crippled if the tobacco industry
went out of business overnight.
But if the process began with a genera-
tion of ' non-smokers now in elementary
school and was applied gradually to the en-
tire nation on a voluntary basis, adjust-
ments could be made to absorb those de-
pendent on the industry.
Doctors and others who have been work-
ing on this health problem should tackle it
with renewed energy after this latest little
victory.

2 DOUBT SMOKING
IS CANCER CAUSE
Tobacco Company's Survey
Challenges Statistical Link
of Cigarettes and Disease
101111 S i UDIES AR€ CITED
Ca'rp!ation Between, Urban
Living and Ir.cidence of
.
Malignancy Is Noted
By ROBERT K. PLUMB
Two socia: scientists of the
American Tobacco CompaiSy
have challenged the idea that
cigarette smoking is statistical-
ly associated with death from
lung cancer.
~In an article in the October
//ssue of Industrial Medicine and
~Surgery, they"ho.d-that-statis-
ticaT association is a faulty
method cf estaGiishing cigar-
ettes as a cause of lung cancer.
They find that among many
factors, there is a strong corre-
lation between living in a city
and contracting lung csncer.
And they attack the idea that a
heavier smoking popuiatiorl
wi?l
incur lung cvrcer at a higher
rate than a lightt-r smoking
population.
The two are Dr. Jacob Cohen,
a psychologist of New York
University, who is a consultant
to'the American Ta;;acco Com-
pwny, and Dr. Robert K. Hei-
mann, a sociologist and statis-
tician.
Four Studies Ci'ted
'"hey said that four large
studies of heavy smnki.g oopu-
lattons living In nonurban areas
.showed that males in these
areas had less lung cancer than
smoking males in urban areas
of the United States and Brit-
ain
Three of the studies were
done in South Africa, New Zea-
land and Australia. The fourth,
reported by Dr. Cohen and Dr.
Heimann a year ago, concerns
11,000 American Tobacco Com-
pany employes living in me-
dium-sized and small cities.
The tobacco employes, stud-
ied over a W,-year period,
smoked more than the average
United States smoking popula-
tion. Yet they had fewer deaths
from cancer cr heart dt.;ease
than the ger.eral public.
«
1~3~J, ~~ ._ ~.~.!) `0 -
The two emphasize that au
the studies suggest that there is
an association between cit'y liv-
ing and lung cancer. Some have
zssumed that this is due to air
pollution. ,
Urban Factor Noted
But Dr. Cohen and Dr. Hei-
mann point oUt that there are
many descriptions of the effects
of urban life including "nerv-
ous tension," "social stress,"
.,heightened metabolic activ-
Ity," "restless personality" and
"accelerated rate of living." 7
Perhaps. they said, tne estab-
lished urban factor in lung ca:i-
cei• is a catch-all term fdZ•
tendeneies related to rity living.
'fhey were critical o: some as-
pects of the smokiiig - caa7car
study conducted nearly Gett
years ago for the American
Cancer Society by Dr. Daniel
..Horn and Dr. Cuy'.er Hammond.
Nonsmokers in the sodiety
3tudy had lung cancer death
rates about the same as that
of the general popul6tion, they
said. And they questioned the
Horn-Hammond technique of
comparing the lung cancer
death rates among smokers
• with nonsmokers in the same
study group.
Neither Dr. Hammon.i nor
D Horn could be reached for
corinent.
DrCohe1 and Dr. Heimann
criticized the statisticai tech-
nique of taking a single factor
-s.ich as smoking-and asso-
ciar.ing it with a single condi-
t:ion such as lung cancer, usingg
non-smoker3 as a standard of
comparison.
ror example, they puir:t'vi cut
s*-at;stica indica.te othat F!0cit'Qs
and accid._nts are less
~among smoicrrs tha•u non-smol.-
ers. And smokers have less d:a-
betes and rheumatic heart dis-
ease.
~ This does not suggest that
tobacco use protects against
deaths from these causes, they
reported, but it does indicate
i"the absurd consequences of ac-
'cepting single-variable gradi-
ents (such as sanoking] based
on non-smoker mortality as the
'nornnal euPectatic~•': "

',~: In these days of intensified competi-
-~ tion and promotion of consumer products,
a a voluntary action by most of the prin-
:;cipal tobacco firms comes as a consid-
erablie surprise.
It is the decision to discontinue cig-
arette saless promotion in student publi-
. cations and in athletic programs on
'American university and college cam-
puses. - ..
The course of action was announced as
an accomplished fact, without prior in-
dication that it was in the making, and
without any public campaign involving
the particular question.
President George V. Allen of the To-
bacco Institute .summed up the whole
thing in one sentence:
"The tobacco industry's. position has
always been that smoking is an adult
custom."
He commented further that the de-
cision of the cigarette manufacturers
was for the purpose of emphasizing
that position, and to prevent any public
misconception that they were trying to.o
concentrate their sales appeal toward
adolescents.
The policy announcement' through the
institute, trade association composed of
nearly all the tobacco firms, made no
reference to health arguments as to cig-
arette smoking, nor to current discus-
sions as to expanding or restricting in,
dividual privileges or activities in the
nation's colleges and universities.
It carried no implication of advice to
young people.
The firms, through the Tobacco In-
stitute, have financed very extensive re-
search into health aspects of smoking
and particularly on the various types
and effectiveness of health safeguards
in the •various processes of preparing
and manufacturing cigarettes and other
tobacco products.
These reports have been made public,
along with the stream of widely vary-
ing and generally contradictory opinions
from other research organizations and
from individuals.
The new action, taken without pres-
sure from college administrators or oth-
er sources, appears to be simply an in-
tentional and considered public relations
gesture toward the Industry's consum-
er public, probably the broadest con-
sumer market for any mass product. It
is truly an implementation of the indus.-
try's declared position "that smoking is
an adult custom."

But I ask myself why doc•

NOTE - For some, tobacco smoking (or chewing or
sniffing) is a filthy habit. For others;, it is one of life's great
pleasures. To smoke or not to smoke? Only the patient him-
self can answer the question - after the doctor has laid
before him all the evidence which relates to him.

Remember it IF:

THE PUBLIS1iERS' AUXILIARY
National Editorial Association
July 13, 1963
In our opinion
;:Putting up a smoke screen-
to keep smoke from young
NOT SINCE LeRoy Collins, president of the
National Assn. of Broadcasters, impu-
dently suggested to members of that august
body that they bring under purview of the
NAB code of good practices all cigarette
commercials, has there been a more striking
display of "self-honesty"' than in recent ac-
tion taken by cigarette companies. -
Almost all cigarette manufacturers have
decided to drop all advertising from college
newspapers, magazines and football, pro-
grams.
According to source&amp; in the tobacco in-
dustry, about 40 to 50 percent of all national
= advertising expenditures to college media can
be attributed to cigarette advertising.
IN HIS historic suggestions at an NAB con-
ference in Portland in 1962, LeRoy Collins
frowned particularly on television advertis-
ing that appeared to be aimed at encouraging
young people to smoke. He added that' broad-
casters could no longer afford to Ignore
mounting evidence that tobacco provides "a
aerious' hazard to health." The Tobacco Insti-
tute, however, in confirming the withdrawal
from college publications of almost all major
brand cigarette advertising denied that health
was a factor in the decision. John H. Devlin,
president of Rothmans of Pall Mall, said the
move was meant to keep youngsters "from
getting the idea that smoking is grownup and
the thing to do."
It is difficult to aay what will' happen to'
the nation's college press when it is stripped
of about half of its national ad revenue. Last
year when a weekly college paper,in New
York, Main Events at the City College of New
York, decided' on its own to reject all ciga-
i•ette advertising it lost about 75 percent' of
its ad income. and continued publication only
through contributions from student.;.
FURTHER, the use of male athletes in ciga-
rette advertising has been rumored at an end.
It has long been the contention of those
critics of cigarette ads, that use of name
sportsmen tends to encourage smoking in
young sports fans. Needless to say, this step
would immediately cut the earning$ of sports
stars who now earn thousands through posing
for endorsement ads.
The uncertainty of It alt is what aim the
major tobacco companies will take in form-
ing new ad campaigns. A revolutionary turn-
about 'in advertising by cigarette manufac-
turers could trim monstrous amounts of
revenue from all the ad media.
From the time snuff signs adorned barns
throughout rural America, tobacco has been
among the most consistently and aggressively
advertised products. No one can forget the
close association that existed during the
thirties and forties between the "big bands"
and cigarette companies. Benny Goodman
and the Camel Caravan, the Lucky Strike Hit
Parade, and Kay Kyser's Kollege of Musical
Knowledge (Lucky Strike), Chesterfield's
Glenn Miller program, numerous others,
formed a strong alliance between music,
dancing and smoking. Yet, somehow, despite
the big band craze among the nation's young
people, no one ever thought that sponsorship
by a cigarette company of the country's fa-
vorite bandleader encouraged kids to smoke.
Perhaps in those days there was too much
discouragement of smoking at home. Nor
were the rather childish premiums found in
packages of cigarettes during the period-
pictures of airplanes and baseball, players-
considered as a dangerous invitation to chil-
dren to smoke.
It will be most interesting to, note the re-
sults of the withdrawal of cigarette advertis-
ing.from the coliige, press. Should smoking
decrease among college students, it will be
striking proof that the ads have been paying
off. Should smoking continue it can be readily
assumed that the students are reading other
newspapers than the campus variety.

To date the principal source of this septic fright 'f
talk about lung cancer has- been Eng- '
land, where socialized medicine has re-
duced the once haughty practitioners
of Harley street to a confraternity of

cretin babbling about lung cancer isn't going to cost
you and me money. Tobacco taxes last year yielded
$3.2 billions in State and Fed'erall revenue, and an
y
least dime's abatement in this sum is going to be
compensated by some other confiscatory rooking of
the taxpayer to support the nest of boodling elected
mendicants in Washington, D. C.


N THE YEARS of my youth, a period approxi
". mating Appomattox Court House, as it now
''seems. or at least ante-dating the Custer massacre,
cigarettes were not a highly regarded article of com-
merce. • Their use generally was restricted to the

.!.lower orders of society, pimps, race track touts,

Congressmen and the like, and certainly
none were ever smoked in my father's
,
house byy any member of the famil~.
although now and then guests asked if .
,they might be excused to go into the
. garden and smoke a cigar after
dinner.

Smoking in tht*e preser:cq of ladies
was unthinkabLe and t:.ere «-as st.iili &lt;&lt;
statute on the local' Boston law books
against smoking pipes on the public
street. pipes being associated with the Irish and not
to be tolerated in the presence of gentlefolk.
. There were, to be sure, exceptions to the rule.
'My friend Edwin Arlington, Robinson, was notori-
ously a smoker of Sweet Caporals, but he was a rec-
ognized and widely acclaimed poet and was accorded
the tolerance usually extended to genius. A bleak
and craggy Down Easter, he had been a mighty skir-
misher with the bottle in earlier times and cigarettes
were regarded as a sort of tapering off. Most other
men of letters of the time smoked pipes, and~ cigars
were, of course, the universal hallmark of manhood
and symbol of prestige according to their quality

and cost.

~t *
NOR WAS THIS PREJUDICE against cigarettes
a parochial one confined to Puritan New Eng-
land. As evidence of bad morale among the ship's
_. company in the sinking of the Titanic, witnesses
attested that in the lifeboats many stewards and
other members ot the crew lit cigarettes in the pres-
- ence of ladies, not to mention the Grim Reaper and
the greatest catastrophe of modern times. It was,
incidentally, the most serious evidence of miscon-
duct ever made against the company's servants on
that ill-starred vessel.
Tobacco in those days wasn't especially big busi-
ness, certainly nothing io attract the hostility of a
predatory Federal Guvernment bent on taxing out
of existence every possible source of revenue except
the billion dollar union racket, some of %i7fiose com«
ponents are wealthier by far than the industries
they seek to impoverish by extortion.
Now the wowsers, do-gooders and reforming
trash generally, including "medical authorities" from
mail order schools of osteopathy with nothing better
to occupy their childish minds, are grinding out a
sustained barrage of anti,cigarette propaganda. The
Surgeon General of the U. S., presumably a handy
fellow in the realm of gunshot wounds, has appointed
the usual committee to investigate the potentialities

WTNSTON-SALEM SENT?1NEL
Winston-Salem, N.C.
September 23, 1963
~ M~ie' Study
J.
Of Smoking
Is Asked
George V: Allen, president of
The Tobacco Institute, Inc., today
•• called' for a "respite from theo•
ries, resolutions and emotional
statements" about' smoking and
3tealth so long as the "theories re•
garding possible causes of lung
cancer and heart disease are in,
OD dispute among scientists.
"Perhaps then the scientists can
~ determine the areas of research
~ that must be undertaken and work
~ together to solve these health prob-
!t~ 1ems," Allen said in a speech to
the NationaLL Association of State
Departments of Agriculture here.
~ About 50 department heads had
~ registered for the conference this
O morning.
\ "Unless this happens," Allen
said, "there is some danger of los-
ing sight of what ought to be the
basic objective of all concerned.
... to expedite the research still
• necessary to find out what actual-
ly causes the diseases in question,
and what role, if any, tobacco may
play. "
. "Sheer Repetition
Allen said that "by sheer repeti-
tion," critics of smoking "are now
seeking to give the impression of
'mounting evidence' that' smoking
is responsible for various health
problems, even though the causes
of these problems remain in dis-
pute among scientists.
"Actually, while there have been
many resolutions and repeated
stories and articles about smoking
and health in the recent past;, the
scientific situation remains large-
ly as it was."
Allen saiu that "the litera.,,re
on tobacco and health contains
such a wide variety of fiction and'
non-fiction, fact and opinion, that
it is difficult, at best, to determine
what the facts rea'lly are.
"However, when one considers"
all of the available research, one
finds that much of it does not fit
the theory as presented by those
who regard smoking as a serious
health hazard.
"It is natural that the headlines
usually go to those who suggest a
possible answer to health prob-
lems, or who present a new theory
or who make a charge.
"However, 'a chorus of loud
voices saying that tobacco is
'guilty' is no substitute for re-
search.
"The position of the tobacco in-
-.'ustry; on the other hand, doess
not generally make much news,"
he said, because "we do not' pre-
sume to know the answers. ...
Certain Things
"There are certa:n things we
do know," Allen said:
"We do know that the theories
regarding possible causes of lung
cancer and heart disease are in
dispute among scientists.
"We do know that' the originat
theory about smoking and lung
cancer - the theory that smoke
was a'direct„ contact carcinogen-
has virtually been abandoned;
"We do know that in labora-
tories arotmd' the world scientists
are investigating many possible
factors in lung cancer and heart
disease, in addition to smoking."
Allen n o t e d that the "case
against smoking still rests largely
on statistical studies, whose mean-
ings are questicned by many lead-
ing medical statisticians."
He also said that "intensive
clinical znd laboratory research
has failed to provide the verifica-
tion necessary to show a cause

Of Smoking
Is Asked
George V: Allen, president of
The Tobacco Institute, Inc., today
•• called' for a "respite from theo•
ries, resolutions and emotional
statements" about' smoking and
3tealth so long as the "theories re•
garding possible causes of lung
cancer and heart disease are in,
OD dispute among scientists.
"Perhaps then the scientists can
~ determine the areas of research
~ that must be undertaken and work
~ together to solve these health prob-
!t~ 1ems," Allen said in a speech to
the NationaLL Association of State
Departments of Agriculture here.
~ About 50 department heads had
~ registered for the conference this
O morning.
\ "Unless this happens," Allen
said, "there is some danger of los-
ing sight of what ought to be the
basic objective of all concerned.
... to expedite the research still
• necessary to find out what actual-
ly causes the diseases in question,
and what role, if any, tobacco may
play. "
. "Sheer Repetition
Allen said that "by sheer repeti-
tion," critics of smoking "are now
seeking to give the impression of
'mounting evidence' that' smoking
is responsible for various health
problems, even though the causes
of these problems remain in dis-
pute among scientists.
"Actually, while there have been
many resolutions and repeated
stories and articles about smoking
and health in the recent past;, the
scientific situation remains large-
ly as it was."
Allen saiu that "the litera.,,re
on tobacco and health contains
such a wide variety of fiction and'
non-fiction, fact and opinion, that
it is difficult, at best, to determine
what the facts rea'lly are.
"However, when one considers"
all of the available research, one
finds that much of it does not fit
the theory as presented by those
who regard smoking as a serious
health hazard.
"It is natural that the headlines
usually go to those who suggest a
possible answer to health prob-
lems, or who present a new theory
or who make a charge.
"However, 'a chorus of loud
voices saying that tobacco is
'guilty' is no substitute for re-
search.
"The position of the tobacco in-
-.'ustry; on the other hand, doess
not generally make much news,"
he said, because "we do not' pre-
sume to know the answers. ...
Certain Things
"There are certa:n things we
do know," Allen said:
"We do know that the theories
regarding possible causes of lung
cancer and heart disease are in
dispute among scientists.
"We do know that' the originat
theory about smoking and lung
cancer - the theory that smoke
was a'direct„ contact carcinogen-
has virtually been abandoned;
"We do know that in labora-
tories arotmd' the world scientists
are investigating many possible
factors in lung cancer and heart
disease, in addition to smoking."
Allen n o t e d that the "case
against smoking still rests largely
on statistical studies, whose mean-
ings are questicned by many lead-
ing medical statisticians."
He also said that "intensive
clinical znd laboratory research
has failed to provide the verifica-
tion necessary to show a cause
and effect role for smoking."
Allen is a former dire;tor of the

Survey Finds L.A.
Smog No Factor
in Mortality Rise
BY HARRY NELSON
Times Medical Editor
Ttso Loma Linda Univer-
rity physicians Wednesdacd blamed cigarette smokiiig
rather than Los Angeles
smog for an increase in
rnortaIity from a luiig
disease, emphysema.
Their conclusion is based
on a fiYe-year comparison of
d e a t h s from emphysema
among 63,000 California Sev-
enth-day Adventists and the
general population. Adven-
tists do not smoke.
"If air pollution of the Los
Angeles variety is a factor in
puhnonary emphysema, it
has not yet become apparent
In death statistics," declared
Drs: Frank R. Lemon and
Richard T T. 1VaIden. .
Increased Six-fold
Their reruarks appear ih
an article in the current
issue of "The Review and
Herald," an Adventist publi-
catiorr.
The authoiis pointed out
that the incidence of em
physema increased siY-fold
between 1950 and 1960. The
disease is characterized by a
lo," of elasticity of lung
tissues which makes it diffi-
cult for the individual to
exhale.
The physician found that
whereas 22 Adv.entists would

Can "Smoking Doubts Be Reso
•
C IGARETTE SMOKING has never
been found guilty in a final,
competent court of 'being a
health hazard. On the other hand,,
it hasn't' been acquitted, either. The
verdict is not in.
Meanwhile, a great deal of evidence
that presumably will be weighed be-
fore a verdict is returned' has been
piling up. It is not conclusive. Still,
it is impressive enough to have per-
suaded a number of individuals and
organizations to issue w a r n i n g s
against cigarette smoking.
The list of such actions in the
decade or so since the lung cancer
scare began is very long, and it keeps
growing. Just a few days ago the
American Heart Association decided
to campaign against cigarettes, with
special emphasis on teen-agers. A
couple of months ago a new medical
publication sponsored jointly by the
American Public Health Association,
*Amcrican Heart Association, Amer-
ican Cancer Association, and the Na-
tional Tuberculosis Association issued
figures indicating higher mortality
rates among cigarette smokers than
among others. In one smalI but not
insignificant case, a hospital in Fitch-
burg, Mass., acting on the recom-
mendation of its medical staff, banned
the sale of cigarettes in the hospital,
and the nurses' home.
Discordant Cousins
All this time the tobacco Industry
has taken an understandably;, defen-
sive position. It set up, several years
ago, the Tobacco Industry Research
Committee to try to arrive at the
truth, if any, behind all the charges
and suspicions. Thus far it has been
able to say little more than that the
charges have not been proved (which
is true)l and occasionally quote a sci~
entist or medical man who says that
other factors than cigarette smoking
may be involved in the various
diseases now frequently linked to,
smoking.
But even though on the defensive,
the tobacco industry has not retreated
-that is, not until the other day
when it began what can only be
interpreted as strategic withdrawal on
one segment of the front. Most' of
the major cigarette manufacturers de-
cided to stop advertising and pro-
motion on college campuses.
Nothing was said, naturally, to hint
that this was any concession by the
industry that its products might in
fact be harmful. Rather, a spokesman
said, "The industry's position has al-
ways been that smoking is an adult
custom:" Nevertheless, this with-
drawal from~ colllege campuses, where
the various cigarette brands fought
some of their most vigorous wars
for many years, is bound to. cause
the public to wonder.
Of' course, the public has been
wondering for some time. Its reluc-
tant suspicions h a v e resulted in a
revolution in the cigarette industry,
the rise of the filter tips,,. which
may or mayy not diminish those ele-
ments in cigarettes that may or may
not be harmful. (And if that sentence
is confusing, it is at least in part
because . the situation itself is con-
fusing.)
Moreover, the public has not aI-
lowed its suspicionb to interfere sub-
stantially with its smoking. There has
been~ some redhetion in the annual
rate of increase in consumption, but
not much.
What is needed is obvious: a
definite• and authoritative statement
on the truth or falsity of the charges
against cigarette smoking. Perhaps
that' need cannot be met now. Maybe
nobody knows enough to be able to
make such a statement. Our best hope
lies in a study the U. S. Public Health
Service undertook about a year ago,
but no report has been issucd. When
it is, maybe it will' resolve these
doubts one way or another.

Six cigaret companies have 'just issued a statement
that says, in part, •" . . . it is not the intent of the industry'
to promote and encourage smoking among youths." Al-
most all manufacturers have decided to drop.advertising
from college newspapers, magazines and football pro-
grams and Canadian tobacco manufacturers announced
they would not run cigaret commercials on radio or tele-
vision before 9 p. m. All this is described by The Pub-
.lishers' Auxiliary, a newspapermans newspaper, as "a
atriking display of self-honesty".
The editor of The News, a smoker himself, cannot
agree with this fatuous claim of the Publishers' Auxiliary,
for it seems evidenthat tobacco companies are only bend-
Ing before building mass of evidence that cigaret smok-
ing is. harmful to health. Any confirmed fag puffer can
". -' `tell you that cigarets aren't good for you and in recent
years research has indicated that cigarets are a factor in
lung cancer and heart disease.

In the face of this, until very recently the tobacco
companies have aimed their advertising at young people,
using athletes, "hot rodders", near juvenile sophisticates
and the like to peddle their wares. They have, with a
great measure of success, sought to fasten the habit on
young people from the days of radio programs featuring
Ray Kayser, Benny Goodman and Glenn, Miller to the
:present sorry spectacle of athletes sucking joyfully on a
butt for the edification of television viewers.
Tobacco companies have been attempting to sell new
generations on the habit of smoking and any statement
to the contrary is ridiculous. They have done so with-
out appeal to moderation and with massive resistance to
any claims that cigarets may be harmful. Their present
apparent switch away from youth is nothing more bending
than to mounting evidence that smoking is a threat to
health.

DEG`ISION OF THE MAJOR cigarette
manufacturing companies to withdraw
. advertisements from college publications
and cease promotion activities on the
campuses, is a limited, but significant
start toward voluntary reform in tobacco
sales programs. .
: In the face of increasing public pres-

aure, six of the largest cigarette compa-
nies decided to desist from persuading

college youngsters to take up smoking. In
reaching this decision Tobacco Institute
officials pointed out the anomalous posi-
tion in which • the manufacturers find
themselves by not wanting to be'seen bid-
; ding for the younger, patronage.
They evidently want this new busi!-
ness but cannot afford to further offend
the public taste by making obvious over-
lures to young people. Between 2% and
..370 of the Industry's annual sales
growth comes from young adults and that
apparently satisfies the manufacturers.
This welcome reform probably got its
start last autumn when LeRoy Collins,
president of the National Assn. of Broad-
casters, stirred up a not controversy
among his associates with his suggestion
*that the code be revised to curb cigarette
advertising designed to appeal especially
to young people. He also criticized se-
verely sports heroes who permit their
hero status "to be prostituted" i'n tobacco

advertising.
Cigarette advertisers need some com-
mon guidelines, or a focal point from .
wwhich they can shape new policies. They
are highly competitive and therefore hesi-
tant about sitting down and talking over
their problems.
If they are actually looking for a code,,
the British tobacco advertisers have a
good one they could adopt. The Independ-
ent Television Authority en joins themm
from five ob jectionable types of advertis-
ing material:
0 Advertisements that greatly over-
emphasize the pleasure to be derived from •
smoking cigarettes. .
. . *Advertising that features the con-
ventional heroes of youth..
• *Advertisi'ng that appeals to pride,
social prestige, or manliness.
• 0 Advertisements using a fashionable
social setting to support the impression
that cigarette smoking is a "go-ahead"
habit, or an essential part of the pleas-
ures and excitement of modern living.
9 Advertising that strikingly presents
romantic situations geared to exaggerat-
ing the pleasure of smoking. .
THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY'S decision to
withdraw advertising and promotions
geared especially to teen-agers shows at
least in this case, good judgment.

A constructive suggestion from
George V. Allen, president of the To-
bacco Institute, proposes that cig-
arette advertising be aimed at adults
rather than young people.
"In keeping with the position of the
industry that smoking is a custom for
adults, cigarette- advertising should
not give a contrary impression," Al-
len said in a statement at Washing-
ton. He suggested that persons fea-
tured- in such advertising be, and ap-
pear to be, adults.
Earlier, tobacco manufacturers had
joined in abandoning advertising in
collegiate publications, a step in the
direction Allen suggests.
Another proposal offered by Mr. Al-
len would shift similarly the direction
of radio and television advertising
from youngsters, something he re-
gards, preferable to "arbitrary re-
striction of sponsorship to certain
hours of the listening or viewing
day." This would appear to take note
of-in a purpose of averting in this
country=Canadian tobacco manufac-
turers voluntarily announcing last
month they would run no cigarette
commercials on radio or television be-
fore 9 p.m.
An industry spending almost a quar-
ter of a billion dollars for advertis-
ing is engaged in the toughest fight
for survival that industry has yet
faced. The tobacco manufacturers
recognize clearly the problem they
face and would appear to be adjust-
ing by facing up to responsibilities
and challenge of public health.

'Why do 80 million American

By RUTH WINTER
Why do 80 million Americans con-
tinue to smoke despite dire warnings
issued almost daily that they are puff-
ing their way to lung car.cer, heart
disease and other fatal maladies?'
The answer seem.s to be psychologi-
cal rather than a physical' addiction.
"The tobacco habit cannot be com-
pared with the use of such drugs as
morphine, cocaine, or - alcohol, for it
is not taken for the purpose of produc-
ing stimulation or depression of the
central nervous system, and It seems
doubtful whether the nicotU,e ordinar-

A Constructive Step
Most of the major cigaret companies have decided to
stop advertistng, ih college publications. George V. Allen,
president of the Tobacco Institute, said "the industry's posi-
tion has always been that smoking is an adult custom" and
that this ad-cancellation step had been taken "to avoid any
confusion or misconception in the public mind as to this:
position."
In so doing, the Industry is conceding nothing to the
"health" charges, but is acting to disarm its critics of a peri-
pherai weapon. Since it's a painfull step for any manu-
facturer to shrink his market' even to a small degree, the
fact that it's bein done voluntarily deserves credit.

MIiHICA iS ONE of the relatively feww countries left in
• A this world where children do not smoke-at least not
publicly. About 15 years ago, someone in the tobacco industryy
seriously considered launching an advertising campaign aimed
at youngsters of grade school age. This hare-brained idea of
some advertising genius, who may have been smoking the
wrong stuff, was wisely rejected by the more mature tobacco
people.
And now the industry has made another decision, of which .
we voice our wholehearted approval. The Tobacco institute
has revealed that most cigaret manufacturers have decided
to stop advertising in college newspapers and magazines, and
on sports programs. It is also reported in advertising circles
that several tobacco companies are considering eliminating
athletes from cigaret ads.
"The industry's position has always been • that smoking
is an adult custom," said George V. Allen, president of th~
Tobacco iastitute. We agree with him, and commend
industry on its latest move.

College Papers Doubt Tobacco Ad
cutoff Would Halt Teen Smoking
OKLAHOMA C I T Y tUP1)-
Three of Oklahoma's leading col-
lege newspapers feel that the de-
cision of the Tobacco Institute to
halt all advertising in college pub-
lications will not affect teen
smoking habits in any way-ex-
cept possibly in the brand chosen.
The schools and papers polled
were the University of Okla-
homa's Oklahoma Daily, Okla-
homa State University's Daily
O'Collegian, and Central' State
College's The Vista.
The Oklahoma Daily reported,
"The Tobacco Institute evidently
took this action in the face of
mounting public pressure to step
up efforts against teen smoking."
Cuts Into Revenue The most noticeable effectL the
three papers said, will be in the
revenue cuts they will suffer. The
Daily estimated an annual Ios- ef
.$6,000; the O'Collegian, b7-10,000,,
and the Vista, $2-3,000. The Vista,
said the figure was about' 50 pcr
cent of its national advertisino:
revenue.
The prevailing opinion was thatt
cigarette ads have not influenced
nonsmokers to start . . . nor will
the absence of cigarette ads in-
fluence students to stop.
J. M. Poynor. advertising anc
business manager of .0U student
publications, said he dbes not be-
lieve elimination of cigarette ad-
vertising will alleviate the situa
tion. He said that many students ,
smoked before entering college. '
He suggested that if all cigarette i
advertising were eliminated, the
problem might be solved.
Would Like to Know
Betty Jones,' summer editor of
the Daily, asked all students who
quit smoking because her paper
quit advertising cigarettes to
."drop us a line."
Both Miss Jones and Herschel
Randolph{ summer editor of the
O'Collegian, said that some ad-
vertising is interesting in itself.
They both cited a weekly column
written by humorist Max Schul-
man and distributed by a cigar-
ette company as being a part of
college life..
EditoriaJly, the O'Colle
glan said, "it is an unrealistic
move because of the. other con:
tacts students h a v e with cig-
iarettes."
All three publications expressed
belief thate the institute would re-
veme the policy within a couple
of years. But until the reversal
comes, none of them knew how
they would fill the gap left by
the accounts.
Miss Jones did present one an-
swer to part of the problem. She
said, "maybe Schulman can make
a contract with an~ aspirin com-
pany pany or somebody so he can keep
writing his columns."

' The tobacco industry Is under fire

' The postmaster general is the latest
to land with all fours on the embattled

it will withdraw its cigaret advertising
from college newspapers, which have
practically lived on that source of rev-

Yet' the consumption of cigarets con-

were 496 billion, a record, and the use
of cigarets has increased 34 per cent
In the last decade. -
Only the rate of increase, not the
Increase itself, is beginning to taper off
and this is the sole evidence to date
that the public is taking to heart the
warnings of hazards ahead. The prin-

are in the future, not the present.
It may be said we're smoking more

'No Smoking, Kids'
Most major cigarette manufacturers
have decided to stop advertising in col-

said this week: "The industry's position .has always
been that smoking is an adult custom.
To avoid any confusion or misconcep'-
tion In the public mind as to this posi-
tion, a number of member companies
of the Tobacco Institute. I understand,
have each decided to discontinue college„
advertising and promotional activities."
Canadian tobacco manufacturers an-
nounced that they had decided to restrict
cigarette commercial television and radio
to the hours after 9 p.m. ' This, too, Is
to "keep youngsters from getting the
Idea that smoking is grownup and the
thing to do " a spokesman said.
The American Medical Association
decided this week against committing
Itself to any position on smoking. It did
approve a committee suggestion that
the association begin a campaign to
educate high school students on the
effects of toxic materials, including
tobacco, on young persons.
: Ironically, the tobacco Industry, by
taking positive action, seems more con-
vinced than the doctors that smoking Is

published quarterly under the auspices of Graduate School of Journalism, Colimia
; University.,.The publication's stated purpose is, "...to assess the performance of
Journalism in all its forms." • "
This staff prepared article reviews the coverage of news events involving tobacco and
health since the 1938 publication of Dr. Raymond E. Pearl's statistical study of
longevity among amokers However, the bulk of the analysis covers the period from 195~+ yp~

=The editors`conclude "...the news and informationmedia of the United States have treated
th6 smoking and healthiasue in ways ranging from courageous and outspoken to indifferent
and timid."

K
'They say coverage haa been sufficiently fragment'ed by publicity efforts on both sides
! to cause confusion. However, they state "Suppression of news of the controversy for

^s~ secandary to other factors." • '

In commentingn the coverage of specific media, the article says that magazines of fact
have presented the most thorough coverage and note this category includes, "...an unusual
example of over-coverage -- the propaganda campaiga by the Reader's Digest." 4:
: The Review says newspaper coverage has been satisfactory but confusing and suggests ~
documentary articles and editorials should be used to clarify confusion.

The Review says broadcast news coverage has been "equivalent in character

,..In an explanatory statement the editors of the Review say that the material for the
,`'article was compiled by Arthur E. Rowse, an assistant city editor of the Washington Post,
but that Mr. Rowse refused use of his byline because of revisions in his manuscript.
The editors state "For its part, the Review (1) does not believe its function is to

take a strong position against cigaret

A Constructive Step
Most of the major cigaret companies have decided to
stop advertistng, ih college publications. George V. Allen,
president of the Tobacco Institute, said "the industry's posi-
tion has always been that smoking is an adult custom" and
that this ad-cancellation step had been taken "to avoid any
confusion or misconception in the public mind as to this:
position."
In so doing, the Industry is conceding nothing to the
"health" charges, but is acting to disarm its critics of a peri-
pherai weapon. Since it's a painfull step for any manu-
facturer to shrink his market' even to a small degree, the
fact that it's bein done voluntarily deserves credit.

MIiHICA iS ONE of the relatively feww countries left in
• A this world where children do not smoke-at least not
publicly. About 15 years ago, someone in the tobacco industryy
seriously considered launching an advertising campaign aimed
at youngsters of grade school age. This hare-brained idea of
some advertising genius, who may have been smoking the
wrong stuff, was wisely rejected by the more mature tobacco
people.
And now the industry has made another decision, of which .
we voice our wholehearted approval. The Tobacco institute
has revealed that most cigaret manufacturers have decided
to stop advertising in college newspapers and magazines, and
on sports programs. It is also reported in advertising circles
that several tobacco companies are considering eliminating
athletes from cigaret ads.
"The industry's position has always been • that smoking
is an adult custom," said George V. Allen, president of th~
Tobacco iastitute. We agree with him, and commend
industry on its latest move.

Living and Ir.cidence of Malignancy Is Noted
By ROBERT R. PLUMB
Two socia: scientists of the
American Tobacco CompaiSy
have challenged the idea that
cigarette smoking is statistical-
ly associated with death from
lung cancer.
In an article in the October
/~sue of Industrial Medicine and
urgery, they"ho.d-that-statis-
ticaT association is a faulty
method ef estaGiishing cigar-
ettes as a cause of lung cancer.
They find that among many
factors, there is a strong corre-
lation between living in a city
and contracting lung cancer.
And they attack the idea that a
heavier smoking popuiatior. wi?l
incur lung cvrcer at a higher
rate than a lightt-r smoking
population.
The two are Dr. Jacob Cohen,
a psychologist of New York
University, who is a consultant
to'the American Ta;;acco Com-
pwny, and Dr. Robert K. Hei-
mann, a sociologist and statis-
tician.
Four Studies Cited'"hey said that four large
studies of heavy smnki.g oopu-
lattons living In nonurban areas
.showed that males in these
areas had less lung cancer than
smoking males in urban areas
of the United States and Brit-
ain
Three of the studies were
done in South Africa, New Zea-
land and Australia. The fourth,
reported by Dr. Cohen and Dr.
Heimann a year ago, concerns
11,000 American Tobacco Com-
pany employes living in me-
dium-sized and small cities.
The tobacco employes, stud-
ied over a W,-year period,
smoked more than the average
United States smoking popula-
tion. Yet they had fewer deaths
from cancer rr heart dt.;ease
than the ger.eral public.
'_c.t~-.J~ «~~
~~'uJ,aJ 70 -
The two emphasize that au
the studies suggest that there is
an association between cit'y liv-
ing and lung cancer. Some have
zssumed that this is due to air
pollution.
Urban Factor Noted
But Dr. Cohen and Dr. Hei-
mann point oUt that there are
many descriptions of the effects
of urban life including "nerv-
ous tension," "social stress,"
.,heightened metabolic activ-
Ity," "restless personality" and
"accelerated rate of living." 7
Perhaps. they said, tne estab-
lished urban factor in lung ca:i-
cer is a catch-all term fdZ•
tendeneies related to rity living.
They were critical of some as-
pects of the smokiiig - caa7c:er
study conducted nearly Gett
years ago for the American
Cancer Society by Dr. Daniel
..Horn and Dr. Cuy'.er Hammond.
Nonsmokers in the sodiety
3tudy had lung cancer death
rates about the same as that
of the general popul6tion, they
said. And they questioned the
Horn-Hammond technique of
comparing the lung cancer
death rates among smokers
• with nonsmokers in the sarhe
study group.
Neither Dr. Hammon.i nor
Dr. Horn could be reached for
corinent.
DrCohe1 and Dr. Heimann
criticized the statisticai tech-
nique of taking a single factor
-s.ich as smoking-and asso-
ciar.ing it with a single condi-
t:ion such as lung cancer, using
non-smoker3 as a standard of
comparison.
ror example, they puir:tvi cut
s*-at;stica indica.te that F!.0cit'9s
and accid._nts are less
among smoicrrs thau non-smol.-
ers. And smokers have less d:a-
betes and rheumatic heart dis-
ease.
I This does not suggest that
tobacco use protects against
deaths from these causes, they
reported, but it does indicate
i"the absurd consequences of ac-
'cepting single-variable gradi-
ents (such as sanoking] based
on non-smoker mortality as the
'nornnal euPectat-c~•': "

VEN Madison Avenue's hard-
E bitten professionals were jolted
earlier this summer when the
cigarette industry suddenly announced
a series of voluntary restrictions on its
advertising. Henceforth, the industry
said, there would be no more display
advertising in college newspapers, or
on radio and TV shows aimed mainly
at teen-agers. Youthful-looking models
and athletic heroes would disappear
from cigarette ads and industry spokes-
men proclaimed' a new era of "good
judgment and good taste."
' The impact of this sudden display
9
of virtue was felt in many sectors. Col-
lege newspapers reeled' at the prospect
of losing half their advertising revenue.
Advertising agency executives, whose
cigarette campaigns increasingly have
focused on the youth market, convened
emergency evening meetings to im-
provise new strategy. The hint by some
companies that they intended to re-
nounce the whole "virility approach"
to cigarette advertising sent many
agency men scurrying for the tran-
quilizer bottle.
Meanwhile, many consumers asked
an obvious question; Why did they do
it? Why did the cigarette companies,
who have traditionally displayed little
sensitivity to the taunts of their critics,
suddenly invoke these voluntary curbs?
The main answer, it would seem, was
simply that the industry was (and is)
graveiy worried~ "Criticism, even from
stMkholders and directors, has been
mounting steadily," one cigarette com-
pany president confided. "And much of
the criticism concentrated on the
charge that our ads made too blatant
a pitch to the youngsters:'
In view of this rising tide of criticism,
industry leaders were concerned lest
they be confronted with a restrictive
code similar to those imposed in~ Britain
and Canada. In Britain not only is
cigarette advertising barred on TV
prior to 9 P.M.
but the government
,
is pondering the idea of starting an
advertising campaign on TV aimed at
discouraging smoking.
Civen this crisis,, the Tobacco Insti-
tute; a trade group, called a series of
meetings in Washington to discuss pos-
sible action. Some tobacco executives
proposed voluntary curbs, while others
opposed them on the grounds that they
Tobacco TroubG'es
would be interpreted as an admission
that cigarettes were indeed a health
hazard..
After heate&amp; debate, the former
group prevailed and the curbs were
announced. In issuing its announce-
ments, the Institute, mindful of anti-
trust laws, emphasized that it could
only "suggest" action but could issue
no industry-wide restrictions.
The voluntary curbs were neatly
tailored to gain maximum public rela-
tions impact at minimum sacrifice. In
giving up college media, for example,
the companies were sustaining no great
loss since they can easily reach college-
age youngsters through other media-
television, general magazines, etc.
Moreover, there has been a growing
trend among colleges to take the in-
itiative in banning cigarette ads from
student media.
Similarly, im restricting their youth
approach, the cigarette companies left
themselves plenty of latitude. Instead
of a specific ban on sponsorship of pro-
grams before 9 P.M., the curbs simply
state that companies should not spon-
sor shows directed mainly at youngsters.
The definition of what constitutes a
children's program, of' course, will be
left to the companies. Baseball and
football games, which are followed
with rapt attention by teen-agers, will
definitely not fall under the industry's
definition of a children's program.
Though it is easy to view the indus-
try's action with cynicism, the fact re-
mains that some industry leaders, such~
as Morgan J. Cramer of P. Lorillard
and Bowman Gray of R'. J. Reynolds,
appear to be sincere in their desire to
tone down their ads. Indeed, the in-
dustry can rightly point out that cigar-
ette advertising has improved markedly
in recent years.
It was not too long ago, after all,
that cigarette companies actually ad-
vertised their products as a health aid.
Ads carried such headlines as "Reach
for a Lucky instead of a sweet" or
"Not a cough in a carload of Old
Colds" or, the inevitable, "More doc-
tors smoke Camels than any other
cigarette."
In recent years the industry has
backed off from these strident slogans,
and indeed cigarette commercials have



become the ultimate in subtle advertis-
ing. The emphasis on virile-looking men -'`
or on healthy-outdoor settings has been
intended subtly to associate cigarettes .:
with vigor and social acceptance. No '
one cam blame a company for seeking
to place its product in this sort of de-
sirable context. ;f
,
N
th
l
o one,
at is,, un
ess that product
is proven beyond reasonable doubt to
be a health hazard. And it is in this
area that the cigarette industry con=
fronts its biggest challenge. In the fall,
a speciali advisory committee set up by
the Surgeon General is expected to re-
lease a study of the medical evidence
linking smoking with lung cancer and
heart disease.
Meanwhile several other, studies are
taking some sLrp pokes at, the industry.
Legislation has been introduced in Con-
gress to label tobacco as a"drug" and
authorize the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration to prohibit interstate shipments
unless they are labeled to disclose
hazards. And' several books are in
preparation, one sponsored by Senator
Maurine Neuberger that will list the
hazards of smoking.
One newly issued book, the Con-
sumers Union Report on Smoking and
the Public Interest (the Consumers
Union, $3.50), summarizes medical
evidence which, its authors say, is
"surely sufficient to persuade rational
men and women that they should be
better off not smoking."
It' is impossible to predict what in-
fluence, if' any, all this may have on the
nation's 63,000,000 cigarette smokers
who are willing each year to spend
nearly $7 billion for the privilege.
Though cigarette consumption declined
in 1953 and 1954 following reports of
a link between cigarettes and lung
cancer, the industry rebounded sharply
in following years:
Some experts now claim to see signs
of another slowdown. In 1962 per capi-
ta cigarette consumption fell slightly
for the first time since the 1953-54
scare. The Surgeon Ceneral's report
might spur even further declines.
In view of these problems, one might
normally expect the industry's advertis-
ing to grow more shrill. But the crisis:
hardened tobacco industry is exhibit-
ing notable restraint in curtailing its
advertising aimed at young people-a
nestraint which in the end might' ward
off cries for rigid government controls.

who says the industry has atway.s taken the
position that smoking is an adult custom "-4:
Tobacco company advertising that leaves the
impression outstanding young sportsmen 'sxe
- cigarette smokers should be discouraged. It
may be true that some young athletes smoke,
but credit for their succes4 should not be at-
tributed to smoking.
' While Allen declined to apecify the number
of companies that will drop campus cigarette
advertising, it was understood on good authori-
ty that most of the major companies ate .,in-,
volved.
Allen 'said nothutg about lung cancer -or
heart disease; nor could the Tobacoo Institute's
'decision be interpreted as a method by which
it hopes to protect the young from possible
harm from smoking. The tobacco industry con-
tends that no direct linl: betwen smoking and
diseases has been proved. , 1_•_ .T.
The Tobacco Institute's decision came at a
time when Canadian tobacco manufacturers
have decided to shift their cigarette commerci-
alb to the late evening hours on television and
radio so as to "keep youngsters from getting
the idea that smoking is grotni up and the
thing to do"-in the words of John H. Devlin,
president of Rothmans of Pall Mall and its af-
filiate, Rock City Tobacco.,
° Also, on Madison Avenue in New York it
was reported that several tobacco companie:;
are considering a code of self-regulation that,
among other things, would eliminate athletes
from cigarette ads.
It should' be the policy of every parent,
guardian or-teacher to direct young people
along a path that will be best for their health
and welfare. There are mixed feelings about
the question of smoking, and as long as there
are the wisest action for youthr may be to
avoid the practice.

College Papers Doubt Tobacco Ad
cutoff Would Halt Teen Smoking
OKLAHOMA C I T Y tUP1)-
Three of Oklahoma's leading col-
lege newspapers feel that the de-
cision of the Tobacco Institute to
halt all advertising in college pub-
lications will not affect teen
smoking habits in any way-ex-
cept possibly in the brand chosen.
The schools and papers polled
were the University of Okla-
homa's Oklahoma Daily, Okla-
homa State University's Daily
O'Collegian, and Central' State
College's The Vista.
The Oklahoma Daily reported,
"The Tobacco Institute evidently
took this action in the face of
mounting public pressure to step
up efforts against teen smoking."
Cuts Into Revenue The most noticeable effectL the
three papers said, will be in the
revenue cuts they will suffer. The
Daily estimated an annual Ios- ef
.$6,000; the O'Collegian, b7-10,000,,
and the Vista, $2-3,000. The Vista,
said the figure was about' 50 pcr
cent of its national advertisino:
revenue.
The prevailing opinion was thatt
cigarette ads have not influenced
nonsmokers to start . . . nor will
the absence of cigarette ads in-
fluence students to stop.
J. M. Poynor. advertising anc
business manager of .0U student
publications, said he dbes not be-
lieve elimination of cigarette ad-
vertising will alleviate the situa
tion. He said that many students ,
smoked before entering college. '
He suggested that if all cigarette i
advertising were eliminated, the
problem might be solved.
Would Like to Know
Betty Jones,' summer editor of
the Daily, asked all students who
quit smoking because her paper
quit advertising cigarettes to
."drop us a line."
Both Miss Jones and Herschel
Randolph{ summer editor of the
O'Collegian, said that some ad-
vertising is interesting in itself.
They both cited a weekly column
written by humorist Max Schul-
man and distributed by a cigar-
ette company as being a part of
college life..
EditoriaJly, the O'Colle
glan said, "it is an unrealistic
move because of the. other con:
tacts students h a v e with cig-
iarettes."
All three publications expressed
belief thate the institute would re-
veme the policy within a couple
of years. But until the reversal
comes, none of them knew how
they would fill the gap left by
the accounts.
Miss Jones did present one an-
swer to part of the problem. She
said, "maybe Schulman can make
a contract with an~ aspirin com-
pany pany or somebody so he can keep
writing his columns."

"If we don't make up this

Fitzgerald said today, "We'll

"There will be a renewed

George V. Allen, Tobacco

decided to stop advertising in
college newspapers, maga-

"The industry's position

said. "To avoid any confusion
or misconception in the pub-

manufacturing companies to withdraw
. advertisements from college publications
and cease promotion activities on the
campuses, is a limited, but significant
start toward voluntary reform in tobacco
sales programs. .
: In the face of increasing public pres-

aure, six of the largest cigarette compa-
nies decided to desist from persuading

college youngsters to take up smoking. In
reaching this decision Tobacco Institute
officials pointed out the anomalous posi-
tion in which • the manufacturers find
themselves by not wanting to be'seen bid-
; ding for the younger, patronage.
They evidently want this new busi!-
ness but cannot afford to further offend
the public taste by making obvious over-
lures to young people. Between 2% and
..370 of the Industry's annual sales
growth comes from young adults and that
apparently satisfies the manufacturers.
This welcome reform probably got its
start last autumn when LeRoy Collins,
president of the National Assn. of Broad-
casters, stirred up a not controversy
among his associates with his suggestion
*that the code be revised to curb cigarette
advertising designed to appeal especially
to young people. He also criticized se-
verely sports heroes who permit their
hero status "to be prostituted" i'n tobacco

advertising.
Cigarette advertisers need some com-
mon guidelines, or a focal point from .
wwhich they can shape new policies. They
are highly competitive and therefore hesi-
tant about sitting down and talking over
their problems.
If they are actually looking for a code,,
the British tobacco advertisers have a
good one they could adopt. The Independ-
ent Television Authority en joins themm
from five ob jectionable types of advertis-
ing material:
0 Advertisements that greatly over-
emphasize the pleasure to be derived from •
smoking cigarettes. .
. . *Advertising that features the con-
ventional heroes of youth..
• *Advertisi'ng that appeals to pride,
social prestige, or manliness.
• 0 Advertisements using a fashionable
social setting to support the impression
that cigarette smoking is a "go-ahead"
habit, or an essential part of the pleas-
ures and excitement of modern living.
9 Advertising that strikingly presents
romantic situations geared to exaggerat-
ing the pleasure of smoking. .
THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY'S decision to
withdraw advertising and promotions
geared especially to teen-agers shows at
least in this case, good judgment.

.
A constructive suggestion from
George V. Allen, president of the To-
bacco Institute, proposes that cig-
arette advertising be aimed at adults
rather than young people.
"In keeping with the position of the
industry that smoking is a custom for
adults, cigarette- advertising should
not give a contrary impression," Al-
len said in a statement at Washing-
ton. He suggested that persons fea-
tured- in such advertising be, and ap-
pear to be, adults.
Earlier, tobacco manufacturers had
joined in abandoning advertising in
collegiate publications, a step in the
direction Allen suggests.
Another proposal offered by Mr. Al-
len would shift similarly the direction
of radio and television advertising
from youngsters, something he re-
gards, preferable to "arbitrary re-
striction of sponsorship to certain
hours of the listening or viewing
day." This would appear to take note
of-in a purpose of averting in this
country=Canadian tobacco manufac-
turers voluntarily announcing last
month they would run no cigarette
commercials on radio or television be-
fore 9 p.m.
An industry spending almost a quar-
ter of a billion dollars for advertis-
ing is engaged in the toughest fight
for survival that industry has yet
faced. The tobacco manufacturers
recognize clearly the problem they
face and would appear to be adjust-
ing by facing up to responsibilities
and challenge of public health.

The decision has beel, confirmed by George.
V. Allen,, president of the Tobacco Institute,
who says the industry has atway.s taken the
position that smoking is an adult custom "-4:
Tobacco company advertising that leaves the
impression outstanding young sportsmen 'sxe
- cigarette smokers should be discouraged. It
may be true that some young athletes smoke,
but credit for their succes4 should not be at-
tributed to smoking.
' While Allen declined to apecify the number
of companies that will drop campus cigarette
advertising, it was understood on good authori-
ty that most of the major companies ate .,in-,
volved.
Allen 'said nothutg about lung cancer -or
heart disease; nor could the Tobacoo Institute's
'decision be interpreted as a method by which
it hopes to protect the young from possible
harm from smoking. The tobacco industry con-
tends that no direct linl: betwen smoking and
diseases has been proved. , 1_•_ .T.
The Tobacco Institute's decision came at a
time when Canadian tobacco manufacturers
have decided to shift their cigarette commerci-
alb to the late evening hours on television and
radio so as to "keep youngsters from getting
the idea that smoking is grotni up and the
thing to do"-in the words of John H. Devlin,
president of Rothmans of Pall Mall and its af-
filiate, Rock City Tobacco.,
° Also, on Madison Avenue in New York it
was reported that several tobacco companie:;
are considering a code of self-regulation that,
among other things, would eliminate athletes
from cigarette ads.
It should' be the policy of every parent,
guardian or-teacher to direct young people
along a path that will be best for their health
and welfare. There are mixed feelings about
the question of smoking, and as long as there
are the wisest action for youthr may be to
avoid the practice.

-report doesn't leak out before it can be edited, this column can
state that the individual studies contain overwhelming evidence

This column also talks about the Neuberger book, attitude of Government
officials such as Secretary Celebrezze' of the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare, and Secretary Freeman of the Department of
Agriculture.
The column mentions three Committee members and says Prof. William
Cochran has compiled "staggering'statistical evidence" against ciga-

causes pre-cancer changes in lung'tissue, and that Dr. Walter Burdette
gives a"'sobering study" of the harmful effects on babies of smoking by
pregnant women.

Dr. Joseph Berkson writing in The Cancer Bulletin, challenges the statistical

. There Is a "distinct and real
possibility" that the studies'
results stemmed from a "sta-
l tistical fallacy In the data,"
he said.
The statements by Dr. Jo-
seph Berkson, "dean of Amer-
ican medical statisticians" and
a non - smoker himself, were
contained in the May - June
issue of The Cancer Bulletin.
A Mayo Clinic researcher yesterday challenged
statistical studies that linked cigaret smoking with a
constitutional difference that
makes some persona smokers
and others non-smokers.
He said that In the past dec-
ade, although perhaps almost a
biUion dollars has been allo-
cated by the U.S. Public Health
Service for cancer investiga-
tion, so far as he knew, "little
or none" has been expended
"for the experimental Investi-
gation of this particular prob-
iem of smoking and lung can-
cer."
Another report rafsing ques-
tions on the relationship of
cigaret smoking and lung
cancer is contained in the June
Issue of "California Medicine."
GENETIC FACTORS

' The possible error, he said,
could stem from the fact that
Its author, Dr. Leroy Hyde,
of Long Beach, said recent
studies re-emphasized the im-
portance of genetic factors.
They also have shown a large
umber of significent psyeho-

ers and non-smokers.
He pointed, too, to arowing

the populations studied were
not a random sample of the
U.B. population "or any de-
fined segment of it."
They were made "on the men
who answered the question-
naii'es;" he said.
Trying to extend such find-
ings to the general population
could be misleading, lhe went
on.
Dr. Berkson also declared
there was "a widespread mis-
understanding"' that t h e s e
studies "showed smokers to
have a higher death rate from
lung cancer than non-smok-
ers "
To discover the scientific ex-
planation of these "extraordi-

problem in hand. one possibil-
ity, he said,, is some unknown
such as those with bronchial
asthma, Dr. F1yde said, "the

rying To Destroy Tobacco lndustr

Warehouse Associatian Is Ur ;e
To Marshal For Counterattacks
By ERNEST L. CLARK
Courler.JeurnN FarM adlfer
French Lick, Ind., June 10.-Two speakers at the Burley
Autcion Warehouse Association's 17th annual convention
here Monday blasted "antitobacco" forces at work trying
.to destroy the tobacco industry and both called for a mar-
shaling of forces to flght :`t.
Edwin P. Finch, executive
vice-president of Brown &amp;
Williamson Tobacco Corpora-
tion, Louisville, said antitobac-
co activities have been revived
`in recent years and the at-
tacks are based on the health

issue.
Finch, slated to become
president of the cigarette-mak-
ing company early in 1964,
declared:~
"We know of organized ef-
forts throughout the nation to
campaign vigorously against
the use of tobacco. These ef-
forts are intensifying and we
may find matters coming to
a head in the next few
months."
Report Expected
He referred to a report ex-
pected from the surgeon gen-
eral of the United States on
the effects of cigarette smok-
ing and the final results of
legislation now before Con-
gress which would affect label-
ing and advertising of ciga-
rettes.
"For years tobacco has been
a karget of the tax collector.
Fuh year State legislatures seee
fit to pile on more taxes on
the assumption that the ciga-
rette smoker is a goose who
will not squawk," Finch said.
"Unfortunately, all too often,
the goose has proved them
correct."
'3 Distinct Threats'
Finch said the one ultimate
• goal of all these efforts is
"to destroy the tobacco indus-
try," and he called for all see
ments of the industry to unite
to fight it.
Dr., Frank J. 'Welch, execu-
tive vice-president of the To-
bacco Institute, Washington,
said there are three distinct
threats to the industry on the
national level.
One is a bill that would
require labeling the active tarss
and nicotine content of each
package. In testimony before
Congress 13 laboratories were
unable to agree on how this
would be done, he said.
The other two bills would
restrict the advertising, sale,
and distribution of cigarettes
by placing regulation of the
industry under the Pure Food
and Drug Administration.
Welch said he remembered
the "cranberry scare" several
years ago, and said Agriculture
Departments scientists then
said a person would have had
to eat 2 tons of cranberries
to have been affected by the
chemical sprayed on them. Yet
the fear was there and the
publicity harmful to the indus-
try, he continued.
Points To Questions
Welch, a former dean of' the
University of Kentucky College
of Agriculture and former as-
sistant secretary of agriculture,
said before the use of tobacco
is condemned as a health
menace certain questions need
to be answered:
1. Why after years of re-
search does the case against
smoking still rest largely on
statistics without clinical and
laboratory verification?
2. Why have years of experi-
mentatiop consistently failed to
produce Iung cancer in animals
by inhalation of t o b a c c o
smoke?
3. Why have chemical tests
varieties of tobacco and allow
DR. FRANK J. WELCH" .
been unable -to establish any
substance, as found in smoke,
that accounts for lung cancer?
4. Why is the lung-cancer
death rate in the British Isles
about twice as high as in the
United States even though per
capita cigarette smoking is
much higher here?
5. Why , is there a sharp
variation in lung-cancer ratess
from city to city and country
to country irrespective of
smoking patterns?
6. Why doesn't the disease
strike a higher proportion of
women, since they have been
smoking more and more in
the past' 30' years? About 30
years ago there were t h r e e
male deaths from lung cancer
for every female death, but
today the ratio is six men to
every woman.
To Be Challenged
Welch said the industry will
be challenged with proposed
restrictive legislation in 19.
State legislatures next year and
called for an organized effort
in every state, including all
segments of the tobacco in-
dustry, to combat it.
Members Monday passed a
resolution calling on the Uni.
versity of Kentucky and the
University of Tennessee ex-
periment stations .to aet up
~ committees to evaluate new
manufacturers to test the
tobaccos for smoking qualities
before the seed is released
to growers,
Albert G. Clay, Mount Sterl-
ing, Ky., president' of the asso-
ciation, cautioned growers that
unless flue-cured and burley
quality improves we might see
another disagreeable market
season with a bigger percent-
age of tobacco going under
Government loan.
He said because of new,
cultural practices a n d in-
creased yields per acre, burley,
quality has been affected and
this could result in the loss
of the U. S. share of the•
world's export mlrket:

Governrrient's Giving

Anti-Cigarette Advice
C.rtiAghl "HA7 Miens.ells fler wW ' Trliun. C."."
Although two out of' every three Mini
nesotans believe cigarette smoking has
beeti proved to be a health hazard, state
residents tend to oppose the ldea of having
the federal government start a campaign
against smoking cigarettes.
Such an attitude toWard smoking is i'n-
` dicatea in a statewide survey by the Min-
• neapolis Tribune's Minnesota poll.
'.One-half of the people interviewed (50
per cent) think the federal government
should not try to discourage people from
smoking cigarettes, as is being done in
Great Britain. Forty-fourr per cent say
that it should be undertaken.
The remaining 6 per cent are moncom-
mittal.
The American Cancer Society, the
American Heart Association, and other
organizations have been actively publicir-
ing the dangers they say are associated
with the smoking of cigarettes.
TAKING AN opposing view Is the to-
bacco indusiry, which denies any cause-
and-effect relationship has been estab-
lished between cigarette smoking and lung
cancer or heart disease.
To learn how Minnesota adults, aged 'LI
and over, look at the subjecC, poll' field re-
porters asked a balanced sampling of resi«
dents.
"From what bori have heard or read, do
you believe that cigarette smoking has or
.has not been proved to be a health hazardl"
About two out of every five persons
questioned are cigarette smokers; the re-
mainder are not. The views of both groups:
' Clgar-
AI1 ette 'Non-
smokers

Has not been proved.. 29 42 20
No opinion....:., ..... 4 4 4
.~ r
190% 100% 100%
The main ways cigarette smoking Is A
health hazard, in the opinion of people
having that viewpoint, are (1) It' leads to
throat or lung cancer; (2) smoking is harm•
ful to lungs-and throat, causing respira-
tory troubles; (3) smoking ia hard on the
heart, raises blood pressure, and,leads to..
heaEt disease.
Minnesotans also were asked:
"In Great Britain, the government Is
carrying on a campaign to discourage peo-
ple from smoking ctparettes. Do you think
our federal got&gt;ernment should or should
not start the same kind of campaign in
this country?"
The answers:

People object to a government drive
against smoking mainly on the grounds
that "the individual should decide foi• hirtn-
self whether he. will smoke" or that "'peo-
ple would smoke anyway, in spite of what
the government might say."
Six•out of 10 Minnesota adults under 40
gars of age (61 per cent) oppose having
e government give advice on smok-

Points To Questions •
•Welch, a former dean of the
University of Kentucky College
of Agriculture and former as-
sistant secretary of agriculture,
said before the use of tobacco
is condemned as a health
menace certain questions need
to be answered:
1. Why after years of re-
search does the case against
smoking still rest' largely on
statistics without clinical and
laboratory verification?
2. Why have years of experi.
mentation consistently failed tc
produce lung cancer in animals
by inhalation of t o b a c c c
smoke?
3. Why have chemical tests
been unable to establish any
substance, as found in smoke,
that accounts for lung cancer?
4. Why is the lung-cancer
death rate in the British Isles
about twice as high as in the
United States even though per
capita cigarette smoking is„
much higher here? •
5. Why, is there a sharp
variation in lung-cancer rates .
from city to city and country
to country irrespective of
smoking patterns?
6. Why doesn't' the disease
strike a higher proportion of
women, since they have been
smoking more and more in
the past 30 years? About 30
years ago there were t h r e e
male deaths from lung cancer
for every female death, but'
today the ratio is six men to
every woman.

the health scare associated
with smoking. His comments
emphasize, however, not only
the need for *research to find

All segments of the, tobacco `+

great stake in the industry's
concern over and research into

there is no scientific proof that .

ever, that stepped-up research `
efforts are required in all areas `
oi the tobacco business Af the `
tobacco economy is to remain

The decision has beel, confirmed by George.
V. Allen,, president of the Tobacco Institute,
who says the industry has atway.s taken the
position that smoking is an adult custom "-4:
Tobacco company advertising that leaves the
impression outstanding young sportsmen 'sxe
- cigarette smokers should be discouraged. It
may be true that some young athletes smoke,
but credit for their succes4 should not be at-
tributed to smoking.
' While Allen declined to apecify the number
of companies that will drop campus cigarette
advertising, it was understood on good authori-
ty that most of the major companies ate .,in-,
volved.
Allen 'said nothutg about lung cancer -or
heart disease; nor could the Tobacoo Institute's
'decision be interpreted as a method by which
it hopes to protect the young from possible
harm from smoking. The tobacco industry con-
tends that no direct linl: betwen smoking and
diseases has been proved. , 1_•_ .T.
The Tobacco Institute's decision came at a
time when Canadian tobacco manufacturers
have decided to shift their cigarette commerci-
alb to the late evening hours on television and
radio so as to "keep youngsters from getting
the idea that smoking is grotni up and the
thing to do"-in the words of John H. Devlin,
president of Rothmans of Pall Mall and its af-
filiate, Rock City Tobacco.,
° Also, on Madison Avenue in New York it
was reported that several tobacco companie:;
are considering a code of self-regulation that,
among other things, would eliminate athletes
from cigarette ads.
It should' be the policy of every parent,
guardian or-teacher to direct young people
along a path that will be best for their health
and welfare. There are mixed feelings about
the question of smoking, and as long as there
are the wisest action for youthr may be to
avoid the practice.

Dr. Joseph Berkson writing in The Cancer Bulletin, challenges the statistical
association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.' His views were reported
in news stories including a syndicated article by John Troan.
JOURNAL AMERICAN

HELD UNPROV EN
higher death rate.
. There Is a "distinct and real
possibility" that the studies'
results stemmed from a "sta-
l tistical fallacy In the data,"
he said.
The statements by Dr. Jo-
seph Berkson, "dean of Amer-
ican medical statisticians" and
a non - smoker himself, were
contained in the May - June
issue of The Cancer Bulletin.
A Mayo Clinic researcher yesterday challenged
statistical studies that linked cigaret smoking with a
constitutional difference that
makes some persona smokers
and others non-smokers.
He said that In the past dec-
ade, although perhaps almost a
biUion dollars has been allo-
cated by the U.S. Public Health
Service for cancer investiga-
tion, so far as he knew, "little
or none" has been expended
"for the experimental Investi-
gation of this particular prob-
iem of smoking and lung can-
cer."
Another report rafsing ques-
tions on the relationship of
cigaret smoking and lung
cancer is contained in the June
Issue of "California Medicine."
GENETIC FACTORS
_ NOT REPRESENTATIVE
' The possible error, he said,
could stem from the fact that
Its author, Dr. Leroy Hyde,
of Long Beach, said recent
studies re-emphasized the im-
portance of genetic factors.
They also have shown a large
umber of significent psyeho-
ogic variables between sunok-
ers and non-smokers.
He pointed, too, to arowing
evidence incriminatinr air pot-
lntion.
While cigaret smoking may
IMMEDIATE PROBLEM be harmful to some persons,,
the populations studied were
not a random sample of the
U.B. population "or any de-
fined segment of it."
They were made "on the men
who answered the question-
naii'es;" he said.
Trying to extend such find-
ings to the general population
could be misleading, lhe went
on.
Dr. Berkson also declared
there was "a widespread mis-
understanding"' that t h e s e
studies "showed smokers to
have a higher death rate from
lung cancer than non-smok-
ers "
To discover the scientific ex-
planation of these "extraordi-
nary findings," he said, is the
problem in hand. one possibil-
ity, he said,, is some unknown
such as those with bronchial
asthma, Dr. F1yde said, "the
casual relat'ionship of eigaret
tsmoking to lung cancer Is cer-
tainly unnroved."

Congratulations California Doctors!
CONGRhTULAlT:OYS' AND commenda-
tions to the California Medical Asso-
ciation - first medical society in the
United States to officially acknowledge
that cigarette smoking is harmful. The
C.1fA adopted a resolution at Its confer-
ence last week to launch a campaign
to educate the public in the "harmful ef-
fects and the health hazards of cigarette
Fmoke."
Vyisely, the association decided to
start:,by putting its own house in order.
It will urge all smoking doctors to give
up smoking and try to persuade their
patients to do the same. This example no
doubt will do more goo&amp; than all the ad-
:monitions and directives the doctors can
give.
Now that the California association
has taken the lead in this country in this
vital public health project, it can be ex-
pected that other state medical societies
will fall into line. Why should not' the
Utah Medical Association join the move-
ment? Our doctors know quite as much,
probably more, than any others the rea-
sons -men„ women and their youngsters
should not smoke. It' would be most
reassuring to have them come out strong-
ly against the tobacco habit.
Tobacco was linked with lung cancer
and heart disease last autumn~ by phy.si-
cians at the American Medtcal Associa-
tion meeting in Chicago, and one doctor
:.proposed that ciaarcttes he labeled
"harmful to health." Annther urged a
50^:, tax on tobacco advertising to curtail
promotion activities encouratcing youn ;
people to smoke. Scverai ph.,,icians told
nf "tobacco tragedies" which have been
"killine a lot of people."
Parents who don't want their children
to smoke had better give up the habit
themselves, warned the American Can-
cer Society in its recent eonference in
Washington. It disclosed the result of a
survey which showed that millions of
.teen-agers are cultivating the cigarette
habit, despite all, the medical warnings
of recent years that it maye contribute to
lung cancer and heart disease. It • urged
the parents of one third of our high
school students who are regular smokers
to set the good example before these
young people and "throw away the weed."
. The U.S. Public Health Service deter-
mined in a recent study that the infant
born to a cigarette-smoking mother is
likely to be smaller at birth than the
baby of a non-smoking mother. Of the
7,500 women taking part in the smoking
study, 11.6 a who smoked delivered pre-
mature babies. Among women who did
not smoke, 7.7qa gave birth to prema-
ture babies.
Britain's Royal College of Physicians,
the British Ministries of Health and Ed-
ucation, the Italian government, which
has banned all cigarette advertising, and
the Danish Health Commission have is-
sued or circulated reports linking smok-
ing and cancer.
SCIENTISTS, DOCTORS, and organi¢a-
. tions that believe smoking is harmful
are increasing in numbers and are step-
ping up their efforts to induce smokcrs
to give up their habit. Action by the Cal-
ifornia Medical Association supports this
ccntention. These organizations ard ex-
perts have given~ us the facts. It would'
hc shcer stupidity to ignore them.

LIVE FOREVER ? HERE'S HOW
We take note again of the alleged scientists, reform-
ers and Dr. Killjoys who keep telling us all we'll live longer
by staying away from cigarets, which these persons believe
cause lung cancer and heart disease.
The Dr. Killjoys et a]. admit that their evidence Is
purely statistical. That means they collect coincidences-
cases of people who (1) smoked cigarets and (2) died
eventually of lung cancer or heart trouble-and then con-
clude that the cigarets caused the fatal diseases.
There is no laboratory evidence that cigarets ever gave
lung cancer.or heart disease to a single human being. Also,
the killjoys soft-pedal the statistical
PlayingWith fact that most cigaret smokers get
Statistics neither lung cancer nor heart disease.
But let''s play for a moment with
thia notion that you'll live longer statistically if you don't
smoke. Taking off from that notion, you can work out a
-statistical formula for living, not merely 'longer, but for-
ever. Here's how you do it:
-There are three things that. every human being has
done or does, from the first human being to today's new-
est baby.
Those three things are: - (1) to breathe air, '(2) to
drink water, and (3) to eat food of Bomg-kind.
THE LENOIR COUNTSC NEWS
Kingston, North Carolina
June 13: 1963
And,there is one thing that has happened or willl hap-
pen to ever3- human being ever born in this world. That :
one thing is death-the departure from this world to, as
most of us hope and believe, a better world somewhere. -.?**
Wlien you put' together the facts stated in the two pre=
ceding'paragraphs, what do you get-bearing in mind that both facts are statistics concerning human beings ? ~..
If you believe firmly in statistics and statistical evi-
dence,,and to hell with laboratory proof, you can come..to :'
only one logical conclusion.
This conclusi'omis that the prime and universal causes
of human death are the breathing of air, the drinking. of
water, and the eating of food. You've got to believe that,
or betray your beloved statistics.
F'.
Hence, statistically, the way to live forever Is simply
to refrain from eating, drinking water, and breathing.
And by failing to ballyhoo this prescription for life eternal
on earth, tha statistical enemies of the cigaret are shirk-
ing their duty to humanity. "``.'
Ridiculous? Sure. But let's see anybody pick a logi-
ca1 flaw in this argument. Until somebody does, let's go on
giving the horselaugh to the enemies of the cigaret.

Cancer, Smoking
Subject. of Book
By Jack M. Bickham
ONE MILLION children now In
our schools may die of lung cancer,'
a new book warns. -
The book is "Consumer's Union
Report on Smoking and the Public
Interest" (Simon and S c h u s t e r,
$3.50), and CU suggests that the can- •
cer tragedy can be averted simply
by education.
The CU book itself is a possible .
first step in the sort of education
that's needed. It's an indictment of
the tobacco habit.
The. Consuitteft'tJnion, publisher of
"Consuiner Reports," was ahowing
frightening facts about cigarets and
lung ,car+cer ' well. before a better-
known digest' magazine scared great
.numbers of smokers into trying to
.quit and then changing to filter-tips.
The CU report opens with medical
evidence, including the fact that lung
cancer deaths have risen from 371 in
1914 to-36,420 In 1960. It adduces sta-
tistics showing no sueh Increase in
• religious sects that forbid smoking-
thus demolishing the argument that
better diagnosis and-or. industrial
fumes, etc., might account for. the
;tise in lung ,cancer charts.
; CU does not say that"
.smoking ne-
cessarily causes lung cancer In ev-
ery smoker, and does not say smok-
ing is the only cancer cause. But'the
book also`presento evidence of a
relationship between smoking and
bronchial infections,,' heart disease,
nUcers and respiratory ailments.
', Children and y o,u n g adults
must be' warned of the dangers of
pmoking, CU notes,, if the present
tres)d, to more and_:ninre'tobacco-re-
lated deaths .is to be r:e v e r s e d.
•Charts - indicate one milliom children

2z~ G: v:-By FRED HIXSON :.. .
Air pollution may be more to
blame for lung cancer than eig-
arette smoking. according to a
leading pathologist appearing onn
a symposium program here Mon-
day.
Declaring that "there are epi-
demilogical correlations between
the prevalence of lung cancer and,
specific air pollution situations,"'
Dr. G. W. H. Schepers told the;
The Du Pont pathologist,
touching upon the question of
air pollution, chronic bronchitis
and emphysema, said:
. . !lNot only are bronchitis and
emphysema likely to 'be fos-
tered by air pollution, but also
lung cancer. Many p e o p 1 e
have tried to link lung cancer
with cigarettes. I am not saying
there is_ not a link between
cigarette smoking and cancer,
but I do say that cigarettes are
' not ,the sole cause. • ; ^ •°°=
"There are chemicals coming
into' our environment that can
be shown In the laboratory to
produce tumors. Among such
chemicals are beryllium com-
pounds, certain types of asbes-
tos, soot and others." ,
Dr. Schepers also discussed the
relation between lung changes
which can be attribtued to air pol-
lution, whether inside a factory or
outside It, and heart disease. He
showed the results of experiments
with rabbits exposed to small par-
ticles of dust. These animals, he
said, which breathed particles of
dust developed increased blood
pressures in proportion to the
length and severity of their ex-
posure. He added that "one has
to speculate whether this is caused
physiologically at the heart level,
or due to the remote effect of in-
haled substances on the other or-
gans, for instance the kidneys."
. Dr. Chapman discussed "Treat-
ment of Chronic Bronchitis and
Emp.`.ysema." The Texas special-
ist said therre is no cure for em-
physema. He descr ibed this di-
sease of the lungs as one which
leaves the tissues "in about the
same condition as a girdle which
aad been thvough the washing
machine too many times."' The
lung tissue, he explained, loses its
'lasticity."
Dr. Chapman gave a rather
;rim reporton emphysema. The
medical profession, he said+ has
not really discovered its cause.

disease," the specialist declarea.

One must also note that these chang '

.Cause of Cancer in Bronchial Tubes
By WALTER C. ALVAREZ, M.D.
I must point out again, as I
have before a number of times in
this column, that some 20 studies
now have shown that people who
are heavy cigarette smokers are
much more
t h a n normally
subject to the
development of
cancer in the.
bronchi' ( th e
tubes w h i c h
carry air into
and out of the ~
lungs). It has

gens--chemical substances which
can produce if repeatedly rubbed
into the skin of a rabbit or a
mouse.
I have been much interested in
the work of Auerbaeh and his cc-
workers who showed the marked
swelling of the inner lining of the
,bronchi that is to be found in peo-
ple who smoke two or three pack-
ages of cigarettes a day. The ex-
tensiveness of these changes goes
hand in hand with the amount of
smoking done. The changes in the',
lining of the bronchi can account'
for a bad cigarette cough, and,
they can accoountfor the fact that
sometimes when a chain-smcker
gets pneumonia, he dies within a
couple of days, because he has
no resistance to infection, •
Another fact which to me is very
significant is that nften in the
much-swollen Inner lining of the~
bronchi of heavy smokers, one can
see what are called "pre-cancer-
ous changes"; in other wcrds, one
can see the beginnings of the can-
cers which will form later.
Because some men have not
been satisfied with the interpreta-
tion of the many studies made of
cigarette smoke and cancer, and
because some have expressed their
belief that heavy smoking and a
high incidence of cancer are both
due to some cause as yet unde-
lermined, it was a good idea to
see if the frequent aplication of
tiny amounts of. a condensate of.
~migarette smoke (some call it cig-
arette arette smoke tar) will' cause bron-
,
chial chial cancer in dogs. These ani-
mals have no "emotional tendency'I
to smoke cigarettes," and theyy
have almost no tendency to de-I
velop bronchial cancer.
Each one of the many dogs used,
first - under anesthesia - had a
little window made through the
skinl of the neck and into the -
trachea (the main tube that runs
from the throat down into the
lungs). Through such a little win-
dow it is easy to pass a lighted
bronchoscope-without hurting the
animal. 'For perhaps five, years
three times a week, a tiny amount
of "cigarette tar" was applied to
the wall of the left main bron-
~hus of 130 dogs. Twenty-five oth
r dogs just had the bronchial lin-
ing rubbed a bit, and 27 were not
treated in any way. They 5erved
as "controls"-to show that there
was nothing in the air of the
kennels to make the cancers. Actr
ually; nothing happened to them.

Hang yotir head In sorrow. No longer will we be able
to look forward with miserly glee to the few days each se-
mester when representatives of tobacco companies pass
's:mple cigarettes to the . eager hands of nicotine-hun-
gry students. '
Most of the major cigarette companies announced
'Wednesday that they would discontinue advertising. in col-
:lege newspapers, maga:ines, and football programs. The
reasoning behind this is that smoking is an adult habit. To
'avoid confusion and misconception in the public mind as
tio the position of tobacco companies on this issue, they wilt
discontinue advertising. This policy win also exclude hiring
of cigarette repreaentatives on campus and passing out of
free samples.
As far as we know, no tests have ever been given to
determine when enoat people start smoking and for what
reasons. It seems, however, that most people have begun to
amoke before coming to college and that the remaining
smokers do not' begin to smoke because of advertising. For
those who do smoke, tobacco• .advertisers a r e some-
times influential.
It would seem, then, that'the tobacco industries are
"eutting o!f their noses to spite their faces." This new
policy may create good will, but it is doubtful if it will sell
more cigarettes - and this is what tobacco companies aim
to do. We encourage tobacco•companies to realize the ma-
turity of college students and to continue past advertis-
ing practice.

gry students. '
Most of the major cigarette companies announced
'Wednesday that they would discontinue advertising. in col-
:lege newspapers, maga:ines, and football programs. The
reasoning behind this is that smoking is an adult habit. To
'avoid confusion and misconception in the public mind as
tio the position of tobacco companies on this issue, they wilt
discontinue advertising. This policy win also exclude hiring
of cigarette repreaentatives on campus and passing out of
free samples.
As far as we know, no tests have ever been given to
determine when enoat people start smoking and for what
reasons. It seems, however, that most people have begun to
amoke before coming to college and that the remaining
smokers do not' begin to smoke because of advertising. For
those who do smoke, tobacco• .advertisers a r e some-
times influential.
It would seem, then, that'the tobacco industries are
"eutting o!f their noses to spite their faces." This new
policy may create good will, but it is doubtful if it will sell
more cigarettes - and this is what tobacco companies aim
to do. We encourage tobacco•companies to realize the ma-
turity of college students and to continue past advertis-
ing practice.

Statistician Takes Dim View
Smoking-Cancer Figures
$y Robert S. Kleckner

A doctor at Mayo Clinic
whom the Cancer B u l l e t i n
terms the dean of American
medical statisticians has cast
doubt on assertions that cigaret
smoking can be pinpointed as
the cause of lung cancer. -Despite the doctofs asser-
tions, the American Cancer So-
ciety has insisted that cigarets
apparently are one cause of
lung cancer and many physi-
~ ctaes apve.
The Mayo doctor's views
.:i were pnb!'ished in the bulletin,
a recognized professional jour-
nal, which recommended the
article be read to look at "the
other side of the coin "
'AtxeW6ere Of Emstise'
The bulletin is published' by

cer experts as Doctors Kenneth

Cancer Institute, Bethesda. Md.;
Charles Huggins, University of
Chicago, and Danley P. Slaugh-
ter, University of Illinois.
The Mayo physician, Dr.
Joseph Berkson, ' head of the
Division of Biometry and Medi-
cal Statistics there since 1932,
wrote:
"The whole discussion (of the
cigaret-lung cancer controversy)

Dr. Berkson continued:
"Maybe the reason scientists
in general are not trying to
find the cause of lung cancer
in tobacco smoke is that they
don't really believe it contains
the cause."
Total Deaths Decline
He suggested there had been
about as much lung cancer, in
the past but that it had not
been recognized. Dr. Berkson
added:, ,
"While the reported death
rate, from lung cancer has been
increasing, the total death rate
from all causes has not been
increasing, but, instead, has
been decreasing.
"The reported rise of the
death rate from. lung cancer
can be questioned because of
the inaccuracy in the past in
stating this cause of death on
death certificates."
Dr. Berkson wrote that while
the death rates from all causes
were greater among smokers in
the statistics from the popula-
tion studied, these segments
neither were defined nor se-
lected at random.
"The studies," he said, "were
made on the men who answered

(Just recently, the U. S. Pub-

'Huge Blunders'
He asserted it "is no seciet

wrote:
"The public has been made

before, and cigaret sales have
~mounted. The tobacco industry
and those who own tobacco
stock, of whom, unhappily I
am not one, have benefitted.
But has anyone else?"
hteanwhile, Chicago Medi-
cine,-the official publication ot
the Chicago Medical Society,
said editorially that more and
more hospitals in this area have
eliminated cigaret vending ma-

With `Huge Blunders' Committed Already

By JOHN TROAN
Scripps-Howard Science Writer
Figures DO lfe, a well-known health statistician in-
sists. And as far as Mayo Clinic's Dr. Jor~eph Berkson is
concerned, the figures linking cigaret smoking to lung
cancer don't even add up to a half-truth.
the Cancer Bulletin, a Uni-
versity of Texas publication
for physicians, "this is
about a 15 per cent truth."
- The doctor points out that
among persons covered by the
statistical studies "smokers
S have a higher
death rate from
all causes to-
gether" - with
lung cancer ac-
counting for no
more than 15 per
- _ _ cent of "the to-
tal excess."
Doesn't this in-
dict cigaret
smoking even
more? Not at all,
Dr. Berkson re-
torts.

"The idea that cigaret smok-
ing causes all these many
deaths from all these many
causes does, indeed, seem se-
riously questionable," he -says.
"`phere Is not any scientifical-

Actually, Dr. Berkson con-
tends, "we are not within a

mean.
The doctor, however, does
offer some possible explana-
tions:
RESEARCHERS who claim

• have committed "huge blun-

'PIiERE Is "a constitutional

Says True Meaning of Figures Unknown,

With `Huge Blunders' Committed Already

By JOHN TROAN
Scripps-Howard Science Writer
Figures DO lfe, a well-known health statistician in-
sists. And as far as Mayo Clinic's Dr. Jor~eph Berkson is
concerned, the figures linking cigaret smoking to lung
cancer don't even add up to a half-truth.
the Cancer Bulletin, a Uni-
versity of Texas publication
for physicians, "this is
about a 15 per cent truth."
- The doctor points out that
among persons covered by the
statistical studies "smokers
S have a higher
death rate from
all causes to-
gether" - with
lung cancer ac-
counting for no
more than 15 per
- _ _ cent of "the to-
tal excess."
Doesn't this in-
dict cigaret
smoking even
more? Not at all,
Dr. Berkson re-
torts.

"The idea that cigaret smok-
ing causes all these many
deaths from all these many
causes does, indeed, seem se-
riously questionable," he -says.
"`phere Is not any scientifical-

Actually, Dr. Berkson con-
tends, "we are not within a

1ng" what these statistics do
mean.
The doctor, however, does
offer some possible explana-
tions:
RESEARCHERS who claim
eigarets cause lung cancer
• have committed "huge blun-
ders" through "uncritical use
of statistics."
'PIiERE Is "a constitutional
diSerence between smokers
and ron-smokers.° (The non-

It may easily go into 1964. A

its release will be sometime
thereafter.

committee's report would be

~hq latest postponement.
--••Some scientists within the
service, and others at the Na-
ttoaal Cancer Institute, have
taken to calling the panel a
"flat earth committee."
"You can always get a com-

pigined.
'They examine all the evi-

;'We've incomparably better'

lung cancer," said Dr. Michael
Shimkin,.a former Public Health
Seivice official now at the Tem-

The evidence appears to be
in•_qne direction.
• In March, 1962, the Royal
CeTlege of Physicians in Eng-
land published a report' that held
Sn4oking responsible for lung
cancer.
The California Department
of Y3ealth this summer made its

times more chance of dying of

Qnother Attack Brewing
Reports that the government is preparing to issue
' through its Public Health Division a new and formid-
I41 able attack on tobacco is causing the industry some
. concern, because it now appears to be. a vindictive
` assault which can only do harm to one industry which
pours tax money into the treasury. =..:
Tobacco Institute, which is looking after the in-
dustry's interests, reminds us that the theory about cig-
arette smoking: and health has been repeated so often
that many have forgotten it is still just a theory l.ack-
:,,.ing clinical and laboratory verification.
The public should not ignore the opinion of Dr.
Joseph Berkson, head of inedical statistics at Mayo
clinic, that "statistical studies must be confirmed by.
`, experimental studies and other different types of in-
,.;:vestigation-and this has not happened. The fact is
there Is
a dispute among scientists as.to the causes of
lung cancer and heart disea,se and much more must be
learned before it will be known whether any of the
factors, now under study has a role in causation."

Accurate, but not right
The Tobacco Industry Research Committee has
ef£ered an impressive answer to the American
Heart Assn.'s recent anti-smoking resolution. TJn-
fortunately, it is not an answer,to the points the
Heai-t Assn. raised.

With the technically precise logic that has mark-
e i most of its recent R+a,tements, the TIRC declares
that "statistical association does not prove causal
relationship." This is quite true and it is also
Irrelevant. The Heart Assn. didn't claim 'any "cau-
sal relationship" between smoking and heart dis-
ease. What it did claim was that the available evi-
dence - admittedly circumstantial - is sufficient
cause for concern, especially when it comes to
smoking by teenagers and "high-risk" individuals.
The TIRC had better shake off the notion that.
to be technically accurate is to be right. It is not '

LIVE FOREVER ? HERE'S HOW
We take note again of the alleged scientists, reform-
ers and Dr. Killjoys who keep telling us all we'll live longer
by staying away from cigarets, which these persons believe
cause lung cancer and heart disease.
The Dr. Killjoys et a]. admit that their evidence Is
purely statistical. That means they collect coincidences-
cases of people who (1) smoked cigarets and (2) died
eventually of lung cancer or heart trouble-and then con-
clude that the cigarets caused the fatal diseases.
There is no laboratory evidence that cigarets ever gave
lung cancer.or heart disease to a single human being. Also,
the killjoys soft-pedal the statistical
PlayingWith fact that most cigaret smokers get
Statistics neither lung cancer nor heart disease.
But let''s play for a moment with
thia notion that you'll live longer statistically if you don't
smoke. Taking off from that notion, you can work out a
-statistical formula for living, not merely 'longer, but for-
ever. Here's how you do it:
-There are three things that. every human being has
done or does, from the first human being to today's new-
est baby.
Those three things are: - (1) to breathe air, '(2) to
drink water, and (3) to eat food of Bomg-kind.
THE LENOIR COUNTSC NEWS
Kingston, North Carolina
June 13: 1963
And,there is one thing that has happened or willl hap-
pen to ever3- human being ever born in this world. That :
one thing is death-the departure from this world to, as
most of us hope and believe, a better world somewhere. -.?**
Wlien you put' together the facts stated in the two pre=
ceding'paragraphs, what do you get-bearing in mind that both facts are statistics concerning human beings ? ~..
If you believe firmly in statistics and statistical evi-
dence,,and to hell with laboratory proof, you can come..to :'
only one logical conclusion.
This conclusi'omis that the prime and universal causes
of human death are the breathing of air, the drinking. of
water, and the eating of food. You've got to believe that,
or betray your beloved statistics.
F'.
Hence, statistically, the way to live forever Is simply
to refrain from eating, drinking water, and breathing.
And by failing to ballyhoo this prescription for life eternal
on earth, tha statistical enemies of the cigaret are shirk-
ing their duty to humanity. "``.'
Ridiculous? Sure. But let's see anybody pick a logi-
ca1 flaw in this argument. Until somebody does, let's go on
giving the horselaugh to the enemies of the cigaret.

ONE MILLION children now In
our schools may die of lung cancer,'
a new book warns. -
The book is "Consumer's Union
Report on Smoking and the Public
Interest" (Simon and S c h u s t e r,
$3.50), and CU suggests that the can- •
cer tragedy can be averted simply
by education.
The CU book itself is a possible .
first step in the sort of education
that's needed. It's an indictment of
the tobacco habit.
The. Consuitteft'tJnion, publisher of
"Consuiner Reports," was ahowing
frightening facts about cigarets and
lung ,car+cer ' well. before a better-
known digest' magazine scared great
.numbers of smokers into trying to
.quit and then changing to filter-tips.
The CU report opens with medical
evidence, including the fact that lung
cancer deaths have risen from 371 in
1914 to-36,420 In 1960. It adduces sta-
tistics showing no sueh Increase in
• religious sects that forbid smoking-
thus demolishing the argument that
better diagnosis and-or. industrial
fumes, etc., might account for. the
;tise in lung ,cancer charts.
; CU does not say that"

cessarily causes lung cancer In ev-
ery smoker, and does not say smok-
ing is the only cancer cause. But'the
book also`presento evidence of a
relationship between smoking and

.Cause of Cancer in Bronchial Tubes
By WALTER C. ALVAREZ, M.D.
I must point out again, as I
have before a number of times in
this column, that some 20 studies
now have shown that people who
are heavy cigarette smokers are
much more
t h a n normally
subject to the
development of
cancer in the.
bronchi' ( th e
tubes w h i c h
carry air into
and out of the ~
lungs). It has

gens--chemical substances which
can produce if repeatedly rubbed
into the skin of a rabbit or a
mouse.
I have been much interested in
the work of Auerbaeh and his cc-
workers who showed the marked
swelling of the inner lining of the
,bronchi that is to be found in peo-
ple who smoke two or three pack-
ages of cigarettes a day. The ex-
tensiveness of these changes goes
hand in hand with the amount of
smoking done. The changes in the',
lining of the bronchi can account'
for a bad cigarette cough, and,
they can accoountfor the fact that
sometimes when a chain-smcker
gets pneumonia, he dies within a
couple of days, because he has
no resistance to infection, •
Another fact which to me is very
significant is that nften in the
much-swollen Inner lining of the~
bronchi of heavy smokers, one can
see what are called "pre-cancer-
ous changes"; in other wcrds, one
can see the beginnings of the can-
cers which will form later.
Because some men have not
been satisfied with the interpreta-
tion of the many studies made of
cigarette smoke and cancer, and
because some have expressed their
belief that heavy smoking and a
high incidence of cancer are both
due to some cause as yet unde-
lermined, it was a good idea to
see if the frequent aplication of
tiny amounts of. a condensate of.
~migarette smoke (some call it cig-
arette arette smoke tar) will' cause bron-
,
chial chial cancer in dogs. These ani-
mals have no "emotional tendency'I
to smoke cigarettes," and theyy
have almost no tendency to de-I
velop bronchial cancer.
Each one of the many dogs used,
first - under anesthesia - had a
little window made through the
skinl of the neck and into the -
trachea (the main tube that runs
from the throat down into the
lungs). Through such a little win-
dow it is easy to pass a lighted
bronchoscope-without hurting the
animal. 'For perhaps five, years
three times a week, a tiny amount
of "cigarette tar" was applied to
the wall of the left main bron-
~hus of 130 dogs. Twenty-five oth
r dogs just had the bronchial lin-
ing rubbed a bit, and 27 were not
treated in any way. They 5erved
as "controls"-to show that there
was nothing in the air of the
kennels to make the cancers. Actr
ually; nothing happened to them.

National Campaign Proposed
t Out Cigarets,
•
~te 1Vledics Url~
By JOHN MELDER
and
JACK GUARNIERI
Narala Staff Wrltns .
A resolutiori urging tl:e
•formation of a nation:
wide program aimed at con-
vincing people to stop smok-
ing cigarets was unanimous-
ly passed Sunday by the
Florida Medical Associatiom
The resolution, passed by
the Dade County Medical' As-
sociation May 7, put the F&amp;fA
for the first time officially
on record against' cigaret
smoking.
; The group met at thr
Diplomat Hote1 In Hollywood.
Emphatic in its opposition
to cigarets, the resolution
contained one statement
w•hichsead:
Dr. * Daughtry said the
FMA was prompted to action
on the controversial ques-
tion of "the health dangers
of cigaret smoking for two
reasons:
1. "The public is reluctant
to accept the fact that cig-
arets are dangerous.
2. "Misleading statements
by the tobacco indu.stry Qn
the hazards of smoking" have
clouded the question.
"One hundred per cent of
welli - controlled studies have
,hown," he said, "there is a
direct connection between
cigaret smoking and cancer.
"•In my 20 years as a eheat
surgeon, most of the death
certificates I have, signed
were due to conditions which
were either caused or aggra-
vated by smoking."
Filter cigarets, he said,
don't' give much protection to
the smoker.
"If it filters out the harm-
ful substances, the cigaret
has no taste. One filter cig-
aret that gave protection was
not accepted by the public."
he said.
Nicotine causes the habit.
The person who stops shows
signs of neurotic withdrawal
much like that of a narcotic
addict who quits, Dr. Daugh-
try said.
"Eventually, It will be
necessary to pass a state law
outlawing cigaret vending
other resolution which would
have permitted medical doc-
tors to associate profession-
y ally and consult with osteo-
paths.
Dr. Samuel M. Day of
Jacksonville was named pres-
ident-elect of the association.
to take effice next year. Dr.
Warren W. Qutlllan of Coral
Gables assumed the presi-
dency Sunday.
Other new officers are Dr.
H. Phillip Hampton of Tam-
pa, vice president, and Dr.
Floyd K Hurt of Jack-
sonville, secretary-treasurer.
"The preponderance of e%i-
dence indicates that cigaret.
smoking Is strongly impfl-
cated in the genesis of lung
cancer, chronic ' bronchitis.
and anphysema (a chronic
lung disease)." ,
-- --'"" -Dr. ISeWitt C. Daughtry, a
Coral' Gables chest surgeon,
was directed to push for pas-
sage of the resolution by the
A'mer?can Mediral ;ssncih-
tion at its mid - June con-
vcntion in Atlantic City.
As approved by 218 FMA
delegates from every county
in the state, the resolution
also directed the state me.d-
ical group to support and en-
courage programs desiened
to influence young people not
to start smoking.

Editorials on various'sub3ects continue to be received.
'omment Of The
TOBACCO AND TEENAGERS
un the basis of information at present available
we can hoid the following facts to be ineontro-
vertible:
. (1) Excessive cigaret smoking is the major
: exciting cause of two lethal conditions of the res-
' piratory system - bronchogenic carcinoma and ob-
structive emphysema. '
(2) Unless recognized and treated early these
diseases are fatal.
(3) They account for the death of many people
including a large number of physicians--And an in-
creasing percentage of women. (That the investi-
gation of the situation planned by the U: S. Public
Health Service will support the facts already doc-
umentpd by studies in this and twenty-two other
countries is a foregone conclusion). -
The control of this menace to public health is
not easy. To persuade a significant number of
"heavy smokers"' to give up the habit is difficult
if not impossible. Some of these people may even
be classed as addicts, as they find that attempts to
stop smoking bring on quite definite symptoms. In
some instances these patients can be helped by
their personal physicians, but the task is anything
but easy. ,
A real solution must lie in the field of proph-
ylaxis, the prevention of those who are not' now
habituated to cigarets from becoming so. This
means primarily the rising generation. A person
who acquires the cigaret habit in adolescence and
: continues smoking one or,more packs a day mark-
edly reduces his chances of a normal life span.
Pulmonary cripples from emphysema and patients
with lung carcinoma are noL uncommon even in
their "forties." The effort to do away with this
serious health hazard to both present and future
adolescents must involve people in many walks of
life: physicians, parents, teachers, and' lelgislators,
to name those who perhaps can accomplish ihe
most.
Physicians can explain the situation to the
heads of families and to their patients generally
as opportunity offers. As might be anticipated, it'

"fs safd that cigaret smoking has decreased. mark-
edly among doctors, but not strikingly as yet in
any other group.
Teachers,` especially in the colleges and high
schools, can accomplish perhaps 'more than can
any other group, not by precept so much as by .
example. This is particularly true •of physical
directors and team coaches. College presidents
; and others. in positions of apthority can contribute
a great deal by seeing to it that free distribution
of cigaret samples to students at dinners and other
gatherings is prohibited, that vending machines
, are removed, and that smoking and cigaret sales
.on university property is restricted. -
Legislators can do a real service by making
illegal much of the seductive advertising that is
carried on through various media. This means, for
example, the outlawing of those seductive scenes
on television in which the rugged athlete or charm-
ing young woman -always ends by inhaling air
polluted by one or another of the competing
brands. (Britain is well ahead of the United
States in this matter).
Efforts to improve the situation should not be
a matter of pseudo-religious fervor but rather a
calm evaluation of the facts and an attempt to
make progress that is definite, though necessarily
gradual. It must be remembered that the tobacco -
Industry involves the livelihood of many • honest
people who are in no way responsible for the re-
cently recognized serious effects of the use of the
products of their labors. If the public is made
really aware of the facts, advertising of cigarets
is curtailed, and everyone involved in the educa-
tion of "teenagers"' does his part, we can look for-
ward to a gradual but steady diminution of the
number of persons who become hopeless invalids
or die before their time as they approach the later
years of life. -(Rhode Island Medical Journalli:

No matter what else Is In-
volved in causing lung cancer,
thereljs a "genetic" or "Yamili-
al" factor in the cause, accord-
ing to two epidemiological
:,• scientists who made the first
studies designed to nail down
something scientists have long
suspected.
. Dr. George K. Tokuhata of
the U.S. Public Health Service
and Dr. A. M. Lilienfeld of the
by factors of age, sex and
generation. It was particular•
Jy "significant" tor female
lung cancer patients. •
The two studies indicated
that some persons may be sus•
ceptible to lung cancer and
other persons may be resistant
to it because of physical con•
stitutlon. This constitution is,
pf course, a complex blending
of Inheritances from ancestors.
Johns Hopkins University, Bal-' •
timore, confirmed the "fam-
illal" factor they found tn
Baltimore lung cancer patients
by finding the 5ame factor in
lung cancer victims of upper
New York State.
Only the Baltimore study
considered the cigaret-smoking
factor and by the statistical
methods employed It was
found to be operatiwe. The
net result was the statistical
suggestion that persons who
would be most susceptible io
it would be members of fam-
ilIes alreadyy visited by luna
cancer.
Foggy Question
Epidemiology is the science
of how diseases get around. tn
cancers of all sorts this is a
foggy question, and one which
Is extremely hard even to ap-
proach. Tokuhata and Lilien-
feld approached it through 361
lung cancer patients of the
Roswell Park Memorial Insti-
tute, Buffalo, N. Y.
Each one they "matched"
with two persons who were
patients in the same hospit'ali
for reasons other than cancer.
"Matching" meant these "con;
trols" were of the same age.
sex, race'and type of commu-
nity of residence as the lung
cancer patients.
Then the scientists exhaus-
tively checked the vitall statis-
tics of blood relatives of cancer
patients and' "controls"-broth,
ers, sisters, parents. They were
looking for the relatives who
had died of lung cancer.
• Classed 'Significant'
More relatives of, lung can
cer patients had,so died than
relatives of "controls." The
preponderance, by the refined'
statistical calculations upon
which science depends for
many answers,, was classed as
"significant."

NEW ORLEANS-(NC)-Fifty-one of 251 nurns

The r e p o r t was released.

chairman of the Committee on
Medical Care of Clergy and Re-

tee is conducting an investiga-

all nuns in the U.S. during 1963.
The report states that'only 12
of the nuns who died were under
50 years old at the time of
death, andI the average age at
death of the nuns was 75 years.
IN ANOTHER REPORT, the

the House of Delegates consid-

at the conclusion of the conven-

of Georgia.
Another physician, seeing doc-
tors smoking during the debate,
argued, "I do not think it is our
business to pass something that
wi1P make us look silly when we
get home."
He looked around the room ai.
his fellow physicians and asked.
"What are you going tn say when
your patients ask you if you have
stopped?"
The motion lost by a wide mar-
gin. Many of the physicians vot-
ing against the resolution said
they are nonsmokers. A few
others stood to vote for the meas-

Dr. Richard Torpin of Augusta

espite Cigarette Scare
ysicians Still Puffin1
By DENNIS HOOVER
News Staff Writer
HALF OF DALLAS' physicians are still puffing despite the
cigarette scare.
But of the doctors who formerly smoked, more than one-
third have quit.
And 90 per cent of the medical men, smokers and non-
smokers alike, believe reports linking cigarettes with lung, heart
and blood vessel diseases are valid.
These inferences are drawn from a survey of 50 physicians
selected at random from the Dallas County Medical Society di-
rectory.
Alibis of the medics who smoke, although professing to know
better, are varied.
"Sure, smoking's related to lung cancer and heart ilisease,"
said a pack-a-day surgeon, age 38. "Just list me as a coward."
"There's no question that the evidence •against cigarettes is
sound," commented an internist .who smokes over a pack a day.
"'We who smoke are damn fools, that's all."
-"Yes, .1 do .think cigarettes are harmful'," said another in-
ternist, age 50, whose vows to quit smoking have all crumbled
to ashes. "Some of us just got started smoking too early in life."
"I've stopped' inhaling," explained a 57-year-old pediatrician
who's had cancer of the throat. He smokes cigars, cigarettes
and pipe.
_ A psychiatrist related that he's been smoking cigarettes 20:` years; adding: "Yes, 1 believe there is a connection between
smoking and'diseases, as the studies show." -
ANOTHER PSYCHiATRIST caused mind to overcome matter.
After 20 years on fags, he ground out his last cigarette
three years ago. "The evidence is completely valid insofar as it
links,cigarettes with lung cancer," he declared. "More facts are
needed where cardiovascular ailments are concerned."
Several of the smoking douEOrs limiG their tobacco indul-
gence to pipes and cigars, which are less suspected of being
d ;ngerous.
Of the physicians who quit smoking in the dpcade since
cigarettes were cast in.the villain's re!e, most chucked the habit
in the past four years.
Chest specialists in the sampling were among the most con-
%inced that smokes play havoc with health. Said one:.
"As a chest surgeon, I can say there is a definite correlation
between smoking and lung cancer. And I am especially im-
pressed with the damage smoking does to people with arterial
disease."
This M.D. and others mentioned that smoking is related to
Buerger's disease-a progressive narrowing of arteries and veins
in the ext'remities, until they close completely and amputation
becomes necessary.
"Some people continue to smoke even after they have lost
toes, feet, legs and fingers„" the surgeon related. "I knew a pa-
tient who kept smoking cigarettes by use of a special holder at-
tached to what was left of his hand."
M ANY OF THE DOCTORS said' there is no doubt whatever
that smoking is the culprit in crippling and often-fatal
pulmonary diseases, notably emphysema,and chronic bronelutL:
Commented a chest specialist who, quit smoking seven yatrts
ago:
..,
.'There is absolutely nothing in the combustion of tobacco
that bodies need. Everything in cigarette smoke is repellutt.
There is tar, two cancer-producing agents and nicotine, which
causes contraction of the capillaries. We know that' any chronic
irritant can cause cancer. Some even think cigerettta are the
last straw that brings on heart attacks." -:: :, r?}c${~;
Declared an internist rovho smoked a•pipe 23 years untIn
be
quit 15 months ago: 4
"The evidence is overwhelming that smoking is helping to P,
kill people from many diseases, but especially lung cancer, •~
cardiovascular ailments such as Buerger's disease and hyper-
, tensibn, chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is also a factor "~
in upper respiratory ailments such as sinus trouble." ~~"4fn
~;
Some of the doctors connected ci tes with
8aret pulmonary ry:
fibrosis and cancer of the larynx
The degree of conviction that cigarettes play a destructive
role ranged from an internist's "I think it's good circumstantial :
evidence and we ought to pay attention to it," to a pathologist'i
"unqualified sure; " a pediatrician's "Undoubtedly cigarettes are '
toxic," and an obstetrician's "Unequivocally, without qualifica-
tion, absolutely."
_ _
The medical men generally agreed with studies indicating
that cigarette damage is proportionate to the quantity smoked.
Several observed that smoking appears to harm some people :
more than others.

THOSE SKEPTICAL of smoking's role in ill health were
mostly waiting for more evidence

"It hasn't been proven conclusively," said a non-smoking
skin specialist:

"I'm not completely sold," commented an anesthetist who~~
lights up more than two packs a day. "Is it smoking that gives ',..~
people heart disease, or is it the hard-driving type of person
prone to heart trouble who smokes?"

"I think the issue is debatable," noted a general pracii-
tioner.
Said an eye specialist who's survived 35 years of puffing:
"I guess I'd have been dead long ago if cigarettes caused can-
cer...
"Presumptive but not proven," said a general practitioner
of the evidence.
How does a doctor who smokes advise his patients on the
matter?'
"I tell them to quit smoking," was a typical rep!y. "Doctors
are willing to gamble their own health, but not that of their
patients."
,
HAT DO THE DOCTORS think should be done about
W cigarettes?
Several chided United States health and regulatory agencies
for being timid. Declared an obstetrician:
"The EnRlish, and even the Russians, have extensive public

May I supplement your story?
On Apr. 8. 1962, the Maine Medical As-
soc.iation resolved to "acknowledge the catts•
ai relationship between cigaret smoking and
lung cancer and . . . to encourage the dii;-
seminat3on of information regarding (,this)."
Also. la:ct October the Pennsylvania Medical
Society t•ecopized that "the preponderance of the evidence indicates that cigaret smok
inK is implicated in the genesis of lung can-
, c•.er and pro'mbly other di: ea.es."' The
Pennsylvania Society decided to "go on rec-
or•d as advocating the voluntary giving up of
cigaret smoking ...(and) initiate and main-
tain an educational program designed to in-
fluence young people not to start the habit
of smoking cigarets."' In February, the
Ceorgia Medical Society (representing sev-
cral c.ountics. but not the state) passed aa
resolution ,imilar to that voted in Pennsyt-
~ania.
The purpose of this, letter is merely to
point out that Maine was fir~t. And, because
it is known that other state medical socie-
ties will consider similar rcsolution^. the
American Canccr Society foresc•es a trend in
thi:s important area which wonld lend cre-
dence to the adage: "As Maine goes, so'
goes the nation."

morbidity.
Lung Cancer: The Survey states that
deaths from cancer of the respiratory
system have been reported in increas-
ing numbers in many countries during
the past decade, and the rising curve
°of mortality has been rather boldly
described as "symptomatic of an epi-
demic." In some countries, notably
England and Wales, there is patho-
logical evidence suggesting that the
increase started at least forty years
ago. In others, such as Chile and'
Japan, it has been observed only dur-
ing the past ten or fifteen years.
For the United States and Canada
the death rate reached 15.3 and 14.3
Q per 100,000 population respectively.

The experience of Egypt, with a rate
of 2.2 per 100,000 in 1957, can be
regarded as typical. In the same year,,
however, the Jewish population of
Israel had a rate of 13.
Death rates for the majority of
European countries are much higher
than any mentioned so far. Annual
rates as high as 50 per 100;000 are
not uncommon, but other countries
escape with rates at the 15 per 100,-

plicable differences between countries
are encountered. For example, in Fin-

Premature Births ~
Linked to Smoking
Women who are heavy smokers have roughly double
the number of premature babies as do expectant mothers
who abstain from cigarettes, a noted research doctor said
yesterday.
Dr. Brewster Miller, head
ot research, for United Cere-
bral Palsy Assn. and secre-
tary of the World Commis-
sion for Palsy, underscored
the effects of bearing pre-
mature infants by noting 65
per cent of'those youngsters
have brain damage.
He said more rsearch is
needed, particularly into why
women smoke heavily. But,,
he continued, studies in Bal~
timore show 9.2 per cent of
non-smokers bear premature
infants compared to 18 per
cent for addicted smokers.
Dr. Miller's talk in the
Sheraton Hotel marked the
fourth annual banquet of the
Rochester Area Palsy Asso-
ciation. He said there are 77
research programs under

ological ailments such as
palsy.

By DELOS' SMITH
Wntted Prep Internnttonal
No matter what else Is In-
volved in causing lung cancer,
thereljs a "genetic" or "Yamili-
al" factor in the cause, accord-
ing to two epidemiological
:,• scientists who made the first
studies designed to nail down
something scientists have long
suspected.
. Dr. George K. Tokuhata of
the U.S. Public Health Service
and Dr. A. M. Lilienfeld of the
by factors of age, sex and
generation. It was particular•
Jy "significant" tor female
lung cancer patients. •
The two studies indicated
that some persons may be sus•
ceptible to lung cancer and
other persons may be resistant
to it because of physical con•
stitutlon. This constitution is,
pf course, a complex blending
of Inheritances from ancestors.
Johns Hopkins University, Bal-' •
timore, confirmed the "fam-
illal" factor they found tn
Baltimore lung cancer patients
by finding the 5ame factor in
lung cancer victims of upper
New York State.
Only the Baltimore study
considered the cigaret-smoking
factor and by the statistical
methods employed It was
found to be operatiwe. The
net result was the statistical
suggestion that persons who
would be most susceptible io
it would be members of fam-
ilIes alreadyy visited by luna
cancer.
Foggy Question
Epidemiology is the science
of how diseases get around. tn
cancers of all sorts this is a
foggy question, and one which
Is extremely hard even to ap-
proach. Tokuhata and Lilien-
feld approached it through 361
lung cancer patients of the
Roswell Park Memorial Insti-
tute, Buffalo, N. Y.
Each one they "matched"
with two persons who were
patients in the same hospit'ali
for reasons other than cancer.
"Matching" meant these "con;
trols" were of the same age.
sex, race'and type of commu-
nity of residence as the lung
cancer patients.
Then the scientists exhaus-
tively checked the vitall statis-
tics of blood relatives of cancer
patients and' "controls"-broth,
ers, sisters, parents. They were
looking for the relatives who
had died of lung cancer.
• Classed 'Significant'
More relatives of, lung can
cer patients had,so died than
relatives of "controls." The
preponderance, by the refined'
statistical calculations upon
which science depends for
many answers,, was classed as
"significant."

Killed 20%, Of Nuns
Who Died This Year ~
~
NEW ORLEANS-(NC)-Fifty-one of 251 nurns
who have died thus far in 1963 died of cancer, ac-
cording to a preliminary report issued here on the
„cause of death of nuns.
The r e p o r t was released.
(April' 11 ) by Dr. James T. Nix,
chairman of the Committee on
Medical Care of Clergy and Re-
ligious of the Nationali Federa-
tion of Catholic Physicians'
Guilds and the Catholic Hos-
.pital Association. The commit-
tee is conducting an investiga-
tion into the cause of death of
all nuns in the U.S. during 1963.
The report states that'only 12
of the nuns who died were under
50 years old at the time of
death, andI the average age at
death of the nuns was 75 years.
IN ANOTHER REPORT, the
committee says that "primary
carcinoma (cancer) of the lung
is less fi•equent in nuns than in
the general population."
This finding, the reportstates,
is based on a "pilot project
undertaken to estimate the f'
tinues, "by reviewing admis-
sions to 500 Catholic general
hospitals from an estitt,ated
population of 100,000 nuns over
a 10-year period,

years in 25 af the 33 cases. The

the past decade, and the rising curve

described as "symptomatic of an epi-

England and Wales, there is patho-

increase started at least forty years

Japan, it has been observed only dur-

the stomach cancer rate is sink-

, Yhe six years ended in 1959.
These geographical peculiari-
ties were explored here today
in an effort to uncover clues
to the causes of cancer. The
occasion was a symposium spon-
sored by the National Cancer
Institute of the United States,
the Anna Fuller Fund and the
American Association for Can-
cer Research, whose annual
meeting is being held here.
In additioni further results
were presented froni a long-
term~ study of, the effect of
smoking, on British physicians.
The speaker was Dr. Richard
Doll, who heads the statisticali
research unit of Britain's Medi-
cal Research Council.
The British study, which be-
gan in 1951, covers 40,000 phy-
sicians, who have been classed
according to their smoking
habits. A reeent' analysis of the
141icigarette - smoking parti-
cipants who have already died
of' lung cancer showed, Dr. Doil,
said, a striking relationship be-
tween the death rate, for any
one age group, and the number
of cigarettes smoked a day.
Cumulative Effect Cited
Dr. Doll also told of new
evidence that cancer often ra-
sults from the cumulative er-
fects of several insults to the
body. He cited a recent' survey
of cancers produced by various
industrial chemicals.
It' has been found, he said,
that the later in life exposure
to such chemicals begins the
sooner is cancer likely to ap-
pear. The itnplication+ he be-
lieves, is that, over the years,
man is confronted with a multi-
tude of noxious substances that
progressively increases his sys-
ceptibillty to cancer.
It has not yet been deter-
mined, he said, whether this
applies to cigarette smoking. As
a possible example of a two-
step process, he cited a report
on the geography of liver can-
cer Dresented to the symposium
and raised there. The implica=
tion
he said
was that those
,
,
,_
who emigrated from China ' in
childhood had • •experienced'~qy
something that ; predisposed i
them to the disease.
Malnutrition In Children
The condition found in cb11- ;`
dren through much of the r
gion where liver cancer Is ¢om- ~-'
mon„ he said, is kwashiorkor, a~lf
form of malnutrition resulting .;;`
from lack of protein. The cancer that, in lropieal '
Africa, tends to attack the jaw-
bones of children is malignant
lymphoma. It is so rare in the ;;f
Americas and Europe that
during the last 30 years the _~
great cancer center at Memorial ,
Hospitall, in New York, h3s seen

D.r Gregory T. O'Conor of ';
the National Cancer Institute ~ `
told of speculation that the die- ;..
ease was caused in Africa by a,
virus carried on insects or para-
sites. This, however, seems in- ,
consistent', he said, with the
occurence of the disease else-
where, where, even though rarely.
He suggested, instead, that.
some sort of infestations '
weaken resistance to cancer. ,
There has been little or no in-; '
.
vestigation, he said, of the
subtle diseases that may affect '
the mouths of young Africans. '
The paucity of breast cancer in '
Japan was described by.Dr. A. "

habits. A reeent' analysis of the
141icigarette - smoking parti-
cipants who have already died
of' lung cancer showed, Dr. Doil,
said, a striking relationship be-
tween the death rate, for any
one age group, and the number
of cigarettes smoked a day.
Cumulative Effect Cited
Dr. Doll also told of new
evidence that cancer often ra-
sults from the cumulative er-
fects of several insults to the
body. He cited a recent' survey
of cancers produced by various
industrial chemicals.
It' has been found, he said,
that the later in life exposure
to such chemicals begins the
sooner is cancer likely to ap-
pear. The itnplication+ he be-
lieves, is that, over the years,
man is confronted with a multi-
tude of noxious substances that
progressively increases his sys-
ceptibillty to cancer.
It has not yet been deter-
mined, he said, whether this
applies to cigarette smoking. As
a possible example of a two-
step process, he cited a report
on the geography of liver can-
cer Dresented to the symposium
and raised there. The implica=
tion
he said
was that those
,
,
,_
who emigrated from China ' in
childhood had • •experienced'~qy
something that ; predisposed i
them to the disease.
Malnutrition In Children
The condition found in cb11- ;`
dren through much of the r
gion where liver cancer Is ¢om- ~-'
mon„ he said, is kwashiorkor, a~lf
form of malnutrition resulting .;;`
from lack of protein. The cancer that, in lropieal '
Africa, tends to attack the jaw-
bones of children is malignant
lymphoma. It is so rare in the ;;f
Americas and Europe that
during the last 30 years the _~
great cancer center at Memorial ,
Hospitall, in New York, h3s seen

D.r Gregory T. O'Conor of ';

told of speculation that the die- ;..
ease was caused in Africa by a,
virus carried on insects or para-
sites. This, however, seems in- ,
consistent', he said, with the
occurence of the disease else-
where, where, even though rarely.
He suggested, instead, that.
some sort of infestations '

This will inevitably delay

evidence and the second is to
advise whether the Govern-

of smoking. ~
The Public Health Service has
already said that the weight
of evidence indicates a link be-

cer. But this statement has
had little impact on cigarette

'' Fpr the first time, Cana-
dian medicine has dropped
its professional reticence with
the public to speak plainly
•o; e.."lr.ebout its views on the dan-
gers " gers of cigarettes.
Gist of the message: stop
"smoking and lengthen your
life-continue at your peril.
The medical profession is
armed with a host of facts
it says indicate the more
-a per~on smokes (especially
°, cigarettes), the more likely
he or she is going to get can-
cer of the lung, a heart at-
tack or some other disease.
Inspiring the attack on
smoking is the recognition.
that deaths from lung can-
cer are rising at an alarming
rate, and now total 2,500
.. , _ F+•.-. men and' 400 women per year.
So is the incidence of
deaths from arterio-sclerotic
and degenerative heart dis-
ease. The link: death rate is
• markedly higher for smokers
; `than for non-smokers.
Cigarette smoking's factor
in the country's mortality
.:: rate, they say, is wriiten so
clearly that physicians are
stepping up their attack not
sk-aply or. smoking but Also
on thintis which influence
people to smoke.
Physicians are condemning
cigarette advertising for its
seduction of the innocent-
for its aim to capture the af-
fectiuns of. teen-age (and
even younger) children.
Next step in~ the battle may
be legal. Medico-lay health
gt oups may urge the federal
government to enforce the
recent, but ignored, Tobacco
Restraint Act.
This act, passed in 1952,,
makes it illegal for anyone
under 16 to smoke, buy or
possess tobacco.
~' The . act also `sayS'`people
who sell cigarettes must be
sure they are not sold to chil-
dren.
Enforcement of this pro-
.vision would cause all ciga-
rette vending machines to be
withdrawn across Canada --
perhaps half of the country's
30,000-plus vending machines
sell t o b a c c o, representing
sales over $30 million per
.year. .
Says the current president
of the Canadian Medical As-
sociation, Dr. M. R. Mac-
Charles:
."Our aim must be to reach
the young peopie: Each day
it is estimated 450 boys and
girls aged 11-17 start smok-
ing, and once children start
it only takes two years for
the habit to get a hold."'
? He was almost as blunt in
a message to CMA members
in March:
"I would like to suggest to
those physicians who feel un-
able to discontinue the smok-
ing 'of cigarettes that' an ap-
propriate p u b 11 c example
could be provided by ab-
staining when in the exercise
of their professional duties."
Why are the physicians
seeking battle with the 'de-
mon' tobacco?
First, studies in many
countries of lung-cancer pa-
tients, and patients with dis-
eases of the respiratory sys-
tem or heart, show that
smoking addicts suffer from
' these much more frequently
f than non-smokers.
Second, the number 'and
incidence of deaths from lung
cancer alorie'is rising rapidly.
Betwcen 1940 and -1960, the
maie population of Canada al-
most doubled, yet the num-
ber of deaths from lung can-
cer increased about eight
times, to 2,223.
"It is the hTo

.
nce
n
men and it is the only pre-
ventable cancer," says Dr.
J. O. Godden, an associate
editor of the CMA Journal
and secretary of the CMA
Committee on Cancer.
"This is the only cancer
that a fellow gives himself,
and pays about $260 year for
the privilege. It is self-in-
duced-and what makes It
more horrible is that young
people are being taught to
produce it in themselves." ;
. Said the CMA Journal last
.year of cigarette advertising:
"The campaign to seduce
the young and to recruit them
into the ranks of regular
`smokers (with the consequent
curtailment of life expectan-
cy for at least 10 ;~0~159'0 of
those who succumb) Is vir-
tually unopposed in this
country.
"This seduction, aptly de-
scribed as the process of psy-
chological addiction, and -the
a c ti v e recruiting, depend
principally upon the example
of adult smokers and the un-

Nearing ~• Epidemic,

Says Science Pair
By Nate Haseltine
Btatf Reporter
The United States, as well
as a number of other coun-
tries, Is int he throes of a lung.
•cancer epidemic, and the
major cause is excessive ciga,
rette smoking. -
This is the conclusion of a
husband-w i f e, prizewinning
-pair of science writers after
appraising the evidences avail+
able in collaboration with
cditors. of Consumer Reports
and other authorities.
"There is reason to believe
the worst is yet to come," con-
eluded Edward and Ruth
Brecher, In their compre-
hensive report entitled "Smok-
ing and Lung Cancer" in the
June issue of Consumer Re-
ports. This is the monthly
advisory -publication of Con-
sumers' Union of' the United
States, nonprofit organization
which advises consumers on
the merits of products.
Statistics Cited "'
The Brechers cited a statis-
t i e a 1 presentation of the
American Public Health As-
sociation to show that "if
;. present trends continue, lung
cancer will claim the lives
of more than 1 million pres-
-ent school children ih this
country before they reach the
age of 70 years.".
-.- The special report, admit-
tedly, contains no ne:, in-
formation. It analyzes the
cumulative evidences against
--.-cigarette smoking tu s h o w
"there is no remaining room
for reasonable doubt" that
cigarette smoking does cause
lung cancer.
Discussing autopsy records,
dcath certificates and the ap-
parent invulnerability of non-
smoking Seventh Day Advent-
ists to lung cancer, the authors
concluded:
"We are living in the midst
of a major lung cancer epi-
demic.This epidemic hits men
first and hardest, but has af-
fected women as well. It is
o c c u r r i a g not only in the
United States but in a number
of other countries.

habits and lung cancer as had;
already been shown in many
linked with heavy, prolonged

said. "But no such popula-
tion has been reported." •

epidemic wave, the authors i
said the increase in lung can,•
cer in men has been evenl~
steepcr (than in the United
:States) in Scotland, England,
Wales and some other coun-
tries.
They said almost every
study made on the contro•
versial subject can be subject
Ito attack, due to qualifications
and limitations. But putting
them all together, they said,
they found a wall of evidence
against cigarette smoking.
The science writers offered
solace, however, to Inveterate
cigarette smokers who say
they can't or don't want to
kick the habit:
"Even among those who
smoke two packs or more a
day frotiv boyhood to old age,
8 or 9 out of 10 will die of
something else," they wrote.
They left open the fact that
*some of that "something else"
may be deaths attributable to
other effects of cigarette
smoking. A preface to the 1:r

CQURIER ElGJ'RESS
Buffalo, New York
. April 19, 1963
By JER.itY T. BAULCH
WASffiNGTON M-The tobacco
industry made anew, strong plea'
Thursday for scientists not to ac-
cept as conclusive reports that
cigarette smoking causes lung
; ; cancer.
. Research last year made it in-
rreasingly evident that' many con-
stitutional and environmental fac-
tors play a role in who gets cahcer
or heart disease, said Dr. Clar-
ence Cook Little, scientific direc-
tor of the Tobacco Industry Re-
search Committee.
aIt Is at present scientifically '
unwise and indeed may be
16armful to attribute a simple
definitive causative role to any
one of them, or to attempt to
assign them relative degrees of
importance;' Little's annual re-
• port said.
His committee was formed in
1954.and has been dealing main-
'ly with the much-debated question
of whether cigarette smoking
causes lung cancer, which some
reports have answered with a
qualified "yes."'on this point, Lit-
tle said:
"The smoking of tobacco con-
Unues to be one of the subjects
requiring study in the lung cancer
problem, as do many other agents
.and influences In modern living.
Link Not Positive
"Sci2nce does not yet know
enough about any suspected fac-
tors to judge whether they may
operate alone, whether they may
operate in conjunction with others.
or whether they may affect or be
affected by factors of whose
existence science Is not yet aware.
Indeed, it Is not' known whether
the factors actually are "causa-
tive' in any real sense."
Little said research studies
have increased factual knowledge
about lung cancer, heart' disease
and other ailments, but he addedc
"There have been and will con-
tinue to be speculation and opin-
ions on the causes, but it is a mat-
ter of scientific fact that, In our
present state of knowledge, no one
knows the answer."
Scientific work in 1962, he
continued, "continued to support
the view that the quest for a
single, simple 'magic bullet' -to
e:plain the causes or provide
the cure for cancer and of heart'
disease is unrealistic and prob-
ably futiie: •
Gaps in knowledge stem in
large degree, Little said. from a
lack of adequate and controlled
methods of studying under dif-
ferent physical, physiological and
mental environments.
One obstacle to accurate re-
search, Little said, is "the unques-
tioning, unreserved endorsement,
as conclusive" of repetitive re-
ports which contain no new
original data but amount to a
statement of opinion.

text of the Reference Committee report is as follows Lunofficial text):

"Your Reference Committee considered Supplementary Report 0 together with

Resolutions 24 and 45 dealing with tobacco and disease. Your Committee

heard considerable testimony. Your Reference Committee recognizes the
deleterious effects on health of many toxic substances to which people of

"The Study Committee, which is currently reviewing the subject, includes many

The Supplementary Report 0 is a`statement adopted by the A.M.A. Board of Trustees

': May 15, adopted a resolution on the "dangers of cigarette smoking."
and chairman of its convention committee, was adopted. However,: Society
drafted by Dr. Bernard J. Pisani, director of the Society's scientific program
Four such resolutions had been proposed. The least stringent of the four, that
spokesmen say the four were combined.
,. -
The text of the resolution is as follows:
"WHEREAS, The preponderance of the
smoking is implicated in the genesis of lung
cardiovascular, and is detrimental to health


evidence indicates that cigaret

in other fields; and ,
"VHF.REAS_ The Medical Society of the State of New York is concerned

record as advocat'ing the voluntary giving up of cigarets by those already
"Resolved, That the Medical Society of the State of New York recommend
,'that physicians advise regarding the dangers of heavy cigaret smoking in their
'.heaLth counseling and community educational endeavors, particularly among the
; teen-age group." I
The resolution that was adopted differed significantly 'from those proposed by
on smoking.
resolution actually adopted recommends that physicians advise their own patients
an educational program to persuade young people not to smoke. However, the
other resolutions called on the State Medical Society to initiate and maintain

2. At its annual meeting, The Medical Association of Georgia on Wedn:sday,
May 8, at Jekyll Island, Georgia, rejected a resolution saying that the
preponderance of evidence indicates that cigarette smoking is implicated in
the genesis of lung cancer.
The resolution was defeated in the House of Delegates of the Association by a
vote of 66 to 27. During the debate, opponents charged the resolution was a
personal infringement and that it would "make us look silly when we get home."
The Georgia resolution called for an Association educational program designed to
discourage young people from smoking. It also would have instructed delegates
of the Georgia Association to present their resolution to the American Medical'
Association House of Delegates at its next meeting.

help find new ways to stop those
that are already smoking regu-

starting and encourage not regu-

has said, "Qver the years, we
have found the old approach ot
moralizing against smoking hasn"

worked. Now that we kottw thr

county we can begin to pinpoin
new approaches." He added, "S•
far, we have had some wild idea
on how to cut down.cn teen•ag

them out because who can sa
they don't work, especially sint
we cannot point to anything th.
has worked successfully."

COLLEGE SMOKING
School-Health Directors Urged
to Give Out Information
on Tobacco.


Young people should be in•
formed of the effects of tobacco
but prohibiting them from smok-
iag Is not the answer, college
and' university health service di-
rectors were told here yesterday
afternoon.
Dr. Roger S: Mitchell, di-
rector of the Webb-Waring In-
stitute for Medical Research,
Denver, and associate profes-
'sor of medicine at the Universi-
ty of Colbrado school of medi-
cine, spoke at the closing ses-
sion of the American College
:'Health association convention
at the Hotel Muehlebach.
Young people are more intel,
ligent than they are credited-.
with being, he said, and if giv-
en the facts they will make the
wise decision.
A Panel Talk.
After his talk, Mitchell took
part in a panel discussion on
college smoking. The other
panelists were Dr. Harold S.
Diehl, New York, senior vice-
president for research and
medical affairs of the American
Cancer society, and Dr. Doug-.
lass S. Thompson, health serv-
ice director, of the University
of Pittsburgh. ~ht~5
Dr. Mitchell said lnng cancer,
chronic bronchitis and emphy-
sema killed 100,000 Americans
a y6ar. He said It had been
proved that they were related
to smoking and he said the In-
crease in the frequency of
these diseases paralleled the
rising use of cigarettes since
the turn of the century.
Smoking has increased in a11
groups except doctors, Dr.
Mitchell said. He said 95 per ''-:j
cent of the doctors believed
smoking was harmful, yet.
medical societies had not taken
a•stand"on the issue. This would ,
'be an important factor in in- ,
iluencing young people not to
begin smoking, he said.
As a Habit.


He said smoking was an ad-
diction that shortens life. He
said only 15 per cent of chronic
lung patients were persuaded
to quit.
Dr. Diehl said the most im-
portant thing college health
service directors could do te
discourage campus smoking
was to change the current Im-
age of the smoker as the most
popular student. He said the
directors should give the sta-
dents the facts about smoking
to counteract misleading ad,
vertising.
Dr. Diehl suggested that in-
stitutions refuse to profit from
the sale of cigarettes.
Dr. Thompson said lung can-
cer warning signs were placed
near cigarette vending ma-
chines at the University of
Pittsburgh, and it resulted in a
7 per cent decrease in sales.
He added that a college health
officer pays a certain price for
carrying out such a campaign
on the campus which could af-
fect his role as a physician.

THERE is little question today but that millions of
adult Americans who have been "hooked" by the

- cigaret habit will solidly applaud the action of the
Florida Medical Assn. this past Sunday in urging the
formation of a nationwide program designed to in-
fluence young people not to start smoking. _
:; These doctors know well enough that there isn't

much point to urging heavy smokers who have been
; at it a long time to give up the habit in the interest of

their own health and well being. Millions of smokers

may want to "kick" the habit, but it's a most difficult
thing to do and for every smoker who quits there are
hundreds who try and who faill simply because they
just can't overcome their own desires. .. •
That's why any campaign aimed at driving home
the dangers inherent in this habit must be aimed at
those who haven't started it yet, or who haven't been
at it long enough for it to become fully established.

These are our young people In high school and in
college, a million of whom it is currently estimated
will be doomed to die of lung cancer if the present

trend is continued.
; As the FMA was told by a leading chest surgeon
last week, "one hitndred per cent of well-controlled
studies have shown there is a direct connectinn be-
tween cigaret smoking and cancer. -
"In my 20 years as a chest surgeon," this doctor
declared, "most of the death certificates I have signed
e were due to conditions which were either caused or
aggravated by smoking.".
CIGARET compaoies, of course, are prone to chal-
tenge any findings which relate the rising incidence
of lung cancer and other diseases like chronic bron-
chitis and emphysema to sinoking. Yet, more and
more doctors and medical _authorities have now be-
come completely convinced that heavy smoking over
an extended period of time is definitely conducive to
the development of cancer and other lung. diseases
and they think it is time that America's young people
are more thoroughly indoctrinated into the dangers of
smokinc.
We are in complete agreement with these doctors
and medical authorities on this point and we think


every person who has pickd up the smoking habit

will concur that it is far easier not to start smoking
than to give it' up once it has become an established
habit
.
:. ,..


Smoking, of course, Isn't a habit that is peculiar ''
to America or Americans. It Is world wide In its ':
-•- `scope and has now become so engrained In so many
people that there is virtually no hope of eliminating it.
Yet wttile there may be little hope of Inducing con "~
,-


~ firmed 'srnokers to give up the habit, there is increas-`'.
'
Ing hope that an intelligent and inforinative campaign

aimed at inducing the younger generation not to be- A1
gin smoking can do a lot of, good and save a lot of •:.
lives and that's the kind of campaign the.FMA would

like to get started in this country.

= Such a campaigri has already been launched in '"°i
' England over the objections of the tobacco industrY'`rl
, :~.
and has already produced billboards and other de '.-
vices geared to the objective of informing young peo-•~'```~
; pie about the dangers inherent in adoption of the

smoking habit.
. . .. .,. . ~ .
rta'~ f, ~ Y.•h~7 11•IT"f,:
WHAT is now being done in,England is what the. FMA would like to see started in this country,'"",
t
and one of the objectives of the FMA is to try to get µi-4
. the American Medical Assn. at Its mid-June conven-.;
tion in Atlantic City to adopt the same resolution the

"`
Florida group adopted Sunday.


There will be some who will say doctors, many "
of whom smoke,"have no business speaking out on this .'w
controversial subject. But if the medical profession ;~
isn't to speak out' who is going to do it? And what
group has more cause to speak out than those who .~,
are faced with the responsibility of treating men and k~
women who have incurred lung cancer, bronchitis or ~~
some other disability presumably brought on or ag-'
gravatea by smoking,
As the FMA resolution declares:
"The preponderance of e•vidence indicates that cigaret smol.
Ing is strongly implicated in the genesis of lung cancer, chronir
bronchitis and emphysema." Q
If this be so then the medical profession not' only has a riD1lt ~
but a duty to inform the American people about what e:ees-i~t~
smoking many do to their health. •
It is too late, of course, to stop the rising incidence of
lung cancer among long-time, •heavy smokers in the older.
:_
groups. Rut, certainly, it isn't too late to indoctrinate our youn,!cr
people into what they may be letting themselves in for by pick:u,
up the smoking habit and encouraging them not to adopt it:
We know of :ery few smokers who would not like to q:ut :r
they could. We know very few, also, who would encourage a:.i+•
one to start; as once started it is a mighty tough habit to drop.
-Doctors know this better than anyone else and that is why wc.
are happy to see the Florida Medical Assn. getting behind a pro,
gram to alert our young people to what they feel are the health
dangers inherent in smoking.

THE TIMES
London, England
June 7, 1963
RULING AGAINST
TOBACCO FIRM
FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT
NEW YORK, JUNS 6
Prices of tobacco stocks fell, u11
sharply in heavy selling of' those shar,.,
this morning on the New York Stock
Exchange, The selling was in reflec-
' tipn of a ruling yesterday by the FI'orida
Supreme Court that under Florida lawy
cigarette manufacturers and their dis-
t~butors. were liable for any harmful
effects of their products on the hum:, n
body, whether or not " by htlrnan sk ill '
and foresight " they could' have fore-
seen such effects. '
The ruling, by the state's highest court.
was made in response to a request from
a federal Court of Appeals which had
granted a rehearing of a. suit for
$250,000 (about f89,300) against the
American Tobacco Company, manu-
facturers of Lucky Strike cigarettes, by
the widow of Edwin Grpen, of' Miami.
Mrs. Green contended that the illness
of her husband'and his death in 1958
from lung cancer had resulted from his
smoking Lucky Strike. . The federal
district court in which the suit was first
tried rtiled that the tobacco compan;v
was not liable, as it could not reason-
ably be determined whether smnking
was endangering Mr. Green's health.
ABSOLUTE LIABILITY
This was the decision also of the
Court of Appealk. Both courts„however,, held that the cigarettes had been th:
cause of his cancer.
In its advisory ruling yesterday the
rtate Supreme Court said that Florida
low imposed on the manufacturer and
distributor of: the cigarettes absolute
liability for breach of the " implied
warrantee " that such items are pre-
sumed fit for human consumption, even
though the manufacturer cri.lid not have
known a user would be in danger of
contrscting lung cancer;

Sm~king Assailed
As caneer Cause
By MARLYN AYCOCR
Cigarette smoking was termed'
yesterday the most important
cause 'of lung cancer among
humans.
The charge was made by Dr..
Oscar Auerbach, professor of
pathology at New York Medi-
cal College, New York, at the
23d national meeting of the
Association of Clinical Scien-
tists at the Pendennis Club.,
Auerbach reported on a
study begun eight xears ago
in his alternate capacity as
senior medical investigator at
the Veterans Hospital at East
Orange, N. J.
"For the last six years I've
never seen a case of' lung can-
cer in man, of the types gen-
erally known, that had not been
the result of cigarette amok-
•ing," he said.
The study, financed the past
I 0d35A 30 ~ 7
seven years on a grant fro n
the American Cancer Society,
Is not complet'ed, But Auerbach
said he learned enough after
one year to give up smok-
ing.
The study specimens are au-•
topsy findings at the Veterans
Hospital and 11 other hospitals.
Various groupings were made
for comparisons, such as non-
smokers, former smokers, and
persons who smoked until their
deaths.
Each study group was
.matched as closely as possible
by age' groups, the locality
from which the person came,
and occupations.
Auerbach said the study waa
begun to answer these quas,
tions:
1. Were there changes in thee
bronchial-tube tissues of per-
sons who died of lung cancer
which could be considered' pre-
liminary stages of lu ng cancer?
2. If so, were those same
changes found in persons who
died of causes other than lung
cancer?
Auerbach said 208 slides
were made of each specimen,
or more than 100;000 total'
slides. They were 'divided into
three separate sudies.
VIRGINIAti PILdT

The answers, in. all three
studies, were yes to the first
question and no to the second,
he said.
Auerbach said ihe slides
atso showed:
1. There were more cases of
early cancerous changes in men
smokers t h a n among women.
Auerbach s.:id 11he reasons

But when just the women
were considered, changes were
found among smokers that did
not occur in nonsmokers, just
as with the men, Auerbach
said. . :~? - . . .
2. There were few " tissue
changes in nonsmokers, even
in subjects 30 years apart in•
. age. Among personss w h o
smoked, there was a Significant
increase in the changes of the
older persons.
3. Men who smoked pipes or
cigars showed far fewer tissue
changes than cigarette smok-

-00EEK WAYS TO CURB
COLLEGE SMOKING
School-Health Directors Urged
to Give Out Information
on Tobacco.


Young people should be in•
formed of the effects of tobacco
but prohibiting them from smok-
iag Is not the answer, college
and' university health service di-
rectors were told here yesterday
afternoon.
Dr. Roger S: Mitchell, di-
rector of the Webb-Waring In-
stitute for Medical Research,
Denver, and associate profes-
'sor of medicine at the Universi-
ty of Colbrado school of medi-
cine, spoke at the closing ses-
sion of the American College
:'Health association convention
at the Hotel Muehlebach.
Young people are more intel,
ligent than they are credited-.
with being, he said, and if giv-
en the facts they will make the
wise decision.
A Panel Talk.
After his talk, Mitchell took
part in a panel discussion on
college smoking. The other
panelists were Dr. Harold S.
Diehl, New York, senior vice-
president for research and
medical affairs of the American
Cancer society, and Dr. Doug-.
lass S. Thompson, health serv-
ice director, of the University
of Pittsburgh. ~ht~5
Dr. Mitchell said lnng cancer,
chronic bronchitis and emphy-
sema killed 100,000 Americans
a y6ar. He said It had been
proved that they were related
to smoking and he said the In-
crease in the frequency of
these diseases paralleled the
rising use of cigarettes since
the turn of the century.
Smoking has increased in a11
groups except doctors, Dr.
Mitchell said. He said 95 per ''-:j
cent of the doctors believed
smoking was harmful, yet.
medical societies had not taken
a•stand"on the issue. This would ,
'be an important factor in in- ,
iluencing young people not to
begin smoking, he said.
As a Habit.


He said smoking was an ad-
diction that shortens life. He
said only 15 per cent of chronic
lung patients were persuaded
to quit.
Dr. Diehl said the most im-
portant thing college health
service directors could do te
discourage campus smoking
was to change the current Im-
age of the smoker as the most
popular student. He said the
directors should give the sta-
dents the facts about smoking
to counteract misleading ad,
vertising.
Dr. Diehl suggested that in-
stitutions refuse to profit from
the sale of cigarettes.
Dr. Thompson said lung can-
cer warning signs were placed
near cigarette vending ma-
chines at the University of
Pittsburgh, and it resulted in a
7 per cent decrease in sales.
He added that a college health
officer pays a certain price for
carrying out such a campaign
on the campus which could af-
fect his role as a physician.

Sm~king Assailed
As caneer Cause
By MARLYN AYCOCR
Cigarette smoking was termed'
yesterday the most important
cause 'of lung cancer among
humans.
The charge was made by Dr..
Oscar Auerbach, professor of
pathology at New York Medi-
cal College, New York, at the
23d national meeting of the
Association of Clinical Scien-
tists at the Pendennis Club.,
Auerbach reported on a
study begun eight xears ago
in his alternate capacity as
senior medical investigator at
the Veterans Hospital at East
Orange, N. J.
"For the last six years I've
never seen a case of' lung can-
cer in man, of the types gen-
erally known, that had not been
the result of cigarette amok-
•ing," he said.
The study, financed the past
I 0d35A 30 ~ 7
seven years on a grant fro n
the American Cancer Society,
Is not complet'ed, But Auerbach
said he learned enough after
one year to give up smok-
ing.
The study specimens are au-•
topsy findings at the Veterans
Hospital and 11 other hospitals.
Various groupings were made
for comparisons, such as non-
smokers, former smokers, and
persons who smoked until their
deaths.
Each study group was
.matched as closely as possible
by age' groups, the locality
from which the person came,
and occupations.
Auerbach said the study waa
begun to answer these quas,
tions:
1. Were there changes in thee
bronchial-tube tissues of per-
sons who died of lung cancer
which could be considered' pre-
liminary stages of lu ng cancer?
2. If so, were those same
changes found in persons who
died of causes other than lung
cancer?
Auerbach said 208 slides
were made of each specimen,
or more than 100;000 total'
slides. They were 'divided into
three separate sudies.
VIRGINIAti PILdT
Norfolk, Virginia
April 20, 1963
The answers, in. all three
studies, were yes to the first
question and no to the second,
he said.
Auerbach said ihe slides
atso showed:
1. There were more cases of
early cancerous changes in men
smokers t h a n among women.

But when just the women
were considered, changes were
found among smokers that did
not occur in nonsmokers, just
as with the men, Auerbach
said. . :~? - . . .
2. There were few " tissue
changes in nonsmokers, even
in subjects 30 years apart in•

smoked, there was a Significant
increase in the changes of the
older persons.
3. Men who smoked pipes or
cigars showed far fewer tissue
changes than cigarette smok-
ers. Auerbach termed this one
of the most significant findings
but said he didn't know why
there was such a difference.
"It may be that pipe 'and
cigar smokerrs' inhale less." he
said, "or it may be something

A plea for .teenagers not to
*start smoking and repeated state-

cuts years and "pleasure" from

Institute on Smoking and Health
at Oregon State University.
' Young smokers (those who start

°They wind up smoking more.

And as the years go by, chances
for a premature death are five
times as great • for those who
started smoking in their teeas,
compared to non-smokers of the

Three other national medical
leaders agreed that "there is no
doubt whatever anymore" that

big villain - cause cancer, heart
and lung diseases, 'and various
other aihnents.
Dr. Hammond said most smo¢-
ers give "pleasure" as their rea-
.7m for smoking. These pleasures
end up being a persistent cough,
shortness of breath and loss of
appetite. Athletes and students do
not perform as well' whed' they
smoke either.
"This," Dr. Hammond said, "is
a funny idea of pleasure."

The National Congress of
Parents and Teachers yester-
day challenged what one of-
ficial called the "smokewash-
ing" of teen - agers by
glamorized tobacco advertis-
ing.
The congress, in its annual
convention here, voted to step
up its efforts against teen-
aged smoking, and to invite
representatives of the tobacco
and advertising industries to
an exchange of views on ad-
vertising techniques.
Mrs. Clifford N. Jenkins,
president of the 12 million
member congress, said Invi-
tations would be sent out for
a meeting at the congress
headquarters in Chicago in
carly fall. Business represen-
tatives -of the press, radio,
television and magazines also
will be invited.
"We are certain the invl-.
tations will be accepted," Mrs.•
Jenkins said. ,
The resolution calling sor
the action was approved over-
whelmingly by the estimated
1,000 voting delegates. It orig-
inated with separate resolu-
tions proposed by PTAs in
Utah and'
Columbia.
the District of
Eva H. Grant, editor of the
PTA magazine, said after the
vote: "The smoke that pours
from the mouths of televi,
sion announcers is getting
into the minds as well as the
eyes of the children. Ameri'-
caii teen-agers are being
smokewashed."
Several delegates said pri-
vately it was futile for the.
PTA to challenge forces as
powerful as Madison Avenue
and the tobacco industry.
4ne, who requested anony-
mity, said: "This will, only un-
derscore the public image of
the PTA as a completely im-
practical organization titling
at windmills."
. Mrs. Jenkins, however, said
there was ample pr€cedent
for the action. A national
boycott by PTA members in
1956, she said, forced comiE;
book publishers to "clean up"
their publications. A meeting
with representatives of the
liquor industry at' about the
same time was instrumental
in keeping advertisements for
hard liquor off radio and
television.
Similar meetings also had
been held with representa-
tives of the movie Industry in
an attempt to curb what PTA
officials have called "the out-
rageously lurid" advertising
of films.
The nation:l organization,
representing 47,000 local units,
has had no official policy on
teen-age smoking. Hovrever,

campaigned againFt i`.

(AP)-The National Congress
of Parents and Teachers chal-
lenged today what ore official
called the ' smoke-washing" of
teen-agers by glamorized tobac-
co advertising.
The congress, In its annual
convention here„ voted to step
up its efforts against teen-age
smoking, and to invite rer,re-
sentatives of the tobacco at nd
advertising industries to an ex-
change of views on advertising

Mrs. Clifford N. Jenkins,
president of the 12,000,000-mem-
ber groups, said that invitations
would be sent out for a meet-
ing at the organization's head-
quarters in Chicago in early
fall. Business representatives of
the press, radio, television and
magazines will also be invited.
The resolution calling for the
action was adopted overwhelm-
ingly by the 1,000 voting dele,
gates. It originated with sep-
arate resolutions proposed by
Parent-Teacher groups in Utah
and the District of Columl}ia.
e Eva H. Grant, editor of The
PTA Magazine, said after the
vote:
"The smoke that pours from
the mouths of television an.
nouncers is getting into the

the children. American teen-
agers are being smoke-washed."
Several delegates said private
ly it was futile for the group
challenge forces as powerful as
Madison Avenue and the tobac
industry.
One said that "this will onlyy
underscore the public image of
the P.T.A. as a,.compietely im-
practicai organization tilting at'
windmills,"
Mrs,i-7enkins, however, said
there was ample precedent for
the action.
A national boycott by the
organization's members in 1956,
she said, forced comic book pub-
lishers to "clean up"' their pub-
lication. A meeting with rep-
resentatives of the liquor in-

was inst'rumental in keeping ad-
vertisements for hard liquor off

Company - .
Held Liable I n7obacco Canc~ r Case
TAI3,AHASSEE, F'la., June 61 The district eourt at Miami
(AP) .-The Florida Bupre me
Court has ruled that cigarette
manufacturers, may be held
liable for the harmful, effects
.of their products on the human
body. I •
In an advisory opinion writ-
ten for the United States 5th
Circuit Court of Appeals at
New Orleans, the Florida, court
said It was not essential in
such cases for the manufac-
turer to be aware of the harm-
ful effects of his products to
be held liable for damages.
The advisory opinion was
asked in a suit brought by the
late Edwin Green of Miami in
1957 against the American
Tobacco Co. Mr. Green charged
that he became afflicted with
lung cancer as a result of
amoking Lucky Strike ciga-
found that the company was
not liable for the effects of
Its products on the human
body since the manufacturer
could not "by human skill and
foresight" have known of any
danger.
Meanwhile, tobacco company
stock prices showed a drop
today in response to the
Florida decision. '
Mr. Green died February 25.
1958: His widow Mary and
son. Edwin Green, Jr., ap-
pealed the decision.
The appellate court then
granted a rehearing of the
case and requested an advisory
opinion of the Florida Su-
preme Court under a novel
provision of Florida law which
permits such opinions to be
rendered by Federal courts.
The opinion states that

NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE
New York, New York
June 7, 1963.
Nonsense
It's silly season on the cigarette
front again. 'I31e Florida Supreme
Court has just held that, under
Florida law, a cigarette manufacturer
can be held liable for a death due to
Jung cancer.
,,:;;
This makes about as much sense as
allowing a damage suit against the
distiller when an alcoholic drinks
himself to death. Or letting a driver
sue General Motors when he piles his
car into a tree.
* In another case last November, a
Federal court jury. in Pittsburgh ab-
iolved Liggett &amp; Myers of responsi-
bility In a lung cancer case, on the
perfectly reasonable premise that the
plaintiff, by smoking, had assumed
the risk of injury.
.. But now the Florida court says
ithere can be no valid objection to
placing liability on the manufacturer
manufacturer and distributor
of the cigarettes absolute lin-
bllitY for breach of "impiiPd
warranty" in the death of Mr
Green even though 4he manu-
facturer could not have known '
that users would be in danger
of contracting lung cancer.
The Florida court said it as- :
sumed from the Jury'a response
in the trial of the case that
the American Tobacco Com-,
pany'e cigarettes caused Mr.!
Green'a fatal lung cance=.
The court said it could not'
agree that prevailing indust'ry
standards should supplant or-~
dinary requirements of objec-,
tivity and truth in the market-
ing of a product.
This, the court said, would
be shifting the burden from
the seller to the buyer forf the
risk of whatever latent defec-
tiveness may ultimately be
proved,
There can be no valid ob-
iection to indust'ry assuming
this burden, the opinion said,
"if the public health Is to be
protected . . from exploita-
tion by those who, for a profit
motive, undertake to supply
in Florida
"if the public health is to be protected
In a practical sense from exploitation
by those who, for a profit motive,
undertake to supply the vast and ever
increasing variety of products which
the people by unprecedented powers
of commercial persuasion are daily
urged to use and consume."'
Nonsense!
What the court Is saying, in effect,
Is that the people can't be trusted,
that It's too dangerous to let them
make their own free choices. Tobacco
companies, like distillers and manu-
facturers of kitchen knives, exist to
meet a popular demand. If their prod-
ucts involve some risks for the users,
so be It.
Thank Heaven we still live in a
society that lets Its people freely elect
to take those risks or not-whether
the risk Is a cut thumb, a hangover,
a sore throat, or cancer.

WESTPORT, April 24-A direct
•relationship between lung cancer
and cigarette smoking was offi-
cially recognized here today b~
the Connecticut Public Health as-
sociation which voted unanimous-
ly to endorse a' resolution con-
demning the habit.
About 150 public health officials,
at the annual CPHA spring meet-
ing in the Longshore paric restau-
rant, agreed that "m o u n t i n g
scientific evidence" has establish-
ed that excessive cigarette smok-
ing is a major health threat.
The CPHA noted the connection I
between cigarette smoking andj
chronic bronchitis and emphys2-l
ma, and agreed that smoking
cigarettes aggravates the symp-
toms of corona .ry heart disease
attd may be a causative factor in
the disease.
If present trends continue, the
health officials said, an estimated
million American school' children
will die of lung cancer before they
reach the age of 70.
The association aAreed, to call
on its membership and all official
and voluntary health and educa-
tionaf agencies within the state to
carry on an educational program
that will make all adults aware of
cluded addresses and panel dis-
cussions on various phar:es of pub-
lic health activities.
and will guide young people "to
chocse not to smoke cigarettes".
The association also passed a
resolution supporting the use of
seao belts in all automobiles and
urged that the State instal('such
safety devices in~ all, state-owned
cars that do not now have the
equipment. The-public health pffi-
cials also reiterated on their earl-
ier endorsement of, the fluorida-
tion of public water supplies to
prevent tcoth decay.
The CPHA also adopted a reso-
lution calling for the expansion of
the public health program on the
local level. At present, there arc
only 16 full-time health depart-
ments in Connecticut, which cover
only 62 per cent of, the state's
population, the association said.
The association also paid tribute
to three members of the group
who died last year. Cited were the

oSmoking Laws
By John Corey ' No wonder some educators are
•
•
\
Distributed by Phi Delta Kappa ready to toss in the towel. Why
It's,a wonder our young people
take grown-ups as seriously as
they do. Adult society is monu-
mentally two-faced. We say one
thing and do another. Take smok-
ing, for instance.
Most state laws clearly prohibit
smoking by students and teach-
ers on school grounds.
Sale of tobacco to youngsters
under 18 Is unlawful In most
places.
. Coaches usually outlaw "t h e
weed" for their athletes.
Health teachers tell pupils year
after year that heavy -&amp;,moking
may cause cancer, that toTiaco
contains nicotine (a drug highly
poisonous in its pure state)s that
inhaling deposits a tarry sub-
stance in lung tissues, that ex-
cessive tobacco use slows appetite
and indigestion, that nicotine
causes a temporary "lift" to the
nerves which helps make tobacco
habit forming,
. .Thus smoking has many draw-
backs. Yet members of every seg-
ment of society smoke. Mothers
and fathers puff In the home.
Their kiddies . even light up for
them. Ash trays are standard
equipment everywhere.
Medical doctors e n j o y toba-
co. So do big-time athletes - at
least they endorse their favorite
brands for money. Even teach-
ers, from first grade up, fog school
iounges with tobacco fumes.
The armed services permit' the
giving of cigarettes to young GIs.
Colleges often allow distribution
of tobacco samples to co-eds on
campus.
A growing number of parents
permit their high school - a g e
youngsters to smoke at home.
"I don't want him smoking be-
hind my back, so I let him smoke
in front of ine," was the weak-
kneed approach of one parent.
Teen - a g e r s encounter little
trouble in buying tobacco. If the
law were Inforced, said one prin-
cipal, "we would either have
truck-loads of cigarettes, or three-
fourths of our students would bee
on suspension."
should high school principals
break their backs enforcinr• n-
smoking laws when society it:;af
mocks them?
Right or wrong. some school of-
ficials have established, in' defi-
ance of their state statues, escape
hatches for high-schoolers who
have just got• to have their
,.drags."
An Alameda, Calif., vice prin-
cipal, Louis Grant' Brandes, sam-
pled 110 large high schools in
California and learned that 10 pro-
vide smoking areas where stu-
dents can puff during noon hour
a5 well as before and after schooI..
The practice is probably much
more common than this sampling
in,licates.
The officia}s justified the smok-
ing areas by saying that Califor-
nia statues are unrealistic.
"Students will smoke," most of
the principals said. "Denying the
-privilege will only lead' to deceit
and evasion, Some well controlled
systeln is needed, one that wlllinot
glorify the smoker In the eyes of
the non-'smoTcer:" =
Another permissive principal
said that, without' designated
smoking areas for both boys and
girls he would spend much of, his
time policing lavatories, boiler
ruoms, and other such places.
Iviost principals responded to
the Alameda survey by saying,
"It is poor education procedure
to provide a smoking area on or
'near school grounds when thiss
would be breaking the law. As
long as the law is on the books, I'
am going to do everything in my
power to support the law!"
There's no question that this
latter group of schoolmen are on
the right' side. And they're on it
despite apathy and even opposi-
tion from the rest of society. No-g smoking laws for teen - agers
should either be enforced or abo-
lished.

Children's Smoking
Is Called Unrelated
To Parents' Habits
Epecitl to The New York Tfines
STAMFORD, Co~n., May 2
There appears to be no direct
relationship between the amok-
ing habits 4f parents and chil-
dren, a survey found today.
"Far more importa.at," it' was
discovered, is whether the ado-
lescent'S frionds smoke.
The cunciusions were con-
tained in a study of the smok-
&lt;ng habits of 306 students in
the ninth and eleventh grades
e: the Rippowam High School
and the Turn of the River
Junior High School here.
The study, described sa pre-
liminary, was conducted by Dr.
Bernard J. Bergen of the Yale
Medical School, for the Tuber-
culosis and Health Association
of Southern Fairfield County.
Fourteen per cent of the ninth

oSmoking Laws
By John Corey ' No wonder some educators are
•
•
\
Distributed by Phi Delta Kappa ready to toss in the towel. Why
It's,a wonder our young people
take grown-ups as seriously as
they do. Adult society is monu-
mentally two-faced. We say one
thing and do another. Take smok-
ing, for instance.
Most state laws clearly prohibit
smoking by students and teach-
ers on school grounds.
Sale of tobacco to youngsters
under 18 Is unlawful In most
places.
. Coaches usually outlaw "t h e
weed" for their athletes.
Health teachers tell pupils year
after year that heavy -&amp;,moking
may cause cancer, that toTiaco
contains nicotine (a drug highly
poisonous in its pure state)s that
inhaling deposits a tarry sub-
stance in lung tissues, that ex-
cessive tobacco use slows appetite
and indigestion, that nicotine
causes a temporary "lift" to the
nerves which helps make tobacco
habit forming,
. .Thus smoking has many draw-
backs. Yet members of every seg-
ment of society smoke. Mothers
and fathers puff In the home.
Their kiddies . even light up for
them. Ash trays are standard
equipment everywhere.
Medical doctors e n j o y toba-
co. So do big-time athletes - at
least they endorse their favorite
brands for money. Even teach-
ers, from first grade up, fog school
iounges with tobacco fumes.
The armed services permit' the
giving of cigarettes to young GIs.
Colleges often allow distribution
of tobacco samples to co-eds on
campus.
A growing number of parents
permit their high school - a g e
youngsters to smoke at home.
"I don't want him smoking be-
hind my back, so I let him smoke
in front of ine," was the weak-
kneed approach of one parent.
Teen - a g e r s encounter little
trouble in buying tobacco. If the
law were Inforced, said one prin-
cipal, "we would either have
truck-loads of cigarettes, or three-
fourths of our students would bee
on suspension."
should high school principals
break their backs enforcinr• n-
smoking laws when society it:;af
mocks them?
Right or wrong. some school of-
ficials have established, in' defi-
ance of their state statues, escape
hatches for high-schoolers who
have just got• to have their
,.drags."
An Alameda, Calif., vice prin-
cipal, Louis Grant' Brandes, sam-
pled 110 large high schools in
California and learned that 10 pro-
vide smoking areas where stu-
dents can puff during noon hour
a5 well as before and after schooI..
The practice is probably much
more common than this sampling
in,licates.
The officia}s justified the smok-
ing areas by saying that Califor-
nia statues are unrealistic.
"Students will smoke," most of
the principals said. "Denying the
-privilege will only lead' to deceit
and evasion, Some well controlled
systeln is needed, one that wlllinot
glorify the smoker In the eyes of
the non-'smoTcer:" =
Another permissive principal
said that, without' designated
smoking areas for both boys and
girls he would spend much of, his
time policing lavatories, boiler
ruoms, and other such places.
Iviost principals responded to
the Alameda survey by saying,
"It is poor education procedure
to provide a smoking area on or
'near school grounds when thiss
would be breaking the law. As
long as the law is on the books, I'
am going to do everything in my
power to support the law!"
There's no question that this
latter group of schoolmen are on
the right' side. And they're on it
despite apathy and even opposi-
tion from the rest of society. No-g smoking laws for teen - agers
should either be enforced or abo-
lished.

"Far more importa.at," it' was
discovered, is whether the ado-
lescent'S frionds smoke.
The cunciusions were con-

&lt;ng habits of 306 students in
the ninth and eleventh grades

and the Turn of the River
Junior High School here.
The study, described sa pre-

Bernard J. Bergen of the Yale
Medical School, for the Tuber-

of Southern Fairfield County.
Fourteen per cent of the ninth

The National Congress of
Parents and Teachers yester-
day challenged what one of-
ficial called the "smokewash-
ing" of teen - agers by
glamorized tobacco advertis-
ing.
The congress, in its annual
convention here, voted to step
up its efforts against teen-
aged smoking, and to invite
representatives of the tobacco
and advertising industries to
an exchange of views on ad-
vertising techniques.
Mrs. Clifford N. Jenkins,
president of the 12 million
member congress, said Invi-
tations would be sent out for
a meeting at the congress
headquarters in Chicago in
carly fall. Business represen-
tatives -of the press, radio,
television and magazines also
will be invited.
"We are certain the invl-.
tations will be accepted," Mrs.•
Jenkins said. ,
The resolution calling sor
the action was approved over-
whelmingly by the estimated
1,000 voting delegates. It orig-
inated with separate resolu-
tions proposed by PTAs in
Utah and'
Columbia.
the District of
Eva H. Grant, editor of the
PTA magazine, said after the
vote: "The smoke that pours
from the mouths of televi,
sion announcers is getting
into the minds as well as the
eyes of the children. Ameri'-
caii teen-agers are being
smokewashed."
Several delegates said pri-
vately it was futile for the.
PTA to challenge forces as
powerful as Madison Avenue
and the tobacco industry.
4ne, who requested anony-
mity, said: "This will, only un-
derscore the public image of
the PTA as a completely im-
practical organization titling
at windmills."
. Mrs. Jenkins, however, said
there was ample pr€cedent
for the action. A national
boycott by PTA members in
1956, she said, forced comiE;
book publishers to "clean up"
their publications. A meeting
with representatives of the
liquor industry at' about the
same time was instrumental
in keeping advertisements for
hard liquor off radio and
television.
Similar meetings also had
been held with representa-
tives of the movie Industry in
an attempt to curb what PTA
officials have called "the out-
rageously lurid" advertising
of films.
The nation:l organization,
representing 47,000 local units,
has had no official policy on
teen-age smoking. Hovrever,
the PTA nSagazine, its of9-
cial spokesman, has -long
campaigned againFt i`.

(AP)-The National Congress
of Parents and Teachers chal-

called the ' smoke-washing" of
teen-agers by glamorized tobac-

The congress, In its annual

ber groups, said that invitations
would be sent out for a meet-
ing at the organization's head-
quarters in Chicago in early
fall. Business representatives of
the press, radio, television and
magazines will also be invited.
The resolution calling for the
action was adopted overwhelm-
ingly by the 1,000 voting dele,
gates. It originated with sep-
arate resolutions proposed by
Parent-Teacher groups in Utah
and the District of Columl}ia.

vote:
"The smoke that pours from

Several delegates said private

industry.
One said that "this will onlyy
underscore the public image of
the P.T.A. as a,.compietely im-
practicai organization tilting at'
windmills,"
Mrs,i-7enkins, however, said
there was ample precedent for
the action.
A national boycott by the
organization's members in 1956,
she said, forced comic book pub-
lishers to "clean up"' their pub-
lication. A meeting with rep-

BUSINESS LAW
Tobacco's Bout with Cancer .
&lt; Edwin Green was a Florida construc-
tion executive who smoked one or two
packs of Lucky Strikes daily for*most
of his adult life and died in 1958, at
the age of 49, of lung cancer.. His widow
and son sued for $1,500,000 'damages
from the American Tobacco Co., maker
,: of Luckies. Last week, after the claim
C~ had been struck down by a district court
"~ and a federal appeals court, the Florida
~ Supreme Court handed down an "ad-
visory opinion" that both the manur
fac'turer and the distributor of ciga-
rettes can indeed be held liable for
es
dama
g
~--
~ The entire $8 billion-a-year U.S. to- .
`, bacco industry shuddered, and stocks
of the five. major cigarette makers
slipped by 2% to 3% in the two days
~ after the Florida ruling. In similar dam-
age cases elsewhere, the courts have
\ been trending 1 against the cigarette
companies. At first, courts from Mas-
sachusetts to Louisiana threw out the
damage claims; then last November a
federal district court jury in Pittsburgh
found that Chesterfields (Liggett &amp; My-
ers) had been "one of the causes" of
lung cancer in a suing carpenter, but
absolved the company on grounds that
the smoker had knowingly assumed the
risk. The Florida court went much far-
ther, ruling ihat . American Tobacco's
very act of marketing and advertising
contained an "implied wairanty" that
cigarettes are safe.
If the decision stands after future
appeals, it could open all the cigarette
companies to damage claims from Flor-
ida lung cancer victims or their heirs
and set an influential, though not in-
flexible, precedent, that courts in other
states will refer to. Says Chester In-
wald, general counsel of the National
Association of Tobacco Distrihtittu:+:
"What the cigarette companieN will
have to contend with is the ghost of
advertisements long past, which claimed
~ such things as 'nose, throat and acces-
sory organs are not 'adversely affect-
ed.' " But lawyers do not think that the
Florida ruling could be used as a•basis
for citthosis victims to sue whisky dis-
tillers, or cholesterol~clogged heart pa-
tients to sue dairy companies. Reason:
No court has 'ever held that such prod-
ucts are harmful.

Smoking and Liability
Edwin M. Green, a Miami contractor,
was told in 1958 that he had an in-
operable lung cancer., Before he died in
1958 at the age of 49,, he left an un-
usual deposition with his lawyer: he
said he had smoked two to three packs
of Lucky Strike cigarettes a day for
nearly 30 years, and' he wanted a dam-
age suit' entered on behalf of his widow
and estate against the manufacturer,
the American Tobacco Co.
. The $250,000 Green case turned out
to be the first cigarette-cancer damage
suit in the U.S. in which the plaintiff
drew a favorable legal nod.
In a precedent=setting decision in Au-
gust 1960, a jury (eleven of them ciga-
rette smokers) in the U.S; District Court
in Miami.dacided that smoking Luckles
had indeed been a cause of Green's can-
cer-but the jury added that the com-
pany was not liable, because it could
not have known such a thing would hap-
pen. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in New Orleans upheld the decision-
but then granted a rehearing. At the
same time, it asked the Florida Supreme
Court what the company's liability was
under the state's law.
The state court's 5-2 decision-which
could be a sharp setback for the tobacco
industry-was rendered last week by
Justice E. Harris Drew, a cigarette
smoker himself. A manufacturer who
sells a product for human consumption
implies it is safe,,Drew advised'the Court
of Appeals, and therefore the company
must be held liable even for an un-
predictable adverse effect on health.
The American Tobacco Co. withheld
any immediate comment. Next step:, re-
hearing of the case before the U.S.
Court of Appeals in New Orleans.

WESTPORT, April 24-A direct
•relationship between lung cancer
and cigarette smoking was offi-
cially recognized here today b~
the Connecticut Public Health as-
sociation which voted unanimous-
ly to endorse a' resolution con-
demning the habit.
About 150 public health officials,
at the annual CPHA spring meet-
ing in the Longshore paric restau-
rant, agreed that "m o u n t i n g
scientific evidence" has establish-
ed that excessive cigarette smok-
ing is a major health threat.
The CPHA noted the connection I
between cigarette smoking andj
chronic bronchitis and emphys2-l
ma, and agreed that smoking
cigarettes aggravates the symp-
toms of corona .ry heart disease
attd may be a causative factor in
the disease.
If present trends continue, the
health officials said, an estimated
million American school' children
will die of lung cancer before they
reach the age of 70.
The association aAreed, to call
on its membership and all official
and voluntary health and educa-
tionaf agencies within the state to
carry on an educational program
that will make all adults aware of
cluded addresses and panel dis-
cussions on various phar:es of pub-
lic health activities.
and will guide young people "to
chocse not to smoke cigarettes".
The association also passed a
resolution supporting the use of
seao belts in all automobiles and
urged that the State instal('such
safety devices in~ all, state-owned
cars that do not now have the
equipment. The-public health pffi-
cials also reiterated on their earl-
ier endorsement of, the fluorida-
tion of public water supplies to
prevent tcoth decay.
The CPHA also adopted a reso-
lution calling for the expansion of
the public health program on the
local level. At present, there arc
only 16 full-time health depart-
ments in Connecticut, which cover
only 62 per cent of, the state's
population, the association said.
The association also paid tribute
to three members of the group
who died last year. Cited were the
late Dr. Alfred L. Burgdort, fdr-

But f ust as emphatically we do NOT

through a piece of legislation now fii
the works in the state legislature "Its
intentions may be good, but, to para=
,, phrase the poet, "What a tangled rveli

we: may create, when we try too much
to legislate."
This bill would outlaw any television

broadcast, billboard display, `iiews=
paper, magazine or any publication
circulated In this state if any of these
proffered an advertisement, in which a
_person "shall be depicted or shown`_

Again, our anti-cigarette legislators

enforcement must also be considered. `?a
When that latter, vital element Is
given full consideration, surely the ~

be transformed into a memorial to
Congress urging a national approach
to the problem, and then a new debate

TAI3,AHASSEE, F'la., June 61 The district eourt at Miami
(AP) .-The Florida Bupre me
Court has ruled that cigarette
manufacturers, may be held
liable for the harmful, effects
.of their products on the human
body. I •
In an advisory opinion writ-
ten for the United States 5th
Circuit Court of Appeals at
New Orleans, the Florida, court
said It was not essential in
such cases for the manufac-
turer to be aware of the harm-
ful effects of his products to
be held liable for damages.
The advisory opinion was
asked in a suit brought by the
late Edwin Green of Miami in
1957 against the American
Tobacco Co. Mr. Green charged
that he became afflicted with
lung cancer as a result of
amoking Lucky Strike ciga-
found that the company was
not liable for the effects of
Its products on the human
body since the manufacturer
could not "by human skill and
foresight" have known of any
danger.
Meanwhile, tobacco company
stock prices showed a drop
today in response to the
Florida decision. '
Mr. Green died February 25.
1958: His widow Mary and
son. Edwin Green, Jr., ap-
pealed the decision.
The appellate court then
granted a rehearing of the
case and requested an advisory
opinion of the Florida Su-

provision of Florida law which
permits such opinions to be
rendered by Federal courts.
The opinion states that

Nonsense
It's silly season on the cigarette
front again. 'I31e Florida Supreme
Court has just held that, under
Florida law, a cigarette manufacturer
can be held liable for a death due to
Jung cancer.
,,:;;
This makes about as much sense as
allowing a damage suit against the
distiller when an alcoholic drinks
himself to death. Or letting a driver
sue General Motors when he piles his
car into a tree.
* In another case last November, a
Federal court jury. in Pittsburgh ab-
iolved Liggett &amp; Myers of responsi-
bility In a lung cancer case, on the
perfectly reasonable premise that the
plaintiff, by smoking, had assumed
the risk of injury.
.. But now the Florida court says
ithere can be no valid objection to
placing liability on the manufacturer
manufacturer and distributor
of the cigarettes absolute lin-
bllitY for breach of "impiiPd
warranty" in the death of Mr
Green even though 4he manu-
facturer could not have known '
that users would be in danger
of contracting lung cancer.
The Florida court said it as- :
sumed from the Jury'a response
in the trial of the case that
the American Tobacco Com-,
pany'e cigarettes caused Mr.!
Green'a fatal lung cance=.
The court said it could not'
agree that prevailing indust'ry
standards should supplant or-~
dinary requirements of objec-,
tivity and truth in the market-
ing of a product.
This, the court said, would
be shifting the burden from
the seller to the buyer forf the
risk of whatever latent defec-
tiveness may ultimately be
proved,
There can be no valid ob-
iection to indust'ry assuming
this burden, the opinion said,

protected . . from exploita-
tion by those who, for a profit
motive, undertake to supply

"if the public health is to be protected
In a practical sense from exploitation
by those who, for a profit motive,
undertake to supply the vast and ever
increasing variety of products which
the people by unprecedented powers
of commercial persuasion are daily
urged to use and consume."'
Nonsense!
What the court Is saying, in effect,
Is that the people can't be trusted,
that It's too dangerous to let them
make their own free choices. Tobacco
companies, like distillers and manu-
facturers of kitchen knives, exist to
meet a popular demand. If their prod-
ucts involve some risks for the users,
so be It.
Thank Heaven we still live in a
society that lets Its people freely elect
to take those risks or not-whether
the risk Is a cut thumb, a hangover,
a sore throat, or cancer.

The 222-page paperbound version is in print but apparently is not yet in
distribution though it was to have been.available June 17. The price to
Consuaers Union subscribers is $1.00 for paperbound, $2.001for clothbound.
Fbr non-subscribers the prices are $1.50 and $3.50. (See TNS Nos. 33-3k,

As expected, the book is essentially a manifesto calling for "time, money
and effort" to "gradually convert us into a non-cigarette-smoking nation again."

The 23-chapt'er book, with an introduction signed by CU President Dexter Masters,
consists almost entirely of four parts titled: I. The MedicaL Evidence;
II. The Industry: Science &amp; Public Relations; III. The Industry: Advertising
&amp; Health; IV. Points for a Program. There are three appendices on anti-smoking
drugs, little cigars vs. cigarettes, and "tar" and nicotine content of
cigarettes as found in CU tests in 1955-1961.
Part I, digested in the June 1963 issue of Consumer Reports, is based on highly
selective scientific material. (See TNS No. 30, May 10, 1963.) Parts II and
III discuss various industry activities, such as Tobacco Industry Research _
Committee, The Tobacco Institute, Inc., advertising, the teen-age market, etc.
The effect is entirely derogatory -- the authors contend that the industry is
knowingly avoiding its responsibilities in the smoking-health situation.
Part IV recommends consideration of these possible elements in a nation-wide
anti-smoking program that is expeeted to be forthcoming:
Prohibition of sales to minors, smoking by minors, sales through unattended
vending machines, smoking in specified places, or other limited prohibitions.
Increased taxes on cigarettes to discourage smoking, or use of selective
taxation to discourage manufacture and sale of cigarettes with high
nicotine and tar content.
Cigarette labelling -- either a health warning, or nicotine and "tar"'content,
or bWth.
4. Regulation or even outright prohibition of cigarette advertising.
5. Counter-advertising to warn the public of the health hazards of cigarette smoking.
6. An education program aimed at elementary, high school and college students.
7.
A system of clinics and other therapeutic aids to help individual smokers
or groups of smokers to stop smoking.
The book comments that "$125 million a year seems like a modest sum indeed"'for
an anti-cigarette education program.

Tobacco's Bout with Cancer .
&lt; Edwin Green was a Florida construc-
tion executive who smoked one or two
packs of Lucky Strikes daily for*most
of his adult life and died in 1958, at
the age of 49, of lung cancer.. His widow
and son sued for $1,500,000 'damages
from the American Tobacco Co., maker
,: of Luckies. Last week, after the claim
C~ had been struck down by a district court
"~ and a federal appeals court, the Florida
~ Supreme Court handed down an "ad-
visory opinion" that both the manur
fac'turer and the distributor of ciga-
rettes can indeed be held liable for
es
dama
g
~--
~ The entire $8 billion-a-year U.S. to- .
`, bacco industry shuddered, and stocks
of the five. major cigarette makers
slipped by 2% to 3% in the two days
~ after the Florida ruling. In similar dam-
age cases elsewhere, the courts have
\ been trending 1 against the cigarette
companies. At first, courts from Mas-
sachusetts to Louisiana threw out the
damage claims; then last November a
federal district court jury in Pittsburgh
found that Chesterfields (Liggett &amp; My-
ers) had been "one of the causes" of
lung cancer in a suing carpenter, but
absolved the company on grounds that
the smoker had knowingly assumed the
risk. The Florida court went much far-
ther, ruling ihat . American Tobacco's
very act of marketing and advertising
contained an "implied wairanty" that
cigarettes are safe.
If the decision stands after future
appeals, it could open all the cigarette
companies to damage claims from Flor-
ida lung cancer victims or their heirs
and set an influential, though not in-
flexible, precedent, that courts in other
states will refer to. Says Chester In-
wald, general counsel of the National
Association of Tobacco Distrihtittu:+:
"What the cigarette companieN will
have to contend with is the ghost of
advertisements long past, which claimed
~ such things as 'nose, throat and acces-
sory organs are not 'adversely affect-
ed.' " But lawyers do not think that the
Florida ruling could be used as a•basis
for citthosis victims to sue whisky dis-
tillers, or cholesterol~clogged heart pa-
tients to sue dairy companies. Reason:
No court has 'ever held that such prod-
ucts are harmful.

Smoking and Liability
Edwin M. Green, a Miami contractor,
was told in 1958 that he had an in-
operable lung cancer., Before he died in
1958 at the age of 49,, he left an un-
usual deposition with his lawyer: he
said he had smoked two to three packs
of Lucky Strike cigarettes a day for
nearly 30 years, and' he wanted a dam-
age suit' entered on behalf of his widow
and estate against the manufacturer,
the American Tobacco Co.
. The $250,000 Green case turned out
to be the first cigarette-cancer damage
suit in the U.S. in which the plaintiff
drew a favorable legal nod.
In a precedent=setting decision in Au-
gust 1960, a jury (eleven of them ciga-
rette smokers) in the U.S; District Court
in Miami.dacided that smoking Luckles
had indeed been a cause of Green's can-
cer-but the jury added that the com-
pany was not liable, because it could
not have known such a thing would hap-
pen. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in New Orleans upheld the decision-
but then granted a rehearing. At the
same time, it asked the Florida Supreme
Court what the company's liability was
under the state's law.
The state court's 5-2 decision-which
could be a sharp setback for the tobacco
industry-was rendered last week by
Justice E. Harris Drew, a cigarette
smoker himself. A manufacturer who
sells a product for human consumption
implies it is safe,,Drew advised'the Court
of Appeals, and therefore the company
must be held liable even for an un-
predictable adverse effect on health.
The American Tobacco Co. withheld
any immediate comment. Next step:, re-
hearing of the case before the U.S.
Court of Appeals in New Orleans.

DR. HAROLD DORN,


RESEARCHER, DIES

WASHINGTON, May 9 (AP)
-Dr. Harold F. Dorn, whose
studies in 1959 led to the Pub-
lic lic Health Service's search for
links between lung cancer and
smoking, died at the National
Institutes of Health in Bethes-
da, Md. He was 56 years old.
The cause of death was not dis-
` closed.

Dr. Dorn had been chief of
.the biometrics research branch
of the National Heart Institute
there since 1960.
A native of Tompkins County,
N. Y., he attended Cornell and
the University of Wisconsin. He
was- internationally recognized
in the field of biometrics re-
search-the application of sta-
tistical methods to biologicai
facts.
Since 1932 he had worked to
standardize the methods used in

the collect'ion, analysis and eval-
uation of statistics in public
health and medical research.
Dr. Dorn's 1959 study provided
3tatistical evidence that the
death rate from lung cancer
&amp;nd cardiovascular and respira-
t'ory diseases is much higher
among men who have used to-
bacco.
In that year Surgeon General
Leroy E. Burney declared for
the first time that evidence im-
licated `smoking as the main
cause of rising lung cancer. The
Government has since been
making studies that are expect-
ed to produce a more defini-
e tive stand on the dispute. The
Am'erica4L Tobacco Institute
cc:.tends there is no proven con-
nection between lung cancer and
smoking.
In 1961, the Department of

Welfare cited Dr. Dorn al "the
Federal Government's outstand-
ing leader in the field of bio-
metric theory and practice." He
had been with the Public Health
Service since 1936.
His widow, Celia, has,worked
t at the National Institutes of
Health since 1956. Atso surviv-
ing are two daughters, Mrs.
Patricia Adams of East Lan-
sing, Mich., and Mrs. Eleanor
Phillips of Ann Arbor, Mich.

Meeting the flood of literature
claiming to associate cigarette
smoking with lung cancer, t h e

Tobbaco Growers Information
Committee points out confusion
and discrepancy in the claims..
Among other things, , the state-
ment points out leading members
of the medical profession at one
time believed pellagara to be an

infection, horseback riding was a

good treatment for tuberculosis
and typhoid and typhus were va-
rieties of the same fever. All of
these ideas were proven wrong
later.
Among the points of refutation
of the cigarette and lung cancer

elaim, the statement points out:

1. Berkson's and Fisher's arti-
cles questioning the statistical va-
lidity of the material on cigarette
smoking and lung cancer.
2. Urban groups suffer lung can-
cer more than comparable rural
groups - smoking habits not with-

standing.

3. In England lung cancer mor-
tality is lower among men in the
two highest social classes. An
American ins.iiance company has
noted the same thing. Higher than
average mortality lung cancer
rates have been noted in paint-

ers, roofers, carpenters, tinsmiths

and electricians, suggesting the

possibility of industrial poisons.

4. Spontaneous lung cancer has
been described in nonsmoking ani-
mals and humans.
5. Lung cancer has increased
both in countries where cigarette
consumption has gonH up sharply
and likewise, in countries where
cigarette consumption has been
stationary.
6. Lung cancer has been in-
orluced in laboratory animals, us-
ing human adeno-virus.
7. Smokers differ nonsmokers in
various psychological variables as
occupation, residence, annual in•
come, frequency of automobile ac-
cidents, number of psychosomatic
symtoms„ number of cups• of cof-
fee consumed daily, amount , of

liquor consumed and social mobil-
ity:
8. The U. S. Public Health
Service has found evidence of a
familiar factor of "host suscepti-
bility" which increases mortality
rates 300 per cent even In non-
smokers. ~1;416;
9. Results of one study strongly
support the Idea that. chromo-
some abnormalities play a signi-
ficant role in most types of can-
cer.
10. The U. S. Public H e a 1 t h
Service haa shown that a large
part„ if not most, of the appar-
ent increase in certifieation of
death due to lung cancer can be
accounted for by changes in med-
ical practice and d'eath• certifica-
tion. Further, despite steadily in-
creasing cigarette smoking an-
nually, there has been a general
decline in rates of Increase of
mortality attributed to lung can-
cer for all groups.
Another study' shows tb!at noth-
ing shows the heavy cigarette
smoker to be stricken -with lung
cencer any earlier than the light
or non-smoker;
In South Africa the average
white male Is one of the heaviest
smokers in the world. Yet, the
death rate from careisnma of the
lung is less than that of ISen-
mark where the average male
smokes less than one-third the
n u m b e r of cigarettes. In the
United Kingdbm men smoke few-
er cigarettes but have more than
three times as much lung cancer
as the men in Australia.
Another worker commented,
just prior to the turn of the cen-
tury tobacco was blamed for tu-
berculosis. It was later found tu-
berculbsis was caused by other
sources. The same worker, Gar-
land, asks why primary lung can-
cer should be twice as common
in British men as in American
men, although cigarette consump-
tion is only half as great In
England as in the United States
per person.

~ 1 The industry will cooperate also
In an American Medical Associa-
tion tion review, Allen said in a year-
end statement, and the Tobacco
~ . Industry Research Committee will
continue to support the work of
independent scientists who are
looking into the matter.
.r "We in. the tobacco industry
recognize a special responsibility
to help science determine the
--- facts," he said.
The tobacco industry contends
no direct link between smoking
and lung cancer has been~proved.
Physicians generally are divided
on the question. .
who would propose restrictions
against smoking should be mind-
ful of all the facts, not just some
them:" ;
f~
I
Last month, the Surgeon Gen-
;eral's advisory committee on
smoking and health started a
broad review of "the scientific fit•
erature and basic studies on all
aspects of the use of tobacco and
smoking habits, as well as possi-
ble contribating factors such as
air pollution, industrial exposure,

DR. HAROLD DORN,


RESEARCHER, DIES

WASHINGTON, May 9 (AP)
-Dr. Harold F. Dorn, whose
studies in 1959 led to the Pub-
lic lic Health Service's search for
links between lung cancer and
smoking, died at the National
Institutes of Health in Bethes-
da, Md. He was 56 years old.
The cause of death was not dis-
` closed.

Dr. Dorn had been chief of
.the biometrics research branch
of the National Heart Institute
there since 1960.
A native of Tompkins County,
N. Y., he attended Cornell and
the University of Wisconsin. He
was- internationally recognized
in the field of biometrics re-
search-the application of sta-
tistical methods to biologicai
facts.
Since 1932 he had worked to
standardize the methods used in

the collect'ion, analysis and eval-
uation of statistics in public
health and medical research.
Dr. Dorn's 1959 study provided
3tatistical evidence that the
death rate from lung cancer
&amp;nd cardiovascular and respira-
t'ory diseases is much higher
among men who have used to-
bacco.
In that year Surgeon General
Leroy E. Burney declared for
the first time that evidence im-
licated `smoking as the main
cause of rising lung cancer. The
Government has since been
making studies that are expect-
ed to produce a more defini-
e tive stand on the dispute. The
Am'erica4L Tobacco Institute
cc:.tends there is no proven con-
nection between lung cancer and
smoking.
In 1961, the Department of

Welfare cited Dr. Dorn al "the
Federal Government's outstand-
ing leader in the field of bio-
metric theory and practice." He
had been with the Public Health
Service since 1936.
His widow, Celia, has,worked
t at the National Institutes of
Health since 1956. Atso surviv-
ing are two daughters, Mrs.
Patricia Adams of East Lan-
sing, Mich., and Mrs. Eleanor
Phillips of Ann Arbor, Mich.

Meeting the flood of literature
claiming to associate cigarette
smoking with lung cancer, t h e

Tobbaco Growers Information
Committee points out confusion
and discrepancy in the claims..
Among other things, , the state-
ment points out leading members
of the medical profession at one
time believed pellagara to be an

infection, horseback riding was a

good treatment for tuberculosis
and typhoid and typhus were va-
rieties of the same fever. All of
these ideas were proven wrong
later.
Among the points of refutation
of the cigarette and lung cancer

elaim, the statement points out:

1. Berkson's and Fisher's arti-
cles questioning the statistical va-
lidity of the material on cigarette
smoking and lung cancer.
2. Urban groups suffer lung can-
cer more than comparable rural
groups - smoking habits not with-

standing.

3. In England lung cancer mor-
tality is lower among men in the
two highest social classes. An
American ins.iiance company has
noted the same thing. Higher than
average mortality lung cancer
rates have been noted in paint-

ers, roofers, carpenters, tinsmiths

and electricians, suggesting the

possibility of industrial poisons.

4. Spontaneous lung cancer has
been described in nonsmoking ani-
mals and humans.
5. Lung cancer has increased
both in countries where cigarette
consumption has gonH up sharply
and likewise, in countries where
cigarette consumption has been
stationary.
6. Lung cancer has been in-
orluced in laboratory animals, us-
ing human adeno-virus.
7. Smokers differ nonsmokers in
various psychological variables as
occupation, residence, annual in•
come, frequency of automobile ac-
cidents, number of psychosomatic
symtoms„ number of cups• of cof-
fee consumed daily, amount , of

liquor consumed and social mobil-
ity:
8. The U. S. Public Health
Service has found evidence of a
familiar factor of "host suscepti-
bility" which increases mortality
rates 300 per cent even In non-
smokers. ~1;416;
9. Results of one study strongly
support the Idea that. chromo-
some abnormalities play a signi-
ficant role in most types of can-
cer.
10. The U. S. Public H e a 1 t h
Service haa shown that a large
part„ if not most, of the appar-
ent increase in certifieation of
death due to lung cancer can be
accounted for by changes in med-
ical practice and d'eath• certifica-
tion. Further, despite steadily in-
creasing cigarette smoking an-
nually, there has been a general
decline in rates of Increase of
mortality attributed to lung can-
cer for all groups.
Another study' shows tb!at noth-
ing shows the heavy cigarette
smoker to be stricken -with lung
cencer any earlier than the light
or non-smoker;
In South Africa the average
white male Is one of the heaviest
smokers in the world. Yet, the
death rate from careisnma of the
lung is less than that of ISen-
mark where the average male
smokes less than one-third the
n u m b e r of cigarettes. In the
United Kingdbm men smoke few-
er cigarettes but have more than
three times as much lung cancer
as the men in Australia.
Another worker commented,
just prior to the turn of the cen-
tury tobacco was blamed for tu-
berculosis. It was later found tu-
berculbsis was caused by other
sources. The same worker, Gar-
land, asks why primary lung can-
cer should be twice as common
in British men as in American
men, although cigarette consump-
tion is only half as great In
England as in the United States
per person.

Tobacco's Bout with Cancer .
&lt; Edwin Green was a Florida construc-
tion executive who smoked one or two
packs of Lucky Strikes daily for*most
of his adult life and died in 1958, at
the age of 49, of lung cancer.. His widow
and son sued for $1,500,000 'damages
from the American Tobacco Co., maker
,: of Luckies. Last week, after the claim
C~ had been struck down by a district court
"~ and a federal appeals court, the Florida
~ Supreme Court handed down an "ad-
visory opinion" that both the manur

~ The entire $8 billion-a-year U.S. to- .
`, bacco industry shuddered, and stocks
of the five. major cigarette makers
slipped by 2% to 3% in the two days
~ after the Florida ruling. In similar dam-
age cases elsewhere, the courts have
\ been trending 1 against the cigarette
companies. At first, courts from Mas-
sachusetts to Louisiana threw out the
damage claims; then last November a
federal district court jury in Pittsburgh
found that Chesterfields (Liggett &amp; My-
ers) had been "one of the causes" of
lung cancer in a suing carpenter, but
absolved the company on grounds that
the smoker had knowingly assumed the
risk. The Florida court went much far-
ther, ruling ihat . American Tobacco's
very act of marketing and advertising
contained an "implied wairanty" that
cigarettes are safe.
If the decision stands after future
appeals, it could open all the cigarette
companies to damage claims from Flor-
ida lung cancer victims or their heirs
and set an influential, though not in-
flexible, precedent, that courts in other
states will refer to. Says Chester In-
wald, general counsel of the National
Association of Tobacco Distrihtittu:+:
"What the cigarette companieN will
have to contend with is the ghost of
advertisements long past, which claimed
~ such things as 'nose, throat and acces-
sory organs are not 'adversely affect-
ed.' " But lawyers do not think that the
Florida ruling could be used as a•basis
for citthosis victims to sue whisky dis-
tillers, or cholesterol~clogged heart pa-
tients to sue dairy companies. Reason:
No court has 'ever held that such prod-
ucts are harmful.

Smoking and Liability
Edwin M. Green, a Miami contractor,
was told in 1958 that he had an in-
operable lung cancer., Before he died in
1958 at the age of 49,, he left an un-
usual deposition with his lawyer: he
said he had smoked two to three packs
of Lucky Strike cigarettes a day for
nearly 30 years, and' he wanted a dam-
age suit' entered on behalf of his widow
and estate against the manufacturer,
the American Tobacco Co.
. The $250,000 Green case turned out
to be the first cigarette-cancer damage
suit in the U.S. in which the plaintiff
drew a favorable legal nod.
In a precedent=setting decision in Au-
gust 1960, a jury (eleven of them ciga-
rette smokers) in the U.S; District Court
in Miami.dacided that smoking Luckles
had indeed been a cause of Green's can-
cer-but the jury added that the com-
pany was not liable, because it could
not have known such a thing would hap-
pen. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in New Orleans upheld the decision-
but then granted a rehearing. At the
same time, it asked the Florida Supreme
Court what the company's liability was
under the state's law.
The state court's 5-2 decision-which
could be a sharp setback for the tobacco
industry-was rendered last week by
Justice E. Harris Drew, a cigarette
smoker himself. A manufacturer who
sells a product for human consumption
implies it is safe,,Drew advised'the Court
of Appeals, and therefore the company
must be held liable even for an un-
predictable adverse effect on health.
The American Tobacco Co. withheld
any immediate comment. Next step:, re-
hearing of the case before the U.S.
Court of Appeals in New Orleans.

obacc~ Industry Supports Study
7The use of tobacco in the United
States antedates the arrival of the white
man. It was generally supposed by In-
dians to possess medicinal properties
and this was the chief reason for its
early use following introduction into
Europe. . But in time, as man began to
derive some pleasure from. the leaf,
tobacco fell under a veil of suspicion
which thickened with the years.
: ' : Youngsters were discouraged from
embracing the habit with a warning
that "tobacco will stunt your growth."
And their first experience with this
product, which seemed so necessary to
adults, was made behind the barn or in
some spot isolated from adult eyes. The
young ladies of' the 1920s who- puffed a
cigarette in public were typed as daring,
if not immoral and, for reasons which
no one could adequately explain, the
cigarette earned the nickname, "coffin-
nail."
: Today, there is an expanding area of
opinion which holds that there is a de-
finite reason to be suspicious of tobacco
as harmful to health. In fact, some
would label it a major factor behind the
very high number of lung cancer. cases
on record.
Spokesmen for .the tobacco industry
contend that no real evidence exists to
support such a belief. But their denials
have lacked force when matched against

It may be, however, that use of tobacco
is one of many contributing f a c t o r s..
w h I c h, applied in combination, pave
the way for the development of lung
cancer. At,best, this is simply a poorly
educated guess. No one really I~nows
'=-yet. But it is hoped that the probe
into the full story of t o b a c c o and
health will provide long sought answers.
This is not a subject for careless
handling. The tobacco industry occupies
a major place in the American economy.
Consumers spent $6.9 billion for cigaret-
tes and $7.8 billion for all tobacco pro-
ducts this year. In addition, tobacco has
long been one of the chief sources of
revenue in many countries of the world.
For instance, the income of the U.S.
government in revenue from taxes col-
lected on manufactured tobacco pro-
ducts, particularly cigarettes, greatly
exceeds the sale value received by
farmers for the crop.
This is not to say that use of tobacco
must be defended if indisputable in-
formation reveals it a villain in the can-
cer story. But ib is to say that the
industry should not be subjected to a
careless attack on the basis of incom-

ase Against Smoking Still Unpr~ve
When will spurious reasoning on ills of smoking
- cease? It has been going on for over 350 years.
There's hardly a disease of mankind that hasn't
at one time or another been blamed on smoking.
`";All the greater pity is that some of the pres-
ent fuzzy thinking is being foisted by otherwise
,reputable groups. Take the case of American
Cancer Society, for example. We have been

About lung cancer, Dr. Leroy Hyde, chief,
- Pulmonary Disease Division, Long Beach
(Calif.) Veterans Administration Hospital, was
recently quoted as saying: "The medical pro-
fession may have been stampeded into a false
•belief that cigarette smoking is the principal
~ -cause." ~
" Dr, Hyde says he has seen 3,000 cases of
lung cancer. The hospital he serves "sees as
many lung cancer victims as any other hospital
in the world. The relationship of smoking to
human cancer is certainly unproved," he says. '
Those who earn their living from tobacco-
growers and manufacturers - are among the
most anxious of all groups to determine if smok-
ing has injurious effects on health. Through
their Tobacco Industry Research Committee
they have appropriated $6,250,000 for lung
cancer research. Provided are some 600 fel-
lowships in 90 of the nation's top universities,
hospitals, and research centers.
There are encouraging reasons to believe
the cause or causes of cancer may soon be
found. Until that happens, wouldn't it be much
fairer not to make indictments which cannot be
backed up with scientifically acceptable facts?

Last month, the Surgeon Gen-

smoking and health started a
broad review of "the scientific fit•

aspects of the use of tobacco and
smoking habits, as well as possi-
ble contribating factors such as
air pollution, industrial exposure,
radiation and alcohol."
The 10-member committee ex-
pects to take about six to eight
months to complete its report.
"The millions who gain their
livelihood from tobacco are vital-
~y interested in finding out the
full facts," Allen said. "They
have a double interest: As good
citizens and as members of a ma-
jor indust'ry."
In a review of 1962, Allen re-

- Distinguisli Fact, Theory in Dispute on Link
of Cigarets and Cancer, Allen, Harfneft Urge
WAStuNGToN, Jan. 2-Tw0 to- .
bacco industry spokesmen last
week called for "a stock-taking of
the scientific facts" about smoking
and lung cancer and "a clear dis-
tinction between that which is
known, that which is theory or
speculation, and that whil;h re -
mains to be learned."
In his annual review, George V.
Allen, president of the Tobacco
Institute, said the tobacco indus-
try's position is based on tvvo
"sound principles."
First; "the causes of lung cancer
are not now known to science," he
said. "Many factors are being stud-
ied, along with tobacco. The case
against tobacco is based largely on
statistical association studies, the
meanings of which are in dispute."'
Second~ "the millions who gain
their livelihood from tobacco are
vitally interested in finding
the full facts. They have a double
interest: As good citizens and' as
members of a major industry."
 Mr. Allen said cigaret sales in
,the.U.S. in 1962 totaled 510 billion
units, 8 billion more than in 1961'
and 26 billion ahead of 1960. Con-
sumers spent about $6.9 billion for
cigarets in 1962, about $200,000,000
more than the previous year.
Spending for all tobacco products
totaled about $7.8' billion, an in-
crease of $200,000,000.
He said nearly half the con-
sumer expenditure for cigarets in
1962 went to federal; state and
local excise taxes. Taxes on ciga-
rets in 1962 are estimated at $3.1
billion, about $100,000,000 more
than in 1961.
Mr. Allen said the use of cigars
and cigarillos increased to 7.14
out i billion units, or 100;000;000 more
t
than in 1961 and the highest
since
1923.
In addition, the U.S. exported
23.3 billion cigarets abroad in 1962, '";
about 5% above the 1961 Ievel., ~
The 1962 exports are valued at
$100,000,000. Leaf tobacco exports
are estimated' at $385,000,000 for
the xear.
 rne otner spoxesman, Timothy
V. Hartnett, chairman of the To-
bacco Industry Research Commit- `
tee, said that the repetition of sta-
tist~ically-based charges abouC' .
smoking and lung cancer "is not ~
scientific proof or new evidence:'.4
He said "a stock-taking of the
scientific facts seems called for.". _'
His own organization, he added, Is
' i
cooperating with the U.S. Surgeon
General's recently-appointed ad-. ;
visory committee on smoking rd
health.

Dr. Pratt Thomas' talk concern-
ed the budget and the needs of
the Medical College. He said that
the Medical College is a state in-
stitution and that its welfare and
accomplishments should be the
concern of every South Carolinian.

Other guests at the meeting
were Dr. Glen Askins and the Rev.
Oscar Holland.
and that -the state contributes
about $4,000 per student per year.
He explained, however, that a
large portion of this is due to the
fact that in the medical field it
is also necessary to train person-
nel in other fields such as techni-
cians, pharmacists, and nurses.
' He further stated that one dollar
out of every three in the medical
tollege budget is attributable to
the training of allied professions
{n the health field.
He also explained that training
in the health profession requires
patients, which in turn requires a
hospital in connection . with the
college and therefore adds addi-
tional costs to the budget.
The speaker stressed the need
for more facilities for traininig
nurses. He said that many hospi-
tals have discontinued their nurs-
ingr schools and that training faci-
lities for nurses are not now ade-
quate to train the nurses needed
in the years ahead.
In conclusion, Dr. Pratt-Thomas

&gt; -New Research Reports
On Lung Cancer Causes
New research reports indicate that
psychological and genetic factors may
;; provide important clues to the mys-
tery of lung cancer, according to To-
bacco and Health, a publication of the
Tobacco Institute, Inc. A study by two
Irit'ish psychologists indicates that the
personality traits of lung cancer pa-
tients differ significantly from those
of people without cancer. The traits
:; - of lung cancer victims also differ
from the personality patterns of smok-
ers studied, the psychologists reported
in the Journal of Psychosomatic Re-
search.
The findings suggest that "there is a
true relationship between personalitv
and cancer," the British experts said.
"Lung cancer patients do noU appear
to be a random selection of cigarette
' smokers."
In general, according to Drs. David
M. Kissen and H. J. Eysenck, lung
~ cancer patients "have a significantly
diminished' outlet for emotional dis-
charge" compared' with non-cancer
patients." Smokers studied, on the
__ other hand, tend to be more outgoing
-more extraverted-than cancer vic-
tims and non-smokers studied, they
said.
Another study, by a U. S. Public
Health Service scientist, indicated that
relatives of lung cancer patients have
a significantly increased risk of dying
of lung cancer whether they smoke
or not. This familiar factor was more
marked among non-smokers, said Dr.
George K. Tokahata in a paper pre-
sente&amp;before American Public Health
Association.
The scientist investigated the causes
of death among blood relatives of 270
lung cancer patients and compared
them with the histories of an equal
number of healthy persons living in
the same neighborhoods, mostly in
the Baltimore area. He found that lung
cancer mortality was 2 to 2.5 times
greater among relatives of patients
than in the control group. When non-
smokers were studied separately, can-
cer mortality among patient's relatives ' A high incidence of heart disease in

Word comes from the Tobacco Institute,
Inc. that almostt half of the-)ea+i3,gancer cas-
es found in a rural btidwestern area occur-
red in non~smokers, according to Dr. John
M. Tidd of Sacred Heart Hospitaly Uankton,
S.D. Furthermore, the lung cancer incidence
in this arra is lower by almost half than the
rate generally reported.
The same bulletin also reports research
propounding the theory that psychological
makeup is a factor in lung cancer.
While the tobacco industry may be able
to show that there are other factors in lung
cancer, no one has ever denied this. The
question for them remains whether or not
eigarette.smoking is a major cause. At pres-
ent, the best evidence points in that direc-
fiion. P. W.C.

and genetic factors may provide
Important clues to the mystery of
' lung cancer, it was reported to-
~ day in Tobacco and Health, pub-
~.:- llshed by The Tobacco Institute,
~ ' Inc.
A study by two British psychol-
' ogists indicates that the personal-
'~, ity traits of lung car~cer patients
~t ;Aiffer significantly from those of
people without cancer. The traits
t~n of lung cancer victims also differ
from the personality patterns of I
smokers studied, they said in an
article in the Journai of Psychosa
matic Research.
The findings suggest "there is
a true relationship between per-
sonality and cancer," the psychol&lt;
ogists said. "Lung cancer patients
do not appear to be a random~ se-
lection of cigarette smokers," they
reported.
In general, according to Drs.
David M. Kissen a n d H. J.
Eysenck, lung cancer patients
"have a significantly diminished
outlet for emotional discharge"
compared with non-cancer pa-

other hand, tend to be more out=` `
'
going - more extraverted -- than cancer victims and non-smokers
studied, they
said.
Another study, by a U. S. Pub a
lic Health Service scientist, indi-

cated that relatives of lung cancer `
patients have a significantly in.
creased risk of dying of lung can cer whether they smoke or not.
This familiar factor was more
marked among non-smokers, said .
Dr. George K. Toukhata in a pa- .~
;per presented before the Ameri ~
~ an Public Health Association fi~ f~,~
F The scientist investigated the ~~*t

causes of death among blood 're-
latives of 270 hing cancer victims
and compared them with the his-
tories of an equal number o f
healthy persons living in the
same neighborhoods, mostly in
the Baltimore area. He found that
lung cancer mortality was two to
2.5 times greater among the rela-
tives of patients than in the con-
trol group. When non-smokers
were studied separately, cancer
niartality among patients' rela-
tives was four times greater than
among the controls.
Dr. Tokuhata observed that "the
most plausible explanation for the
observed familiar aggregation of
lung cancer is in terms of genetic
factors."

&gt; -New Research Reports
On Lung Cancer Causes
New research reports indicate that
psychological and genetic factors may
;; provide important clues to the mys-
tery of lung cancer, according to To-
bacco and Health, a publication of the
Tobacco Institute, Inc. A study by two
Irit'ish psychologists indicates that the
personality traits of lung cancer pa-
tients differ significantly from those
of people without cancer. The traits
:; - of lung cancer victims also differ
from the personality patterns of smok-
ers studied, the psychologists reported
in the Journal of Psychosomatic Re-
search.
The findings suggest that "there is a
true relationship between personalitv
and cancer," the British experts said.
"Lung cancer patients do noU appear
to be a random selection of cigarette
' smokers."
In general, according to Drs. David
M. Kissen and H. J. Eysenck, lung
~ cancer patients "have a significantly
diminished' outlet for emotional dis-
charge" compared' with non-cancer
patients." Smokers studied, on the
__ other hand, tend to be more outgoing
-more extraverted-than cancer vic-
tims and non-smokers studied, they
said.
Another study, by a U. S. Public
Health Service scientist, indicated that
relatives of lung cancer patients have
a significantly increased risk of dying
of lung cancer whether they smoke
or not. This familiar factor was more
marked among non-smokers, said Dr.
George K. Tokahata in a paper pre-
sente&amp;before American Public Health
Association.
The scientist investigated the causes
of death among blood relatives of 270
lung cancer patients and compared
them with the histories of an equal
number of healthy persons living in
the same neighborhoods, mostly in
the Baltimore area. He found that lung
cancer mortality was 2 to 2.5 times
greater among relatives of patients
than in the control group. When non-
smokers were studied separately, can-
cer mortality among patient's relatives ' A high incidence of heart disease in
was four times greater than among ' a group of elderly tram drivers has

Sentries have no nicotine,.

vegetable fibers prepared ac-

can be eaten,. although they
are not likely to. make it big
as a delicacy. .
They smell like new-mown

uit Cigarettes

ecause Of E~r!y'Rebeffion
I have developed a theory
about the &amp;arette smokers
, who are able to quit and' those
who do not seem able to kick
the habit, even though they
would like to. , ;.. .
If a statistical study were
made of the successful swear-
er-offers, I believe it would
show that' these were the per-
sons who began smoking rela-
tively late in life for social
reasons of one sort'or another..
The real addicts - those
who know they should q u I t
but cannot bring themselves
to - would turn out to be, I
am convinced, those who be-
gan smoking at a compara-
tively early age for reasons
of defiance or rebellion
against their parents.
We k n o w that cigarette
smoking is not a physiological
addiction, in the way that dope
is; cigarettes do not set up in
the body an irresistible crav-
ing for tobacco. The addiction
to cigarettes is almost whollyy
psychological; the unconscious
mind is gripped by this source
of gratification. „
The type of =smoker who be-
gan at a relatively early age,
as a gest+ire of independence
toward his parents, c a n n o E
bring himself to quit because
quitting woul&amp; represent a re-
turn to the dependency of his
youth, would in some w a y
symbolize a retreat to the earl-
ier patterns of childhood.
* * *
THIS ALL MAY sound very
fancy and far-fetched, but how
else account for the psycholog-
ical addiction of cigarettes? If
some can quit, and others can-
not, there must be an uncon-
scious restraint blocking t h e
free will of those who would'
like to kick the habit but find
it impossible to do.
Smoking begins in m a n y
young people as a badge o f
adulthoodk as Oscar W'i l d ee
said of war, so long as it is
considered wicked it will be at-
tractive; when it is considered
merely vulgar it will lose its
appeal. Since smoking is con-
sidered (or was considered)
slightly wicked for children
by most parents, it was in-
vested with great attractive-
ness for them. •

If the child's conflict with
his parents-either on t h e
conscious or the unconscious
level-was deep a n d long-
standing, then the act o f
smoking came to represent
a rebellion agaiast' depen-
dency and a continuing reas-
surance that' the smoker is
a person in his own right.
I am as sure as I can br
without any statisticall proof
that young people whose rela-
tion with their parents a r e
sound and healthy either have
no desire to smoke, or if they
do smoke, are quite rationally
able to quit when confronted'
with the medicall evidence that
it is harmful to them.
Those who persist in smok-
ing in the face of svch evi-
dence are re-enacting daily the
adolescent act of defiance, and
are in bondage not so much
to the nicotine as to the unre-
solved conflicts in their early
family life.

Not even-the lung cancer reports ever stated'the case
against smoking more strongly. Throwing out most ot the
qualifying phrases, the American Heart Association yester-
day
da7 urged Americans to stop smoking because of the
danger of heart attacks and other, ecardiovascular disease.
s c. The warning to "the general public" came in a rea-
olution by the AssociaUon+s board of directors meeting
at the Plaza Hotel. This apparently ended a long debate
within the organlzatiolt over just how flatly to put It':
Iteportedly,the AHA had been on the verge of launch-
Itg a public campaign against cigarette smoking following
a study in 1960 that showed that smokers are in 50 to 150
percent greater danger of fatal hpart attacks than non-
smokers.
The three Yeara since then, reported a special AHA
v committee, have done nothing but pile up more evidence
: oonflrming the worst about smoking:
•"Furthermore:' said the committee. "no information
fias become available which contiadlcta or Invalidates the
f `1960 report."
+'- Officials of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee
`
.-_--spokesmen for the Industry in the scientific controversy-
1, y';~ `-:eouid not' be reached immediately for comment•
But: they weree almost certain to point, to one clause
In the ABA resolution, present In one form or another In
almost all damaging studies of cigarette amoking:
The clause reads: "Although the statistical assoeistlon
between heavy cigarette smoking and increased mortality
and morbidity from coronary heart disease do not prove
casual relationships. . . . " - -
- Tobacco men have said In the past: "Statistics never
killed anybody."
In the case of lung cancer It is usually assumed that'
cigarette amoke may injure lung tissues. But a biological
explanation for the link between heart ailments and ciga-
rette smoking has been missing,..

Not even-the lung cancer reports ever stated'the case
against smoking more strongly. Throwing out most ot the
qualifying phrases, the American Heart Association yester-
day
da7 urged Americans to stop smoking because of the
danger of heart attacks and other, ecardiovascular disease.
s c. The warning to "the general public" came in a rea-
olution by the AssociaUon+s board of directors meeting
at the Plaza Hotel. This apparently ended a long debate
within the organlzatiolt over just how flatly to put It':
Iteportedly,the AHA had been on the verge of launch-
Itg a public campaign against cigarette smoking following
a study in 1960 that showed that smokers are in 50 to 150
percent greater danger of fatal hpart attacks than non-
smokers.
The three Yeara since then, reported a special AHA
v committee, have done nothing but pile up more evidence
: oonflrming the worst about smoking:
•"Furthermore:' said the committee. "no information
fias become available which contiadlcta or Invalidates the
f `1960 report."
+'- Officials of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee
`
.-_--spokesmen for the Industry in the scientific controversy-
1, y';~ `-:eouid not' be reached immediately for comment•
But: they weree almost certain to point, to one clause
In the ABA resolution, present In one form or another In
almost all damaging studies of cigarette amoking:
The clause reads: "Although the statistical assoeistlon
between heavy cigarette smoking and increased mortality
and morbidity from coronary heart disease do not prove
casual relationships. . . . " - -
- Tobacco men have said In the past: "Statistics never
killed anybody."
In the case of lung cancer It is usually assumed that'
cigarette amoke may injure lung tissues. But a biological
explanation for the link between heart ailments and ciga-
rette smoking has been missing,..
- FourPhfladelphiadoctors.reported to,theAHAfn 1961
.. -thatt they may have found1t. They cited studies of heart'patlentk indicatingthatcigarette.smokingtriggers the re-

tends to harden and close up arteries.

'MESSENGER
Kadisanville, K3r,
'December 27, 1962
Toliacco.A Mainstav
'
,Of Family Farm
.0
Tobacco may be providing a last strong-
hold for the traditional "family farm" in the
United States--an institution which THE

MESSENGER hopes will never disappear.

Stephen E. Wrather, director of the tobac-
co division of the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture's marketing service, made the point
the other day that while other types of farms
are disappearing at' a rapid rate, uprooting
families they once supported, tobacco farms
have actually increased in number. This may
surprise some, but here are the figures:
Nearly 3,000,000 farms have disap-
peared since 1919, about 45 per cent of
the total. In 1919 there were 6,500,000
U.S.' farms. Last year there were only
3,800,000.
Tobacco farms meanwhile have reg-
istered a gain of 2'1,000 in number since
1919-from 496,000 that year to 517;
000 now.
' The decline im farms, Director Wrather
pointed out in his piece in TOBACCO NEWS,
has been steady except for a slight upturn
from 1928 to 1935,. when the depression
brought about a return to the land. After
that the downturn began at a heavier pace
than ever as farmers moved to cities for-
jobs in business and industry.
Nearly all types of farms have been af-
fected. Here are a few examples of the de-
ani~~. -
clines among farms for the major cash crops,
from 1919 to 1959:
Corn farms dropped' in number frotn
4,900,000 to 1,900,000. '
Wheat farms declined from 2,200,-
000 to 931,000.
Cotton farms are down from 1,900,-
000 to 499,540.
Sugar beet farms dropped from 47,-
000 to 23,700.
. Among the major cash crops, only
s+oybean andJ'Kobaoco farms have shown
+ We are glad the USDA man mentioned
soybeans, which have come to be a most im=
portant crop in our own county and 'section.
The rise in soybean farms came with dis-
covery of new product uses for the beans,
such as soybean oils for food products and
paints. We have 'never 'been able to find out
if it is trae or not, but we were told once
upon a time that bugles; evesi, 'are made of
.`soybeans, and such a development would cer-
tainly be.no miracle in these days when good
old soft coal can be turned into a vast var- `-
iety of things other than fuel, and when a
lowly strawpile is scanned with eager eye
- by chemists and engineers and such, look-
ing for possible new uses.

• In his piece in TOBACCO NEWS, in which
I he accented the tobacoo angle rather than
•the soybean angle. Mr. Wrather allowed that
the movement away from the farm to the
'nity results largeiy, from changes in farm
technology and "better employment oppor-
tunities in busuiess and industry," though it
should be said that niany who quit the farm
and flock into the Big Town for job oppor-
tunity niee[• cC"~sapliointment ana 3ometaYUca
. frustration.
'In terms of people who man the farms,'
. there was a drop of' 4,000.000 or so from
'1950 to 1958, as has been reported many
times since, and commonly it is said that
mechanization, better seed and fertilizer and
improved methods have all contributed to
the drop in manpower needed in farming.
.On the other hand, rapidly-expanding in-
dustry has required more manpower in years
gone by, yet in this area, too, we find changes.
Mechanization has advanced rapidly in most
lines, automation has replaced men with ma-
chines, and if the signs do not deceive every-
body, the role of the modern miracle machine
will grow, larger and larger as the years go„
by.
In the farming process, Director Wrather
points out, tobacco remains a hand-tailored
operation, compared with other major cash
crops. It requires more man-hours of per-
sonal attention than any other, and in har-.
Yesting; the situation is different from wheat,
corn, soybeans and such. where machinery
does most of the work. With tobacco, the
leaves must be picked by hand. at just the
right tisi}te, and inciividual plants niay be
rhecked a iralf-dozen times or more to inake
sure t ie leaves are ripe.
Still, while per.sonal attention is still the
byword forr the tobacco farmer, improved
methods and equipment have enabled him to
get bigger crop yields and a higher cash re-
turn per acre.
The TOBACCO NEWS piece pointed out
that the number of farm families who depend
on tobacco runs a good deal higher than the
actual number of tobacco farms, since medi-
um-size and larger acreage allotments con-
tribute to the support of two, three or more
tenant families. A11 in all, the piece asserts,
the historical place of tobacco in American
agriculture is expected to remain stable,
which is a hope w-lrich a lot of Hopkins coun-
tians will share. for tobacco is still an im-
portant crop in our farm economy.

In the January 5 issue of America, Father Neil
•
- New York's City College, had arrived at a similar con-

editors of Main Events, the evening-session weekly at
cotic dream with an inexcusable dosage of dishonesty."
•hairy hands; the attitude of complacency and apparent
lack of atvuety - isn't this the typical TV approach
for much cigarette advertising? It is basically a nar-
society setting; the rich, rough scion with the tattooed,
Hurley let loose at cigarette advertising. The most suc-
cessful campaigns, he suggested, ". . . are those that
-• overwhelm the senses. The sultry woman's voice; the
ed to print this paper." They appealed to the student
body'and the faculty, to President Buell G. Gallagher
and campus organizations, for help. "We want to ex-
put out three issues - and had been unable to find
other sources of income to offset the deficit. "Whether
we like it or not," they wrote, "we depend upon this
advertising for nearly 50 per cent of the revenue need-
. they had lost $800 in advertising revenue - enough to
throwing out cigarette advertising.
Shortly the editors received an economic lesson, the
gist of which they no doubt foresaw. By December 10,
that same issue, Main Events announced that it was
ERS?"' To smoke Luckies, of course ="Lucky Strike,
the favorite regular cigarette of college students." In
that they coul&amp; no longer abet' the forming of the habit
.,Uy printing cigarette advertising. In their October 29
issue, they ran a Lucky Strike ad covering about two-
thirds of a page, starting with a prize contest and end-
ing with: "The question is: IF SOCRATES WERE
ALIVE TODAY, WHAT WOULD HE ADVISE SMOI:-
clusion. Convinced that cigarette smoking damages
the lungs, heart and other organs, the editors decided
press our deep regrets," they wrote "that the circum-
stances which make necessary the financial integrity
of this paper - and apparently many other school
papers across the country- must, to such a large ex-
tent, rely upon a product which, according to the evi-
dence, contributes so greatly to the death of thousands
every year."
Apparently Main Events is the first college paper to
discontinue cigarette advertising on the initiative of
the staff. So far it has been able to scrounge along. If
it survives despite its admirably independent editorial
policy, the fact will be widely noted. If it folds, like-
wise. Surely the City College administration, to the
extent that it can give aid, should do so, for what is
at issue is not merely the existence of'one college pa-
per. Rather, the vaunted editorial independence of the
grcat' American press is here being tcstcd, and the
fact that the test is on a small and local scale does not
alter t;ie ;moived.

DESERT NEWS
Salt Lake City, Utah
.
Curtail The 'Coffin Nail'
SMOHING IS. A foolish, harmful habit-
arid o~"ffunately more and more people
are coming to realize it.
At' the risk of causing embarrassment
by naming names, we would like to sug-
gest that the nation's airlines and rail-
roads should, logically, be the next ones
to join the growing movement to curtaill
smoking by ceasing to supply free
samples.
If they do so they will be in good com-
pany. Only i•ecently the government of
Canada decided to urge its citizens not to
smoke on the grounds that "overwhelm-
ing evidence shows a direct relationship
between cigarette smoking and lung
cancer."
A courageous move was taken by the
Wisconsin State Board of Health when it
advised high school students not' to smoke
even though such anti-smoking publicity
may be why the state's anticipated reve-
nues from cigarette taxes are expected to
fall short of expectations by some
$500,000.
The same kind of moral responsibility
also has been shown by LeRoy Collins,
president of the National Association of
Broadcasters. Even though the broadcast-
ing Industry brought In $134 million from
tobacco advertising last year, Mr. Collins
has urged that cigarette commercials be
brought within the purview of the NAB
code of good practice. As he put it, "If we
are honest with ourselves, we cannot ig~
norc the mounting evidencp that tobacco
provides a serious hazard to health."
So what can the airlines and railroads
do about this? They can follbw the ex-
ample the U.S. Air Force already is set-
ting and stop giving away free cigarettes
to their patrons. ,
. From the health viewpoint, there's
nothing really free about the cigarettes
they give away - unless you consider
"free" cancer and "free" respiratory
troubles a boon.
Moreover, since it costs the airlines
and railroads money to furnish these free
cigarettes,, they might even add to their
profits by cutting out the free smokes.
THE ADVICE APPLIES to everyone:
Don't smoke and don't' encourage.
others to do so. You'll be doing yourself
a favor.

Dr. Richard H. Overholt has a

;~
-' casual visitor at Overholt's
' ultra-modern building in Bos

around his reception room aree
little signs with a common
message:
"No smoking."
The 61-year-old Overholt is

thousands of reasons, every

7ersity of Nebraska- Medical

ie operates the Overholt Tho-

ather doctors. Some are being
;rained by the clinic in heart
' _ and lung operations. Overholt-
trained surgeons are now in
many parts of the world.

about 95 per cent of those who

the heart, are smokers. It is a1-
most never found in the non-

CREDENTIALS IMPRESSIVE
"Lung cancer and its con-
nection with s mo k i n g get
much of the publicity," he
said. "AGtually the relation be-

ya~
or more times a day. ~~`~4-~._',~~.%

"About 10 per cent of these' "

doctor said. "Well, over 90 per

A survey, among doctors re-

DESERT NEWS
Salt Lake City, Utah
.
Curtail The 'Coffin Nail'
SMOHING IS. A foolish, harmful habit-
arid o~"ffunately more and more people
are coming to realize it.
At' the risk of causing embarrassment
by naming names, we would like to sug-
gest that the nation's airlines and rail-
roads should, logically, be the next ones
to join the growing movement to curtaill
smoking by ceasing to supply free
samples.
If they do so they will be in good com-
pany. Only i•ecently the government of
Canada decided to urge its citizens not to
smoke on the grounds that "overwhelm-
ing evidence shows a direct relationship
between cigarette smoking and lung
cancer."
A courageous move was taken by the
Wisconsin State Board of Health when it
advised high school students not' to smoke
even though such anti-smoking publicity
may be why the state's anticipated reve-
nues from cigarette taxes are expected to
fall short of expectations by some
$500,000.
The same kind of moral responsibility
also has been shown by LeRoy Collins,
president of the National Association of
Broadcasters. Even though the broadcast-
ing Industry brought In $134 million from
tobacco advertising last year, Mr. Collins
has urged that cigarette commercials be
brought within the purview of the NAB
code of good practice. As he put it, "If we
are honest with ourselves, we cannot ig~
norc the mounting evidencp that tobacco
provides a serious hazard to health."
So what can the airlines and railroads
do about this? They can follbw the ex-
ample the U.S. Air Force already is set-
ting and stop giving away free cigarettes
to their patrons. ,
. From the health viewpoint, there's
nothing really free about the cigarettes
they give away - unless you consider
"free" cancer and "free" respiratory
troubles a boon.
Moreover, since it costs the airlines
and railroads money to furnish these free
cigarettes,, they might even add to their
profits by cutting out the free smokes.
THE ADVICE APPLIES to everyone:
Don't smoke and don't' encourage.
others to do so. You'll be doing yourself
a favor.

provide the goods and services
that are necessary for any major
industry.
We can also prediet that taxes
levied on tobacco products willi
continue to provide a major
source of income for federal, state
and local governments.
In addition, we must anticipate
continued widespread discussion
of tobacco and health, Much of
this discussion will tend to be
oversimplified as it has been in
the past, and this may make it
difficult'to separate facts from the-
ories.
Despite this, however, we can
be confident that' in 1963 scien-
tists will continue to make new
findings and achieve a greater
understanding of earlier researrh
work. This will in turn bring
about a better perspective of tho,e
diseases with which smoking has
sometimes been statistically asso-
ciated, and also of the various faa
tors and conditions that may be
involved in the development of
those diseases.
This conviction is our hope for
the future and our guide for the
~ present.
During 1963, the Surgeon Gen-
eral's Advisory Committee on
Smoking and Health will review
existing knowledge about smok-
ing and health. Our industry is co-
operating with this group in the
hope that it will be a thorough
study and, as the Surgeon Gen-
eral has said, "will be concerned
~also much that remains to be donee
before scientists learn the answers
, to the health problems involved.
This is the objective of the to-
bacco industry-to find the an-
swers.
It is unreasonable to expect any
group of men, however competent
and wise, to be able to give finali
answers, on the basis of existingg
data, to questions about the causa-
tion of such diseases as lung can-
cer. . .
We in the tobacco industry rec-.
ognize a special responsibility to
:help science determine the facts.
And we believe we are fulfilling
this responsibility throtlgh~ the To-
bacco Industry Researcti Commit-
tee, which is supported by mem-
bers of the Tobacco Institute, and
also by growers and warehouse-
men;
The T.I.R.C. was formed some-
eight,years ago and' has been dili-
gently supporting the work of
inclependrr:t scientists ever sinre.
Over the years, the research
supported by T.I.R.C., and by
many other private and public re-
search groups, has brought about
a broader scientific understand-
ing of the smoking queslion~
and, more importantly, a broader
understanding of the development
of diseases such as lung cancer.
Research has steadily broaden-
ed the factors under study and to-
day they include, in addition to
smoking, viruses, heredity, previ-
ous lung infections, environmental
pollutants, constitutional and psy-
ctiological differences.
This N not to sug,cst that smok-
ing shoit)d not be inveslk*ati'd fur-
The tobacco industry's position
is based on two sound princip;es:
1. The causes of lungcanuer are
not now known to science. Many
factors are being studied, along
with tobacco. The case against
tobacco is based largely on statis-
tical association studies,,the mean-
ings of which are in dispute.
: 2. The millions who gain their
livelihood from tobacco are vital-
ly interested in finding out the
full!facts: They have a double in-
terest: as good citizens and as
members of a major industry. To-
bacco people actually took the
lead in seeking the answers by
setting up the T.I.R.C. and turn-
ing over full control of its research
program to a group of outstand-
ing, independent scientists.
Those of us who believe in the
industry, and in the integrity of
its position, have a firm responsi-
bility to help~ make this position
understood.
What can we do?
We must first recognize that
this is an age when the "simple"
answer far too often gains ac-
ceptance through repetition.
We must' equip ourselves with
the-facts so that we can contrib-
ute knowledge and understanding,
ttfiich in the long run will outlive
the "simple" answers.
If we do this, we can indeed face
the future with confidence.
During the -past year„ which
marked the 350th anniversary of
the tobacco industry in the U.S.,
our industry continued to grow
and prosper. Here are some of the
1962 results:
Cigarette sales in the UtS. (in-
cluding the armed forces over-
seas) reached 510 billion cigar-
ettes, 8 billion more than in 1961
and 26 billion more than in 1960.
Consumers spent about $6.9 bil-
lion for cigarettes in 1962, up over
$200 million. Spending for all to-
bacco products totaled $7.8 bil-
lion, up $200 million.
Nearly half of what consumeu,
paid for cigarettes in 1962 was for
federal, state and local excise
: taxes, the Tobacco Tax Council
reports: Taxes on cigarettes are
estimated at $3.1 billion, about
$100 million higher than in 1961,'
Taxes on other tobacco products*
totaled $100 million. Cigarette tax-
es have gone up about $1 billiorr
in the last 10 years, according to
the Tax Council.
The U.S. continued to be the
world's leading exporter of cig- •
arettes, which are goodwill am sU;
bassadors around the world. Ship 4
ments abroad totaled 23.3 billior ~l*x
cigarettes, five per cent above
1961. Exports have gone up stead
ily since 1930 and this year were `
valued at over $100 million, com-
pared with $68 million five years
ago. In addition, exports of leaf
tobacco totaled 480 million pounds
export weight. Leaf exports were
valued' at $385 million.
U.S. farmers grew some 2.3 bil-

It's called "Sentry," and -It'
was introduced to Washingtod
iat a Mayflower Hotel press
'conference yesterday ln an

feel •. toward tobacco, with
cigar, cigarette and p i p e
smoke. " •
Sentries have no nicotine,.
rno coumarin, no arsenic, no
: glycol or glycerine and `no- tobacco. They are made from
vegetable fibers prepared ac-
cording to a recipe kept a
closel,y-guarded secret, like the
formula for Coca Cola. They
can be eaten,. although they
are not likely to. make it big
as a delicacy. .
They smell like new-mown
bay and may taste like It, for
all .• anybody. at yesterday's
press luncheon knew. Re-
porters were present who had
a m o k e d everything else,
though - cornsilk,. c o f f e e
grounds, sage brush and even
shredded newspapers. .
Sentries are made by Notob
Products, Inc. Bantob;, No-
tob's predecessor, went bank-
rupt in 1960 producing a veg-
etable-fibre cigarette. Gerald
U. Schaflander was president
)ife, and is also president of
Notob.
"Yes, smoking our product,
too,. Is potentially harmful,"
Schaflander said yesterday.
"We feel smoking is harmful,
period:"But vegetable fiber
is to tobacco as a glass of
fresh milk is to a draught of
hemlock, his arguments sug-
gested.
Schaflander fell out of favor
with men who know tobacco
best when he set up Bantob
in~ 1959: "The Tobacco Leaf,"
~ Industry organ, took note
I6f the venture and expressed
fears that it would only en,
courage "modern - day anti-
bacs." . . i'
As an antibac, SchaflanderA`
said he -has found it difficult
to place advertisements, buy
machinery . and find retail
outlets. He has lined -.up a,
few West Coast health stores ":.
and a few other small stores, `
but may eventually be-forced,
to sell Sentries door to door. -
"
The Sentry slogan, which "`
Schaflander confidently pre-
dicts almost no one will ever ','
see in an ad, is "How to give _
up tobacco without giving up
smokingl Smoke Sentry." He,
does not call Sentries ciga-
rettes. He calls them smokes.

A 3i mim of Chicago medical in-
vestigatorti, reporting their latest
results in a long-term study of the
development of coronary heart di-
.sease in an industrial population,
produced some surprises.
Coronary disease, marked by an
accumulation of fatty deposits in
the walls of the blood vessels nour-
ishing ithe heart muscle, sets the
itago for most heart attacks.
Presenting their findings among
approximately 2,000, middle-aged
men employed' by aAChicago man-
ufacturing company, Dr. Oglesby.
Paul; former president of the Am-
erican Heart assn., said there were
mo significant differences in diet
among the individuals who devel-
oped coronary disease during the
past 41 , ~ years and those who did
not.
Of 89 new cases of coronary
disease devc•loping in the study
popultition (at' an average rate of
20 per ycar), there were just about
•the same number among those who
habitually ate the least fat as
among those who ate the most.
Other Factors
Other dio.ary factors - includ-
ing total caloric intake, consump-
tion of carbohydrates, protein, an-
imal! fat vegetable fat, cholesterol,
saturated or unsaturated fatty
'acids-also could not bc related
to the occurrence of now cases of.
coronary disease.
Neit her could alcohol consump-
tion or type of work performed
by the individual.
Factors that did appear to be
related, according to Dr. Pau9; a
former vice president of the Chi-
cago Heart assn., include cigar-
ette smoking, tendency to increas-
ed heart rate, hypei+tension (high
blood pressure), high blood choles-
terol levels and certain psycholo-
gicall traits.
Dr. Paul added that the study
had also failed to confirm the
widespread view that individuals
with athletic muscular (mesomor-
phic) builds are more heart dis-
case prorje than others.
Sitidy Of 1!100 Men
These evaluations were drawnn
from a comprehensive study of
1999 men: a~-cd 40 to 55, and selec-
ted at random. The participants,
Dr.' Paul obsccved, were testetl
psychological7y, had their medical
histories and dietary habits an--
alyzed and have undergone peri-
odic physical examinations.
As new cases of coronary dis-
ease devcloped, the individuals in-
volred were, stndied for factors
Rhat might differentiate them
from the larger non-coronary pop-
ulation. The study Is seheduled to
continue for several years more.
The finding that there appeared
to be no connection between diet .
and coronarv heart disease comes
in the midst of a major medical
dii:cussion iweighing the pros and
cons of controlled fat diets in rthe
prevention and treatment of heart .
disease. A,
Cholesterol
In general, the purpose of such ~
diets has been to lower blood chol.
esterol, since high levels of this
fatty substance in the blood have
been consistently associated with
greater susceptibility to coronary
disease. :. '
This observation was confinned
in the Chicago study, which also,.:
found that the men dying from.'
coronary heart disease averaged
.the highest blood levels of choles-
terol and that those w h o had•d
heart attackg but survived had, on .
Ehe average, lower leveis. Lowei'
still was the average of the men
who have not developed coronary
heart disease.
It is evident, however, that diet-
ary ary fat Intake is not the sole.fac-
tor controlling blood cholesterol
levels. Dr. Paul explained: "We
believe coronary heart disease to
be related to a combination of
factors. In our study, it is clearly
easier to associate this condition
cvith the use of cigarettes and high,
blood pressure thafi a th diet. .
This study is one of the 47 re-
search projeots currently receiving
support from the Chicago Heart
assn. and its Heart Councils.

A 3i mim of Chicago medical in-
vestigatorti, reporting their latest
results in a long-term study of the
development of coronary heart di-
.sease in an industrial population,
produced some surprises.
Coronary disease, marked by an
accumulation of fatty deposits in
the walls of the blood vessels nour-
ishing ithe heart muscle, sets the
itago for most heart attacks.
Presenting their findings among
approximately 2,000, middle-aged
men employed' by aAChicago man-
ufacturing company, Dr. Oglesby.
Paul; former president of the Am-
erican Heart assn., said there were
mo significant differences in diet
among the individuals who devel-
oped coronary disease during the
past 41 , ~ years and those who did
not.
Of 89 new cases of coronary
disease devc•loping in the study
popultition (at' an average rate of
20 per ycar), there were just about
•the same number among those who
habitually ate the least fat as
among those who ate the most.
Other Factors
Other dio.ary factors - includ-
ing total caloric intake, consump-
tion of carbohydrates, protein, an-
imal! fat vegetable fat, cholesterol,
saturated or unsaturated fatty
'acids-also could not bc related
to the occurrence of now cases of.
coronary disease.
Neit her could alcohol consump-
tion or type of work performed
by the individual.
Factors that did appear to be
related, according to Dr. Pau9; a
former vice president of the Chi-
cago Heart assn., include cigar-
ette smoking, tendency to increas-
ed heart rate, hypei+tension (high
blood pressure), high blood choles-
terol levels and certain psycholo-
gicall traits.
Dr. Paul added that the study
had also failed to confirm the
widespread view that individuals
with athletic muscular (mesomor-
phic) builds are more heart dis-
case prorje than others.
Sitidy Of 1!100 Men
These evaluations were drawnn
from a comprehensive study of
1999 men: a~-cd 40 to 55, and selec-
ted at random. The participants,
Dr.' Paul obsccved, were testetl
psychological7y, had their medical
histories and dietary habits an--
alyzed and have undergone peri-
odic physical examinations.
As new cases of coronary dis-
ease devcloped, the individuals in-
volred were, stndied for factors
Rhat might differentiate them
from the larger non-coronary pop-
ulation. The study Is seheduled to
continue for several years more.
The finding that there appeared
to be no connection between diet .
and coronarv heart disease comes
in the midst of a major medical
dii:cussion iweighing the pros and
cons of controlled fat diets in rthe
prevention and treatment of heart .
disease. A,
Cholesterol
In general, the purpose of such ~
diets has been to lower blood chol.
esterol, since high levels of this
fatty substance in the blood have
been consistently associated with
greater susceptibility to coronary
disease. :. '
This observation was confinned
in the Chicago study, which also,.:
found that the men dying from.'
coronary heart disease averaged
.the highest blood levels of choles-
terol and that those w h o had•d
heart attackg but survived had, on .
Ehe average, lower leveis. Lowei'
still was the average of the men
who have not developed coronary
heart disease.
It is evident, however, that diet-
ary ary fat Intake is not the sole.fac-
tor controlling blood cholesterol
levels. Dr. Paul explained: "We
believe coronary heart disease to
be related to a combination of
factors. In our study, it is clearly
easier to associate this condition
cvith the use of cigarettes and high,
blood pressure thafi a th diet. .
This study is one of the 47 re-
search projeots currently receiving
support from the Chicago Heart
assn. and its Heart Councils.

smog is a world-wide
grace. At this writing it'
,_ is unknown what the ulti-
mate death toll will be in
"r •the, disastrous blanket of
: foul atmosphere that set-
, tied down over London
i ~ last week.
In October, 1948, the
western Pennsylvania mill
town of Donora was
caught in the grip of a
killer smog, and 20 died of
acute cardio-respiratory dis-
tress. Since 6000 became ill
at tllC same time, it is fair
to assume that the real
death toll ultimately was
much higher.
IN SPITE of the dra-
: matic impact of such epi-
: sodes as London a n d
Donora, there Is little doubt
that the chronic effects of
air pollution kre much
' more serious than the short
term effects. Lung cancer
seems clearly associated,
and, careful autopsies of
the Donora victims indi-
cated that no organ of the
body is immune to air
pollution disease.
Air pollution is not con-
fined to centers of heavy
' Andustry." New York has
little' heavy industry, but
its atmosphere is chronical-
ly foul. Here; as In LQs
Angeles, autos and buses
a r e principal . offenders.
Only an accident of atmos-
pherics has saved New
York from sharing Los
Angeles' fate as a city
Khich is intermitItly al-
light. ; .
But the biggest element
was the fact that the air was
clean-the eternal blanket
of airborne filth that hovers
over all our cities was not
there, and heaven itself
seemed to be celebrating.
WP -had left New Yo kr
the day previously, taking
off just an hour before fog
had combined with the in-
evitable air pollution to
obscure a runway and claim
the lives of 25 air crash
victims. So accustomed
were we to the nasty air
!-. we breathe that neither
'^^--of us found the weather
remarkable.
BUT. IT OCCURRED to '
me, after the crash and'
after Chip's dramatic reac-
tion to the beauty_ of a
night sky in the mountains,
that we have systematically
set about destroying the
very air our children
breathe.
In common.with all par-
ents, I have nagged my
sons to avoid cigarets. But,
again like everyone else,
I've done nothing to end
the poisoning of the atmos-
phere that gives us life.
i arets may well be
guil y as c ged, but lit-
tle public notice is taken
of an even more ominous
statistic - lung cancer is '
twice as frequent among „

most uninhabitable due to
mo
g.
s
The discourag~ng thing
about the battle agaiast
smog is the fact that we
have most of the weapons
we need to win It but ars
generally prevented from
using them by public
apathy and the opposition
of vested interests.
Air pollution control Is
expensive, and it probably
won't be done on a suf-
ficiently large scale until
many more Donoras and
Londons have taken their
tolli of human life, and of
generations of children who
have never really seen the
sky.

• However, unlike many major

~ preaching against' tobacco, one

i big communion, the . Methodist
Church, still retains an old rule
on the matter: No smoking for

"The Metllodist position on the

because it dray-s its strength

Some other, church bodies, in-

Hazards of Judging
Next to the . heavy smokers them-
selves, doctors are the most concerned
about whether cigarettes are a hazard
to health. Yet while the controversy has
boiled for years, it was not until its last
annual meeting that the American Medi-
cal Association got into the fray. At that
time, the AMA voted to appoint a spe-
cial committee of "impartial"' experts to
Ceview•w the evidence linking cigarettes
to lung cancer and other diseases. Last
week, the AMA dropped the project.
The reason: no impartial scientists could
be found.
About 150 possible panel members
:r.were considered during the past nine
months, said an AMA spokesman, "but
every one was solidly pro or con," T he.
AMA also noted that a study of the.
~ cigarette-health question is already
under way by a ten-man committee ap-
\ pointed by Surgeon General Luther L.
M Terry. (This panel, composed of scien-
tists tists who have never taken a public

George V. Allen's speech before the North Carolina Bankers Association-an
the election of Frank J. Welch as executive vice president of the Tobacco
Institute received press notice. A selection from the coverage is shown.
George V. Allen, president of the
Tobar.co Institute, Inc., is complain-
ing that the European Common Mar-
ket countries have "shown no sign
of a liberal trade policy for tobac-
CO."
That's another way of saying that
the duties imposed on American to-
bacco by the European "Big Six"
are too high+ . • . ; ', I
Matter of fact is that the United
States no longer is the only substan-
tial producer of quality tobacco in
the world. African countries pro-
duce the golden weed in a quality
which approaches our own, and pro-
duce it at a cost far under that con-
fronting the American tobacco grow-
er.
On top of that there is our own
control policy directed' at giving the
American grower enough for his
tobacco to enable him to maintain
a high standard of living.
This is done by deliberately reduc-
ing acreage and by putting a high
loan support flbor under the price of
tobacco as marketed in this coun-
try.
Domestically this is sensible and
": not ruinous either to the grower or
;' the smoker. By far the biggest item
.: in the cost of a package of American
' cigarettes is state and federal taxes,
not the cost of the raw material.
But companies which export to-
bacco buy it at support prices from
the tobacco growers, which means
that foreign tobacco buyers have to
f ~y the same prices that domestic
uyers have to pay. They not only
have to pay the American. support
price but they have to pay the tar-
iffs tbese countries place on Amer-
ican tobaccos, because the American
government places tariffs on the
things the y m'ake and export to
Americ$.
. One might suggest that a solution -
be found in applying the same for-
mula to tobacco that we apply to
cotton: sell it to the foreign market
at several cents a pound under what
we sell it to the domestic market,
with the government subsidizing the
difference.
Cotton manufacturers complain
that this system enables foreign tex-
tile mills to buy American cotton,
process it with cheap labor, and
then fire it back to American to com-
pete with the products of American
textile mills.
But one could hardly expect this
to happen in the matter of cigarettes.
After all the United States gpvern-
ment does not operate under the
theory that wearing a shirt is a sin
and therefore should be heavily tax-
ed. But it does, and has for years
adopte&amp;this attitude toward tobacco.
Even if we granted foreign pur-
chasers of tobacco subsidies similar
to the cotton subsidy, we could cx-
pect our own domestic iax on tobac-
co to discourage too much compe-
tition from foreign-made cigarettes
in this country.
When yott buy cigarettes in the
United States you are not just pur-
chasing a smoke, you are paying
taxes through the nose.

:During the Coming Year?
nning to Quit Smoking-
By LLOYD L. HUNTINGTON

AII over the country at this moment there are thou-
eands of people who are solemnly pledging themselves
to. the New Year's resolution that "I'li stop smoking.° :,
Now there are -dozens of ways in which you can quit:
I knoR+ people that have tried them all.
'It Costs Too Much'

For example, there's the guy who always tells you liow'
'much it costs to smoke. He's a two•pack-a•day man who
quickly ealcu,lates that he's spending something like $300
' a year for cigarettes. "That's too much," he shouts, and
;' then proceeds to start the arduous task of quitting. The
first day he sticks solemnly to his goal. No cigarette
when he gets up in the morning. No cigarette after break-
fast. About 10 o'clock he's feeling real virtuous. He's also
nervous, a bit dizzy and finds he's having'diffficuity con-
centrating on his business. He sees other people smoking.'
!'Man, It smells good;" he says to himself. "Maybe I'll
have just' one." He smokes the one cigarette, then cheats
a bit and has another after lunch. Still feeling virtuous
he tells all of his friends about his feat. But as the after-
poon wears on his body cries out for that cigarette. His
friends shy away; he's irritable. His work is undone;
• he's too dizzy. And when. finally he drags himself home
'in the evening the wife and kids get on his nerves; the
tension is unbearable.
he Curious World
`I t's T oo Great a~hock'
"11Lybe I shouldn't quit: all at once," the poor patient
tells himself: "It's too great a shock to my system. Wny
I've been smoking for more than 20 years." He suc-
cumbs to this sort of rationalization and lights up a cig-
arette. Then after dinner, he puifs on another. Still ir-
resolute, he holds off until bedtime before again succum•
bing to the temptation to smoke. Well, after all, it's been
a pretty good day. He's had only five or six cigarettes
whereas he formerly would have smoked two packs. in .
the same amount of time.
The next day his will power is weakening a. bit. He be
gins rationalizing. The cost Isn't too great. After all, he
can pay for the cigarettes by cutting down on some of
those trips he's been taking, or by giving up that twice-
a-day coffee break. In a year's time the cost will about
average out. Happy now that he's found a solution to the
cost factor our friend spreads out' his cigarettes and
happily returns to his two-pack-a-day routine. Once in a
while his conscience will pain him a bit when he realizes
he really hasn't cut out anything to pay for his cigar
ettes. But next New Year's he'll give up something else.-
his cigarettes are here to stay.
`Not Good for Your Health'
Then there are the people who quit smoking because .'
of that' uneasy feeling that it can't possibly be good for
. their health. In fact, they become convinced that smoking
is - downright dangerous. "It's senseless," they say, "to
. keep poisoning your whole body. Smoking causes all
„ sorts of ailments. It increases the risk from illnesses ,
you already have." ':
Virtuously, they, too, resolve to quit. They store up a
supply of chewing gum, candy mints, peanuts, patent
medicines that are guaranteed to curb the desire for
cigarettes, and'-go to work. These people seem to get
along better. They're making fine progress for a while.
Then one day they realize that their weight Is creeping
up, first 10 pounds, then 15 pounds, then 25 pounds. :
"Better keep that weight down," the doe tells them.
`Too much weight puts a strain on the heart.": . ~. .:'.
"Well, I might as well die from smoking as from a
heart attack," they say. So back to the cigarettes. Every
once in a while they'll read something somewhere that
makes. smoking sound pretty dangerous. But they'll smile
knowingly - and keep on puffing away. ,,
.`T he I nescapable Conwlusion' -
There are a lot' of other categories of people who quit
smoking..There's the "mind•over•matter" Individual who
says he can quit whenever he wants to simply by telling
himself that he's stronger than any cigarette. This sys-
tem works for, a few, but the vast majority who try it
soon find they've vastly underestimated the strength of
that tiny cigarette.
Then there are the ones who fall ill and cigarettes be•
come unbearable during that illness. "I'll stay quit'," they
say, "now that I've gone this long without smokingl" But
on their first well day they find themselves reaching
again for that handy pack of cigarettes. And man,. that
smoke never tasted so good!
.
You could take the case history of each Individual who'a -
vowed at one time or another to quit smoking and, re-
gardless of the reason he decided to quit, you'd come up
with the inescapable conclusion - most of us are smok-
ing more - and enjoying It more.
Happy New Year!

WASHINGTON (AP) - Tobac-
co growing is fast becoming the
"last stronghold of the family
farm" in the United States, saysi
l
an Agriculture Department offi-
cial.
While nearly three million in-
dividual family farms have dis-
appeared from the scene in the
past 43 years, the number of to-
bacco farms actually has in-
creased, said StepliemE. Wrather,
director of the Tobacco Division
of the department's Agricultural
Marketing Service.
"The historical place of tobacco
in American agriculture is expect-
ed. to remain stable," he writes
In the 'trade publication Tobacco
News.
have declmed from 4.9 mrllron to
1.9 million and wheat farms from
2.2 million to 931,000.
Resisted Trend
Tobacco farming has resisted
the trend toward elimination of
small farms despite production
costs that run about five times
that of cotton and more than 11
times corn production costs, he
wrote.
The reason: said Wrather, is
that' tobacco "is a hand-tailored
operation" requiring more person-
al attention than any other crops
and gives a higher cash return
to the farmer.
The only other cash crop that
has shown an increase while the
number of f a r m s generally
dropped about 45 per cent in the
past four decades is soybeans,
Wrather saidi
5th Cash Crop
Wrather cited North Carolina,
the top tobacco-growing state, as
an example. "From 1949 to 19f1
the number of tobacco farms rose
from 129.850 to 131,070; a gaiu of
1,220," he said. In the same state,
the overall farm total dropped'
from 301,000 to 205,000, •he said.
While tobacco farms are gener-
ally small, averaging a little less
than three acres, the leaf is the
nation's fifth lbrtticsl cash crop
and third largest export crop,
Wrather noled:
And althnuuli few farmers relv

solely on tobacco, it' is' the''cas
mainstay for many.
.
famdtesw
"The number of farm
who depend on tobacco runs:a
good deal higher than the actual"
count of tobacco farms ' Wrathcr~;
said.
^'
Agriculture Department figure~~,~,
place the number of families whci;
get a"significanE part" of' their'&gt;
income from tobacco at 7U0.OOn: `
Wrather wrote
.
Tobacco is grown in 21 states'
from as far north as Connecticut
to as far south as Florida, Wrath=r,j
er noted; The leaders, in order, r
are North Carolina. Kentucky,.ry,
'
Virginia• South Carolina, Georgitt,
and Tennessee. ray`
"In many of these states, to-:'
Tobacco farms have increased bacco is among the top txo or'
from 496,009 to SI7;1100 since 1919; three casli crops," Wrather said '
•
Wrather said, while corn farms i, Although indications are that ;
"fewer and fewer families will
earn a living from the land." to-
bacco is expected to hold its own
in this respect for many years in .

the future, he added.
No Adaption q
T o b a c c o' s inadaptability to
mechanization, the major cause of
elimination of small family farms,
is one reason, Wrather said.
He said a study by North Car
olina's Department of Agriculture ~
ishowed flue-cured tobacco' re-•,
Iquires about 4% hours per acre
on a small family farm, com-
pared with about 29 hours for
corn and onty five hours for
wheat.
But, he added. "while personal
attention is still the byword' for
the tobacco fa,rmer, improved
methods and, equipment havee
enabled hinm to get bigger crop
yields and a higher cash return
per acre."
Another reason for the stability
of tobacco farming shows up in.
the government's handling of
farm surpluses. Wrather saiit. Sur-
pluses mean "substantial outlays
for some crops," he said, but "not
so with tobacco. Supplyy and de-
mand have remained fairly even
over the years."

George V. Allen's speech before the North Carolina Bankers Association-an
the election of Frank J. Welch as executive vice president of the Tobacco
Institute received press notice. A selection from the coverage is shown.
George V. Allen, president of the
Tobar.co Institute, Inc., is complain-
ing that the European Common Mar-
ket countries have "shown no sign
of a liberal trade policy for tobac-
CO."
That's another way of saying that
the duties imposed on American to-
bacco by the European "Big Six"
are too high+ . • . ; ', I
Matter of fact is that the United
States no longer is the only substan-
tial producer of quality tobacco in
the world. African countries pro-
duce the golden weed in a quality
which approaches our own, and pro-
duce it at a cost far under that con-
fronting the American tobacco grow-
er.
On top of that there is our own
control policy directed' at giving the
American grower enough for his
tobacco to enable him to maintain
a high standard of living.
This is done by deliberately reduc-
ing acreage and by putting a high
loan support flbor under the price of
tobacco as marketed in this coun-
try.
Domestically this is sensible and
": not ruinous either to the grower or
;' the smoker. By far the biggest item
.: in the cost of a package of American
' cigarettes is state and federal taxes,
not the cost of the raw material.
But companies which export to-
bacco buy it at support prices from
the tobacco growers, which means
that foreign tobacco buyers have to
f ~y the same prices that domestic
uyers have to pay. They not only
have to pay the American. support
price but they have to pay the tar-
iffs tbese countries place on Amer-
ican tobaccos, because the American
government places tariffs on the
things the y m'ake and export to
Americ$.
. One might suggest that a solution -
be found in applying the same for-
mula to tobacco that we apply to
cotton: sell it to the foreign market
at several cents a pound under what
we sell it to the domestic market,
with the government subsidizing the
difference.
Cotton manufacturers complain
that this system enables foreign tex-
tile mills to buy American cotton,
process it with cheap labor, and
then fire it back to American to com-
pete with the products of American
textile mills.
But one could hardly expect this
to happen in the matter of cigarettes.
After all the United States gpvern-
ment does not operate under the
theory that wearing a shirt is a sin
and therefore should be heavily tax-
ed. But it does, and has for years
adopte&amp;this attitude toward tobacco.
Even if we granted foreign pur-
chasers of tobacco subsidies similar
to the cotton subsidy, we could cx-
pect our own domestic iax on tobac-
co to discourage too much compe-
tition from foreign-made cigarettes
in this country.
When yott buy cigarettes in the
United States you are not just pur-
chasing a smoke, you are paying
taxes through the nose.

Smoking
LANSING (UPI) - A statewide
campaign to wipe out cigarette
smoking was launched here yes-
terday by major agencies in-
volved in health education.
Representatives of the Michi-
gan State Medical Society, three
voluntary health organizations
and two state agencies agreed to
coordinate activities in the cam-
paign. They met at the Michigan
Tuberculosis and' Respiratory
Disease Association (MTRDA) of-
fice.
The group will seek to inten-
sify educational programs on
the effects of smoking for fiftb
and'sixth graders and those at
the high school level, said J.
Irvin Nichols, MTRDA execu-
tive director.
Emphasis will' be put on the
younger people because it is eas-
ier to prevent cigarette smoking
from starting than it is to cure
it once the habit has taken hold,,
he said.
Dr. Henry J. VandenBerg Jr.,,
:)f Detroit, chairman of the can-
cer control committee of the
Michigan State Medical Society,
contended that the relationship
between cigarette smoking and
such diseases as asthma, emphy-
sema and' lung cancer was clear- .
ly established.
"We have been dishonest: with,
ourselves in calling smoking a
habit," VandenBerg said. "We
should call it an addiction. The
addictive nature comes from ab-
sorption into the system of the
nicotine contained in tobacco

'Stop Smoking' Believes
By DAVID BRAATEN
Star Btaff Writer
If your phone rings at 4
o'clock one of these. mornings
and a hoarse voice says, "Joe,
buddy, talk to me ... I need a j ing," said E. N. Folkenberg, one
smoke something awful," don't'of the co-directors of the free
be suI'prised• Icourse. "Within two and a
It will just be a backsliding half years, 50 to 55 per cent
tonight at the University of
Maryland.
One of the vital parts of the
program is "a buddy system
similar to that used by Alco-
holics Anonymous."
This means, as any television
viewer can tell you, that when
a tobaccoholic suddenly finds
himself alone with a Corona
Corona or a pack of filter-tips,
he can telephone a fellow nico-
tine addict for solace and en-
graduate of the Five Day Plan
to Stop Smoking, which opens
couragement.
The conversation may get a
little sticky, of, course, what
with the seven sticks of gum the
cigarette-kicker is chewing to
help him over the rough spots.
But if the will is there, success
is yours in a mere five days.
And If in a weak moment
the seductive aroma of a pana-
tela causes you to falI off the
tobacco wagon, you can al-
ways snuff out temptation by
re-reading the little pamphlet
that is handed out at the Five
Day Plan school.
"By the end of the third
night, 50 per cent of our stu-
dents have lost any real crav-
have quit for good."
On one point, Mr. Folken-
berg was emphatic.
"This is not a crusade
against tobacco,"' he said. "It's
only a program, if you want to
stop smoking, here's how to
do it."
The American tobacco in-
dustry hasnzt even gotten
burned up over the program,
he said, although it has beer-
cutting into their dividends
'for the past three years:
"The tobacco Industry has
,Igiven us no more trouble than
the liquor industry has given
Alcoholics Anor.ymous,"' he
said. The cigai ette companies'
attitude seems to be that they
don't want anyone smoking
their products who doesn't
want to or shouldn't; he said.
The program has been.spon-
sored nationally by the Seventh
Day Adventists, and the loeal
seminar is being sponsored b3
t n e , wasnmgton banztanum,
and Hospital. The Adventists
have been fighting a reargard
action for 100 years against
tobacco as a "slow-acting and
milignant poison~"
No Religious Overtones
The sponsors stress, however„
that there is no religious char-
acter to the program• No one
will be a s k e d to join the
church, and no collection plate
Fill be passed. The Adventists•
will not, however, discourage
those who come to cough and
remain to pray.
Anyone interested in enroll-
ing in the free course can call
Mr. Folkenbeig at JU 9-8800,
extension 604, to reserve a tick-
et for the five-evening series
opening at 7:45 tonight in the
Business and Public Adminis-

REMEMBER THE CRANBERRY SCARE?
By GE'ORGE L. SCOTT
(Deseret News Staff Writer)

~~ WAY cranberry sauce lingers
1 through the Christmas holidays
brings back memories of some in-
consistent events. •
• Some years back in the cranberry-
growing regions of western Wash-
ington a nation-shaking-spraying oc-
curred-
It was discovered
that choice.cranber-
ries that thrive west X
of the Cascades had
been sprayed right
and left with a dan-
gerous spray. In-
vestigators said the
spray could produce
cancer.
The word got out.
Wire news serv-
i c e s c a r r i e d t h e Geo. L Scott
,` warning to newspapers, radio and
TV stations - beware of those West-
ern Washington cranberries.
Food Inspectors polished their
glasses.. The hunt was on for those
cancer-cranberries.
HOUSEWIVES DEMAIITDED of
their grocerymen, "Did those cran-
. berries come from Washington? Are
these cranberries the ones sprayed
with cancer spray? What else have
, you got for holiday sauce?"
The cranberry market was defin-
itely off. It didn't matter if your
cranberries came from Skamokawa,
Washington, or Timbuktu, West Af-
rica, the nuying boom was lowered
with a dull thud.
There was not a single crar.berry-
car-Lcer. yictim reported.
And that was good.
People 'were alerted. People were
concerned. Warnings through news•
papers, radio and TV were taken
seriously.
What is inconsistent about that?
Not a thing!
The inconsistency comes from an-
other field.
Cancer-producing qjgarettes.
FOR THE PAST FIVE years, just
to skim the surface of cancer-cigar-
ette files, warning signals-that
make the cranberry - cancer scare
look pitiful-have been flashing from
medical centers. .
As far back as 1959, the American
Cancer Society delicately crossed
scientific swords with the Tobacco
Institute, whose powerful backing
would make a cranberry grower look
like a flyspeck on a bedsheet.
The American Cancer Society's
statement to Mr. James P. Richards
of the Tobacco Institute said:
"The American Cancer Society aC
cepts the weight of evidence indicat.
Ing that cigarette smoking is one of
the major causes of lung cancer in
human beings." Surgeon General Le-
roy Burney on July 12, 1957 stated,
"The Public Health Service feels the
weight of the evidence is increasing-
ly pointing in one direction, that ex
cessive smoking Is one of the causa-
tive factors in lung cancer."
HERE ARE A FEW OTHERS
that sounded warnings:
Seventh International Cancer Con
gress„ London, England.
American Medical Association
Journal carries a statement of the
Public Health Service on smoking
and lung cancer.
Dr. John R. Heller, director, Na-
tional Cancer Institute, in a release
to press, radio and television, in 1957
reeled off long articles in the _Lj.S.
News &amp; World Report giving facs
and figures on lung cancer and ci•
garettes. Just one item said: •
"A non-smoker, by the latest fig.
ures, has one chance in 275 of getting
lung cancer; a heavy cigarette smok-
er, one chance in 10."
But why go on - did the public
follow the cranberry road?
Has there been any ban on cigar
ettes as there was on cranberries?
Turn on your TV. Soft, crooning
music is heard as the beautiful maid-
er- lifts her cigarette briefly to her
lips. Her lips do not linger too long
around the filter tip. She does not
look too good that way.
Then the pep song. Big-time ath-
Ietes give a plug for the masculine
type cigarette. No caution about can-
cer danger.
Children are not forgotten. "Harm-
less" candy cigarettes are made for
them.
As far back as 1957, the late Sena•
tor Richard Neuberger and his wife,
Maurine, now Senator of Oregon,
said in the "Washington Column":
-"ADIERICANS LAST• YEAR
(1956) purchased 399 billion• cigar.
ettes at a cost of -$4 billion. Approxi.
mately 1% of this much was invest-
ed in research into the causes and
~ possible cures of cancer, including
carcinoma of the lung."
Please pass the cranberry sauce!

Lungs Can Age 20 Years f ar ; Heavy Smoker
By Science Serviee

'If you are a heavy cigare ' tte smok-

as 20 years more than normal.
Dr: R•oger Larson, a medical re-
searcher at the University of Cal-

lung function in more than 600
smokers and nonsmokers in Fresno,
Calif. Smoking babits and medical

X-rays were taken of each sub-

were made. The subject exhaled
into a device that plotted a graph of
his lung function, or breathing ca-
pacity.
S u b j e c t.s who had abnormal
X-rays, a history of lung or heart
disease, technically poor spirogramti
;r. incomplete medical histories, or
who smoked only ¢igars or pipes;
were eliminated' from the final analy-
sis.
This left 418, whose spirograms
were divided into groups according
to sex, age and smoking habits.
Marked differences in lung fune-
tion were noted between srnokers
and nonsmokers, particularly beyond
the age of 29. Dr. Larson found the
spirograms of smokers equivalent
to those of nonsmokers 20 years
older.

{ The chances of a break-

Increasing with the accumu- :, &lt; ~ j ~`a? »R
&lt;: lation of data on. the causes of
human cancer, the American
Medical Association said today.
The AMA's appraisal, re- , t~I x
'leased today, said the question,
..°How long until medical, sci- lp s~%
ence cures cancer?" seems to
have taken on new urgency
with, the deaths recently of four
we11-known actors within 18 i~
days of each other. i~
"Mild panic" was touched off
among Southern California
men, who pushed into cancer
-detection centers in record • ,
numbers, the AMA reported.
A cure, said the AMA, seems
"well-nigh inevitable" and has r`
alreadY begun, In that irradia- ~ ~
iion, certain drugs and surgery, ts s~Nj
have prevented death from can-.
Cer among thousands and en-
abled them to live until death„ t
' caught them up from other • .{
, -causes, including old age. , ~
The key to many of these
cures has, been early detection.
.` ,:The question, "How long be-
fore there's a cure?" is largely
unanswerable, the AMA said.
But' "the chaos that per- h
oaded the field (of cancer re-
search) a few decades ago ~ has
'been largely cleared away . . .
"There is finally a high de-

When these molecules are
disrupted by foreign chemicals,
invaded by a vitus or changed
by radiatlon; then the normel O
dictates from the nucleus are
altered, apparently touching off O
cancerous growth, the AMA ~
statement' said.
"All of this," the AMA said, . ~
"is* a long way 'from the type

ROSESONIAN
Lumberton, N.C.
'February 18, 1963
ON-EXCLUSIVE CAUSE

': Anyone who smokes will get lung cancer "unless
he dies of something else beforehand."
That.was 'a somewhat less than devastating state- .
ment by the arch-enemy of smoking, Dr. Alton Ochsner
~of New Orleans, at a sectional meeting of the Ameri-
can College of Surgeons last week in Charlotte.
. It might be added: Anyone. who does not smoke
wilt get 'lung c.ancer-unless he dies of something else.
beforehand.. Live long enough, avoiding death~ from
any and all other 'causes, and lung cancer is pretty
sure to develop, if it's the only thing that can finish
a person off.
The. famous surgeon called smoking "a form of'
suicide," which is a variation of the old practice of
calling cigarettes "coffin nails." More objectively, he .
' contended that' "smoking causes precancer changes in
. the (body) cells; but these changes are reversible if
. the smoker abstains completely."
.. A government-sponsored study has been underta-
ken, in an effort to determine how much truth there
may be to back up the dramatized charges about ci-
ga'rettes and the relationship of smoking to health.
Chances are the findings will be neither all white nor
all black but in the gray area between.
Meanwhile, it seems desirable.for tobacco growers
to produce some quality leaf - at least enough to keep
in practice -.and to try other crops. If the government
report on smoking sliould be unfavorable arid demand
for'tobacco should decrease, the better grades pre-
sumably would be the easiest to sell. Other crops
could help to make up. for a reduction In tobacco in-
come. If the government report happens to be favor=
able, the demand for tobacco still would include qua-
lity lsaf. and income from other crops still would ber
usable.

Hazards of Judging
Next to the . heavy smokers them-
selves, doctors are the most concerned
about whether cigarettes are a hazard
to health. Yet while the controversy has
boiled for years, it was not until its last
annual meeting that the American Medi-
cal Association got into the fray. At that
time, the AMA voted to appoint a spe-
cial committee of "impartial"' experts to
Ceview•w the evidence linking cigarettes
to lung cancer and other diseases. Last
week, the AMA dropped the project.
The reason: no impartial scientists could
be found.
About 150 possible panel members
:r.were considered during the past nine
months, said an AMA spokesman, "but
every one was solidly pro or con," T he.
AMA also noted that a study of the.
~ cigarette-health question is already
under way by a ten-man committee ap-
\ pointed by Surgeon General Luther L.
M Terry. (This panel, composed of scien-
tists tists who have never taken a public

Cigare# Danger
Label Adv~nies
By DON WALTON
Star Staff Writer
Unicameral Monday by a 5-2
vote of the Public H e a l t h
Committee.
The director of the Eppley
Institute for Research in Can-
cer and' Allied Diseases
teamed with University of Ne-
braska football star B f 11
"Thunder" Thornton in lead-
ing testimony in support of
the measure.
Legislation to I a b e I al1
packages of cigarets with the
warning that they "will en-
danger human health" was
advanced to the floor of the
Dr. Henry Lemon of Omaha
told the committee.
The bill, LB368, Dr. Lemon
-said, will be "a step forward
in the ultimate control of can-
cer of the lung."
'Cut Death Rater
A reduction in excessive
cigaret smnxinrt would also
"significantiy reduce" t h e
deatkrate of coronary artery
diseases, he declared.
"This is not a matter of
morals," Dr. Lemon pointed
out. "It is a matter of the
science of health. If we label
dangerous drugs, then •we
should so label cigarets."
Thornton t o 1 d the comrnit-
tee that scientific research
"has proved that c I g a r e t
smoking, leads to considerable
damage to the tissues a n d
lining of the lungs."
If such danger exists, he
declared, then "every person
in Nebraska should be aware
of it. This is not meant ,io
scare smokers . ~ . buY' it
would aid greatly In letting a
boy or girl decide whether to
smoke."
The measure - introduced
by Sen. T. C. Reeves of Cen-
tral City - also attracted
the support of the. Merrick
County Medical Society.
Dr. John Campbell, presi-
dent of the society, said re-
research proves "a definite
causal relationship between
smoking and lung cancer."
Such evidence, he said, is
"based on solid scientific and
medical grounds."
Reeves cited a number of
medical studies which drew
the conclusion that cigarets
contribute to lung cancer, res-
piratory, diseases and heart
conditions. . .
In 1930, be said, 2,400

'No Moral Conscience'
"The tobacco companies
have no moral conscience,"
Reeves declared. "They nev-
er concern themselves with
the suffering and misery
which is the aftermath of the
cigaret habit."
Representatives of 4 Ne-
braska cigaret wholesale
firms opposed the bill, stat-
ing that scientific researc

caut;er i2i Uoux u.uout;luslve
and contradictory.
Labeling of their praduct,
they said, would be unfair
and discriminatory.
"No one has ever proved
that cigaret smoking causes
cancer," Edward Zorkowski
of Omaha told the commit-
tee.
"Labeling would mislead the
public about a scientific ques-
tion not yet settled."

20 different kinds of tempta-

smoking seminar was being

a leading tobacco-producing
State.
The parking lot was about
a quarter mile from the audi-

chorus of wheezing and puffing
was a heart-rending sound. In
the lobby, clear-eyed, pleasant
men with sparkling white teeth
handed out reserved tickets
Audience of 400
In the auditorium, about 400
persons gathered, shifty-eyed
and brooding, with yellow teeth
and a variety of nervous man-
nerisms. There was a good deal
of_1tp and fingernail nibbling
and`a steady tattoo of drum-
ming on the chair arms.
I chose a seat in front of a
stunning blond in a red sweater
and horn-rimmed glasses. She
was chattering compulsively to
her neighbors, a middle-aged
couple, discussing beef houses,
supermarkets and virus. Piped
music played soothingly in the
background, punctuated with
the ever-present staccato of
the smoker's hacking cough.
A gentleman named Mr.
Marple called the class t'o order,
noting that "apparently the
weatherman doesn't want to
kick the habit." This brought
a ripple of laughter and a wave
of coughs and' throat clearings.
V1'a,:king on Air .
Neal C. Wilson, board chair-
man of Washington Sanitarium

us and predicted that "many

Then the two course leaders.
Elman J. Folkenberg and Dr.
J. Wayne McFarland, both
Seventh-day Adventists, intro-
duced a full-color film about
lung cancer, which they said
Here are some of the first

warm water.
Nothing but fruit and

who smoke. Have three
more glasses of water be-

then added "For those of you
who may be squeamish, we'll
let you know when to duck
your head."
The film, in full color, as
about a young newspaper editor
who had to have a lung re-
moved because of cancer.
The scene is laid in New
Orlr.ans; where the surgeon
cheerfully tells the hero, Bill
Johnson, that he has a 50-50
chance of survival. Stunned.
Bill breaks a lifelong habit and
goes to church. Then, after
phoning "my little wife, Mary,"
he flips away his last coffin
nail and' enters the hospital,
observing that, "Where there's
smoke, there's fire."
Just as the surgeon raised
his scalpel for the first bloody
incision, Mr. Folkentierg called
out, "Duck your heads!" Sev-
eral women-and a few men-
did so.

The rest either sat transfixed
or squirmed uncomfortably as
Bill's left lung, black with to-
bacco tars, was snipped out,
;. Remember Emile Coue?
"This could make me give
up movies," muttered one young
man, with a nervous chuckle.
After the film, Mr. Folken-
berg and Dr. McFarland ex-
plained the plan and the first"
; day's • rules. Willpower is the
big thing, they said,
"Say 'to yourself, I CHOOSE
not to smoke, I CHOOSE not
to smoke," said Mr. Folkenberg.
. "Now everybody, say it out
loud." The class did. "Again."
We repeated it.
If the incantation reminded
any of the older students of
Emile Coue and "Every day in
every way, I am growing bet-
ter and better," nobody men-
tioncd it.
"This isn't going to be any
picnic," warned Dr. McFarland.
"It's not a meriy-go-round
ride, but you can make it. You
may think you're going to die,
but you won't."
Then he gave a demonstra-
tion of how to breathe deeply
("Put your hands under your
ribs here, breathe way in, then
sniff and pull out on your
ribs.") and everyone. tried it •
twice.
Finally, we were told to
choose a "buddy" to exchange
phone numbers with, so we
could call each other and offer
mutual encouragemenL The
'blond in the red sweater al-
ready had a buddy, so I set-
tled for a pack-and-a-half-
a-day man named Joe.
Little books with the first
day's detailed regimen were
distributed, and the class dis-
persed, with Dr. McFarland's
final tip ringing in our ears:
"If it gets really bad, hop in
the shower."
Out in the cold night air,
everyone practiced deep breath-
ing as we slipped and slid over
the ice to our cars. The audi-
torium is near the psychology
lab where chimpanzees are
learning arithmetic. I won-
dered if the monkeys were
being taught to smoke.
This morning I called Joe
to ask, "How's it going?" "So
far, so good," he said, "but I
sure don't like warm water."

Hazards of Judging
Next to the . heavy smokers them-
selves, doctors are the most concerned
about whether cigarettes are a hazard
to health. Yet while the controversy has
boiled for years, it was not until its last
annual meeting that the American Medi-
cal Association got into the fray. At that
time, the AMA voted to appoint a spe-
cial committee of "impartial"' experts to
Ceview•w the evidence linking cigarettes
to lung cancer and other diseases. Last
week, the AMA dropped the project.
The reason: no impartial scientists could
be found.
About 150 possible panel members
:r.were considered during the past nine
months, said an AMA spokesman, "but
every one was solidly pro or con," T he.
AMA also noted that a study of the.
~ cigarette-health question is already
under way by a ten-man committee ap-
\ pointed by Surgeon General Luther L.
M Terry. (This panel, composed of scien-
tists tists who have never taken a public

To finance the model "Neuberger Smoking Control Act" provisions, the federal cigarette
tax should be boosted. The tax structure should be changed so that the tax would be
levied according to the weight of the tobacco in a cigarette rather than the length.
Tax reform should be coupled with a program of mandatory maximum controls on "permissible
tar, nicotine, and phenol yields of cigarettes," which woulld'be set by the Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare after appropriate study.
A further provision: a tobacco'company whichIcomplies with a national smoking-control
~ program should be subject only to limited liability for smoking-connected diseases
and that an express'limit of liability should be made part of any omnibus smoking-
control program.

. KICKING NI CO T I NE
re Water, Fewer Friends
•
By DAVID BRAATEN
; Star seaff wiuee
Mark Twain Is usually cred-
ited with originating the old
saw about kicking the nicotine
habit. "Why, it's perfectly easy
i to quit smoking," he sai'&amp; "I
' know. I've done It myself hun-
'.dreds of times."
But Twain never quit under
the rules of the 5-Day Plan
now being offered by the
Seventh-Day Adventists at the
University of Maryland. Cutting
out smoking Is only partt of the
plan. We students are also ex-
pect'ed to give up booze, coffee
and human companionship.
, Avoid friends who smoke, the
instruction manual says flatly.
I don't know about your office;
friend, but down at The Star
this leaves me with the obitu-
ary editor, a copyboy and an
octegenarian rewrite man to pal
around with. Of course, it could
be worse. If the stricture had
been to avoid friends who drink,
I'd have had to quit the news-
paper business.
It's harder than you might I
'think to avoid friends who
smoke. Once the word gets out
that there's a heretic loose, the
butt fiends flock around, de-
termined to lure you down the
fiery path to carcinoma. Yellow
teeth leering evilly, they tempt
you with nicotine bon-bons or
aneer "chicken!" or try other
nefarious means to drag you
RULES FOR PLAN
Here are today's rules for the
5=Day Plan:
Warm shower, followed by
Cold Mitten Friction. Hearty
breakfast, with plenty of fruit,
no coffee. Five-minute walk.
If tension mounts at work,
breathe deeply, get a drink of
water remind yourself: "I
choose not to Smoke."
Avoid spiced meats, fried
foods for lunch. More fruit.
Call your buddy for mutual
encouragement in mid-after-
noon.
Don't overeat at dinner. Get
some fresh air before sitting
down to watch television, or
read the paper. Warm shower
and early to bed.
i
back into the ranks of the
doomed.
The only recourse, of course,
is a slashing counterattack.
"Ecchh!1' you exclaim. "How
can you put those filthy poison-
ous things in your mouth?" Or,
sympathetically. "Say, that
cough isn't getting any better,
Is it, old man? But then, we've
all got to go sometime, I guess:'
i One of the hardest parts of
the 5-Day Plan Is the heavy
;tress on drinking water. As one
French view, that water Is for
washing wine glasses, I find it
Impossible to toss down eight
or 10 glasses of converted Po-
tomac In the course of a day.
iAnd after a certain amount of
fruit juice. I find the tongue
and gum beginning to pucker
a bit.
But' apparently not everyone
was bothered by this. As a full
500 students took their seats
for the second night's session,
the Sunday night background
noise of coughing had been re-
placed by another sound:
sloshing. Some people were so
water-logged they bubbled
when they talked, like a water-
cooler.
There was another color
movie on lung cancer. Unlike
the opening night's horror film,
this one was merely depress-
ing. It started in a graveyard
and got' progressively gloomier.
Coffee came in for a lump
or two in the lecture that fol-
lowed the film, as Dr. J. Wayne
McFarland explained why the
heavenly brew Is on the pro-
scribed list for the duration of
the five-day course. Caffeine,
like alcohol, acts on the very
same brain~ cells that nicotine
has been ~ weakening.
"Caffeine Is a booby trap,"
he said, "first It stimulates the
nervous system, then it para-
lyzzes it. The 'lift'' you get from
who has long favored the coffee Is just' borrowed energy
that you'll have to replace in
the future. Caffeine forces your
nervous system to lie to you."
And, for those who feel they
f ust can't wake up in the morn-
ing without a cup of coffee, Dr.
McFarland offered a substitute
called, believe it or not, C o 1 d
Mitten Friction. This means
rubbing yourself - after your
morning warm shower - with
a friction glove or old towel
wrung out in cool water, until
the skin is pink.
"Start with just one arm,"
aaid the doctor merrily. "Each
day rub more and more with
colder and colder, water, until
in a week or so, you've got ,1ust
a trayful of ice and you rub
your whole body - and you
just love it!"
Occasional Prune
This method, of course, ?M,
another advantage over coffee
- your screams will rouse peo-
ple for blocks around, w h o
otherwise might have overslept~.
For those who find that cut-
ting out smoking leaves thcir
mouths with nothing to do be-
tween tween meals, Dr. McFarland'
suggested an occassional•
prune.
"First you cat the meat, and
then you've got the pit to play
around with," he explained.
The plan's co-director, Elman
J. Folkenberg, had a word of
cheer for the smoke-kickers.
"The first three days are the
toughest," he said, "so hang on.
Just remember, things could be
worse, and they probably will be.
But think to yourself, e v e r y
cigarette cuts 11.4 minutes off
your life."
We're on the verge of better
living, he told us: "In I few
days, your wife's cooking will'
have improved immeasurably.
you'll have insomnia licked, and
even more important you w i l l
have the knowledge that you are
doing right.
Probably the most heartening
news of the evening was the an-
nouncement that shuttle c a r s
would henceforth be available to
haul Plan members between the
auditorium and the parking lot.
The tar-blackened lungs of the,
ex-smokers proved barely up to
the task Sunday night.

The Tobacco Indiistry Research Committee was created to slay "the smoking and health
dragon." The industry was able to attract scientists of "unimpeachable ir.tegrity"'
to serve on a Scientific Advisory Board. The Tobacco Institute's chief function is
public relations, and(so she write4 it was able to "nip in the bud" a 1958'Canadian

used in the study, Dr. Seltzer said.
Smoking habits were determined in
1959 by means of a questionnaire,
he said. The 922 men responding in-
cluded 688 smokers and 234 nonsmo-
kers, he said.
The primary significance of the
findings is the implcaton that gen-

Research Fellow in Physical Anth-
ropology. Smokers also had larger
head, face, shoulder, chest, hip, leg
and hand dimensions than nonsmo-
kers, he said.
"What is most striking, liowever,
is the existence of a consistent grad-
ed patt'ern of differentiation of the
smoker types into a specific order of
arrangement," Dr. Seltzer said.
Differences in physical character-
istics between cigar smokers and
nonsmokers were greater than be-
'tween pipe smnkers and nonsmokers
were greater than between cigarette
smokers and nonsmokers, he said.
F'or example, he said, the mean
wPight of the cigarette smokers was
four pounds hevier than the non-
smokers, this ::zeans weight of the
pipe smokers was six pounds heav-

and chest dimensions, are for the

said.
It is becoming increasingly clear,
he said, that the smoking habit, the
form of smoking adopted, and ab-
sentention from smoking are nnt
simply superficial behavior patterns
resulting from environmental in-
fluences. On the contrary, he said,
"smoking behavior appears to be a
response to a wide variety of per
sonality and behavioral character-
istics which have their origin, in
part,, in the biological or genetic
m,ake&lt;up of the individual.
Dr. Seltzer speculated that a con
stitutional factor might be similarly
involved in patients with lung can-
cer because of the association be-
tween smoking and lung cancer.
There is no evidence that this is so,
he said, but urged research in this
area as a possible mean of identify-

„

~V Our feeling of vague unease
.
is not helped by the ironic word-
; fng of the high school Parent-
'-Teacher Association resolution
;`sapporting the new policy: "Due.
;lto the concern we, as parents,
::feel for the health of our young
people. • "
° To complete the feeling of
: 'juzziness, we understand. that
;some students themselves don't
like the new arrangement be-
i'cause It separates them aceord-
,.ing to building division for the
: oourtyard smoking break, when
they'd like to get out onto the
bus ramp and meet their friends
from other divisions!
The feature which could be the
best or the worst feature of the
new rule 9s _ the need to get a
parental letter in order to smoke.
It could be the best, we think, if
all the parents insist on being
old-fashioned and refuse permis-
sion; and worst if they shrug and
; sign up because It's the easier
thing to do,"

: , WE'VE-M4RD. it_explained,
as we recall, that no-smoking
would be difficult to enforee and
would make "policemen" of
faculty members; that students l
will attempt to 'smoke anyway;
that the administration should
try to be cooperative instead of
Ifighting the students and creat-
ing a hostile atmosphere not
conducive to learning; that there
is disruption to classes in ses-
sion created by the exodus to
the bus ramp; and that the
danger to health of smoking is
taught in. class. ' .;
As we say, it's difficult to
argue the point, since we don't
have to cope with the situation
day by day as the school peo-
ple do, and must rely merely on
our. own knowledge and back-
ground.
Nobody can put his finger on
just when it happened, but i't
does seem that someplace along
the line in our handling of teen-
age problems like smoking we
overstepped the bounds of. what
we used to call common sense.
This is true of parents no less
than school people, here and
elsewhere, and we've all got
some' answering to do to our-
selves. '


SMOKING IS a habit. It
serves no positive purpose_ex
cept providinQ a superficial sort
mounting that it may be harm-
ful to health. It can produce lit-
ter, and can also be annoying to
others when carried out in
cramped. quarters. It can be a
fire hazard. ?
When we went to high school'
-yes, we'll say it again - we
seem to.recall that these: were
enough reasons. Smoking was
OUT. And if'a pupil was caught
smoking he was OUT, too.
Everybody understood it, and
the. faculty was respected. No
compromi'se was made, nor was
i't necessary.
We seem to be afraid to speak
up to our own children nowa-
days. If they won't behave, or
won't learn, we change the
rules so that misbehaving be-
comes 'acceptable -conduct;, or
we make it easier for them to
not-learn.
As, we said, it happened some-
place along the line, and we
sometimes feel sheepish about
making a big to•do about any
new example of permissiveness
toward our children which by it-
self may be difficult to argue
against.
Maybe the time is coming
when somebody will have to be:
a rBal hairshirt and stand up
for what is common sense in-
stead of what L expedient and
the line of least resistance.

Star statf writer . r.;
After smoking, what?
Alumni of the Five-Day Plan
to Stop Smoking met au" Whea-
ton High School last night to
learn what, if anything, we can
do with the years we have
added to our lives by kicking
the nicotine habit.
We had slain the amoke-
belching dragon, and the ardor
of the crusade was ebbing. Like
Suffragettes smugly contem-
plating the Nineteenth Amend-
ment, we surveyed our nobly
won freedom from tobacco and
asked ourselves:
"Now that we've got it, what
do we do with it?"
A tricky question, but fortu-
nately for all of us, the leaders
of the Five-Day Plan had a
ready answer:
Nuts.
Nuts-veAlntits. pecans, {&gt;ea-
,
nuts, cashews,' any old 7qnd~
'can help us enjoy the `braye
'new werld we: havp -conquered
by forswe~rtng:'sigaxetteFS, ci -
gars and 1~i$es.' we' learned
•- Nibbling 'nuts, `snd'; pfckin
the little fragments out of our
teeth„can help our mouthsfor-
tudy Future

get that old craving for'the
soothing comfort of the filter-
tig pacifier. . • '
Cracking nuts will keep our
hands as busy as they.used to
be lighting matches, flicking
ashes and lacquering over the
charred spots on the coffee
table.
And learning to cc.k with
nuts and other health foods, it
became clear, can easily use up
the eight or ten years of life
we have gained.
To teach us how, the Fl ie-
Day planners handed out rec-
ipes for lentil loaf, cottage
cheese loaf, garbanzo stew with
dumplings, Queen Ann timbales
cashew nutmeat loaf, S w i s s
vegetable steaks, vegeburger
loaf, and honey raisih bars.
"Oh brother!" exclaimed one
housewife, as she examined the
recipe for the cashew nut loaf.
'"Good,I,,ord!" exclaimed. her
husband, ris- he eatat'ed. *l.assy-
eyed "^'at tiq SreCipe ~ iois lentil
logoThBn, in a _• re~cless, gesture,.
the planners handed- around
samples of the various vege-n tarian foods, prepared by diet!-;
tians from the kitchens of the
3eventh-Day Adventists' Wash-
ngton Sanitarium and Hos-
ital. There were bits of non-
eat loaf and little cubes of
'white meat chicken;,' made of
soybeans.
I We digested them in silence,
for the most part, although
some of the reformed smokers
-those with the liveliest imag-
inations-smacked their lips
Iand murmured, "Not bad!" or,
tnore judiciously, "Not half
bad!"
"One thing's sure," said the
ubious housewife, as she rolled
piece of soybean chicken
round' on her tongue, "I may
hot live longer by giving up
smoking, but' if I eat this stuff
every day, It'll sure seem
longer!"'
As the meeting brokc up and
we headed for home, picking
bits of vegeburger out of our
teeth, I overheard evidence
that still another Five-Day
Plan may be necded.
."Now that • .'.'ve glVen up
smok;ng, there's Just one thing
I want to kr.ow," said a younr
lady to nobody In particular.

Primary significance of the '
study, according to Dr. Seltzer, is

color of hair and eyes, stature,

~ speclYl to Tlw New Taefc 2Uaes..
' CHICAGO, Feb. 22-The big-
ger they are the harder 'they
smoke, a Harvard anthropolug-
tst said today. ,
This polnt was made in the
Journal of the American,Med=
ical Association by Dr. Carl : C:
. Seltzer, a Harvard researeh fei"
low in physical anthropology,
who has a doctorate In that
field.
He said that' there were stat-
isticalily significant differences
In the body build between smok-
ers and nonsmokers and •that
there were physical variations
among the smokers of cigar-
ettes, cigars and pipes. Cigar
smokers, for exampie, were con-
siderably heavier.
• "Smokers are oonaistently
greater than nonsmokere- in
height and weight and in the
dimensions of the head, face,
shoulders, chest, hip, leg and
hand," he said.
Suggesting a genetic (inher-
ited) factor in the reasans why
people be,came a.ddicted to the
tobacco habit, he urged - more
study on a possible relation be-
tween physique, heredity and
lung cancer. '
Dr. Seltzer's data was based
on 922 membess of the F3srvard
College class of 1946.
Twelve measurements had
been made of them as freshmen
In 1942 as part of a regular
medical exa.nination.- These
measurements included height;
ot
weight and the dimmsion9t
the hEad; face, shoulders, chest,
hip, leg and hand.
. . "In every instance the smok-
ers showed larger mean dtmen- :
sions than the nonsmokers," Dr. ;I
Seltzer said in his report.
From this sample he general- °
ized about smokers and non-
smokers, saying: _,;•tir0
"It is clearly evident from ;
the data presented.., that smok- `
ers as a group differ in their '
morphological (organic atruc-
ture) characteristics as young
adults from nor.smoicers. The
differences between them - are
consistent, substantial, and per-'
tain to both dimensions and ,
proportions. +: ' : r^
"What is most striking, how '
ever, is the existence of a cpa-
sistent graded pattern of dif-
ferentiation of the smoker
;
types Into a specific order or
arrangement." He said that the cigarette ;
smokers d:ffered least from '
nonsmokers, followed in degree .
of differentiation by . the pipe
smokers and theT the cigar .
smokers. • • -
Thus, the cigare~`ei smok'e2~s ` `
of 1959 were 4.37 pounds heavier ..
than nonsmokers when they
were In coflege;,, the pipe smok- '
ers outweighed the nonsmokers "
by 6.59 pounds at Harvard and '`
the men who were listed as
otger smokers in 1959 were "
10.41 pounds heavier than their
nonamokine clasSmatPR in 1942. _.
Results at Age of 35
Then, Ln 1959,,when they were
13 years out of college and' aver-
aged 35 years of age, these Har-
vard men, in replies to a ques-
tionnaire, provided Dr. Seltzer
with information on the.ir smok-
ing habits.. The 922 men re-
sponding included 688 smokers
and 234 nonymckers.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Tobac-
co growing is fast becoming the
"last stronghold of the family
farm" in the United States, saysi
l
an Agriculture Department offi-
cial.
While nearly three million in-
dividual family farms have dis-
appeared from the scene in the
past 43 years, the number of to-
bacco farms actually has in-
creased, said StepliemE. Wrather,
director of the Tobacco Division
of the department's Agricultural
Marketing Service.
"The historical place of tobacco
in American agriculture is expect-
ed. to remain stable," he writes
In the 'trade publication Tobacco
News.
have declmed from 4.9 mrllron to
1.9 million and wheat farms from
2.2 million to 931,000.
Resisted Trend
Tobacco farming has resisted
the trend toward elimination of
small farms despite production
costs that run about five times
that of cotton and more than 11
times corn production costs, he
wrote.
The reason: said Wrather, is
that' tobacco "is a hand-tailored
operation" requiring more person-
al attention than any other crops
and gives a higher cash return
to the farmer.
The only other cash crop that
has shown an increase while the
number of f a r m s generally
dropped about 45 per cent in the
past four decades is soybeans,
Wrather saidi
5th Cash Crop
Wrather cited North Carolina,
the top tobacco-growing state, as
an example. "From 1949 to 19f1
the number of tobacco farms rose
from 129.850 to 131,070; a gaiu of
1,220," he said. In the same state,
the overall farm total dropped'
from 301,000 to 205,000, •he said.
While tobacco farms are gener-
ally small, averaging a little less
than three acres, the leaf is the
nation's fifth lbrtticsl cash crop
and third largest export crop,
Wrather noled:
And althnuuli few farmers relv

solely on tobacco, it' is' the''cas
mainstay for many.
.
famdtesw
"The number of farm
who depend on tobacco runs:a
good deal higher than the actual"
count of tobacco farms ' Wrathcr~;
said.

Agriculture Department figure~~,~,

get a"significanE part" of' their'&gt;
income from tobacco at 7U0.OOn: `
Wrather wrote
.
Tobacco is grown in 21 states'
from as far north as Connecticut
to as far south as Florida, Wrath=r,j
er noted; The leaders, in order, r
are North Carolina. Kentucky,.ry,
'
Virginia• South Carolina, Georgitt,
and Tennessee. ray`
"In many of these states, to-:'
Tobacco farms have increased bacco is among the top txo or'
from 496,009 to SI7;1100 since 1919; three casli crops," Wrather said '
•
Wrather said, while corn farms i, Although indications are that ;
"fewer and fewer families will
earn a living from the land." to-
bacco is expected to hold its own
in this respect for many years in .

the future, he added.
No Adaption q
T o b a c c o' s inadaptability to
mechanization, the major cause of
elimination of small family farms,
is one reason, Wrather said.
He said a study by North Car
olina's Department of Agriculture ~
ishowed flue-cured tobacco' re-•,
Iquires about 4% hours per acre
on a small family farm, com-
pared with about 29 hours for
corn and onty five hours for
wheat.
But, he added. "while personal
attention is still the byword' for
the tobacco fa,rmer, improved
methods and, equipment havee
enabled hinm to get bigger crop
yields and a higher cash return
per acre."
Another reason for the stability
of tobacco farming shows up in.
the government's handling of
farm surpluses. Wrather saiit. Sur-
pluses mean "substantial outlays
for some crops," he said, but "not
so with tobacco. Supplyy and de-
mand have remained fairly even
over the years."

tionnaire compiled and mailed
with the co-operation of the

` no tie-in between cigarettes and
lung cancer. °`Maybe" was se.

per cent of the physicians

plied they didn't know.
Professional pollsters, whcn
Informed that the 302 replies
eepresented better than 36 per
cent of the OOLA member•
ship which composed the mai:-
ing lisk said the response
would rate irom "excellent to
superior" by their standards.
This would be interpreted as
representing an intense interest
in the topic by the doctors, the
poll takers stated.
There were three reasons for
asking Orange County doctors
to give their oplniqns on cig-
arette smoking: . •
1. Many persons thinking of
starting or giving up cigarette
• smoking don't have clinical
statistical evidence upon which
to base their decision.
2. The doctors have been re-
ceiving this information during
practically all of, the years
since World War 11 when lung
cancer and cigarette smoking
started receiving wide-spread
publicity.

.y. ' . ' . ...' . .
3. Veteran reporters wnw
have covered. medical _ society
meetings have noted that un-
like most crowds you can spot
the individual puffs of smoke
generated by tobacco - enthu-
siasts in the audience.
As proof that most of thee
eounty's doctors are alarmed
by the incidence of disease as
smoking increases among pa-
tients, the survey showed that
while 201 of the physicians
amoked at one time = 133 of
wese smokers have given cig-
arettes up.
But' the survey also showed
that "giving up" isn't any
easiei• for doctorg than anyone
else. Thirty-three of the doc.-
tors who swore off admitted
that they had started again.
Other figures turned up
revealed that 99 of the doc-
tors never started smoking.
Since they were not asked to
give their age it could not be
determined if these were
younger men who were going
through medical school at' the
time the publicity' started -
a fact which might have scared
many of then: away from tak-
ing the first puff.
While they were not asked
to sign the survey many of the
doctors who took the time to
make iridividualn comments on
the situation did so, further
evidencing their strong feel-
ings on the subJect.
Among those doctors linking
cigarettes with lung cancer one
reply' bore the cryptic note,
"'I recently have had a portion
f of one lung removed which had
a cancerous growth on it. I
had '`been a heavy smoker
throughout my adult life. I
have stopped smoking."
Other personal comments in-
cluded these statements:
"Less critical clinical. evi-
dence has forced' the removal
from the market of drugs,
which while dangerous, have
also had beneficial effects upon
some illnesses: I should think
this should enter the argument'
somewhere." .
"I can think of no reason
for, recommending to' my pa-
tients that . they start smoking.
No evidence, even that put out
by tobacco manufacturers, has
pointed to any sound, good
benefits from smoking.
Several of the doctors said
they felt cigarette smoking
should be labelled' "addicting"
rather than "habit forming"
due to the inability of many
smoker's - if not all - to
squash out that famous "last"
cigarette and stop once and
for all.
"I recently won a good-sized
bet from a doctor friend of
mine who said he could stop
smoking whenever he wanted,"
one doctor recalled. "With all
the evidence at hand, with alll
the patients he's seen suffer-
ing the effects of smoking -
he couldn't stop.
"I'm sorry I won the bet. I
don't like to think of what
may happen someday If he
continues smoking."
.
While many of the doctors
hinted that they wou1d like to
see some sort of realistic coll-
trols placed on - youngsters'
smoking, none advocated aetual
legislat;un along these li.-ies.
The general tenor of their rre-
plies,, however;, was; that there
should be as much publicity
given the bad side of smoking
as is given what they termed
its "benefits."
"With cigarette advertising
emphasizing more and more
the 'sophistication' of modern
America's s m o k i n g habits,"'
one doctor wrote, "there should
be enlarged educational' pro-
• grams aimed at high school
audiences to show that there
are detrimental side-effects al-
ao."
Another doctor's reply Aas ' .
a literary shrug of the should-
ers as he stated, ;'What good
does it do to tell youngsters
they may be killing themselves
when their . high a c h o o 1
football stars puff away, their
parents smoke and a deluge
of literature _t,eils them it is.
the 'smar thing to do?"
A heavy percentage of the
comments revolved around this
point and indicated that in ,or-
der to get to the basic point of
eliminating smoking the word
must be gotten to beginning
smokers or youths just think-
ing about starting.
"You can just about give up
trying to change the smoking
patterns of older persons," one
doctor declared. "But educa-
tion among the young can still
fiave some meaning,"

times when increasing the sales tax on a nonessential, the cigaret, is
preferable, to increasing the use fee on an essential, the automobile, or
curtailing certain essential state services." He said $1,000,000 of this

"The objective of inedicinee

they looked into- the possibility
that older and ill persons , are
likely to- move from country to
city and medical diagnosis is like-
ly-to be.quicker and more accu-
rate in the city. ,
Urbanites Smoke More
If these were thc factors ac-
eounting for the high "excess,"
you'd expect the same "excess"
betec too, but It was slight com-
pared to the one for lung cancer.
Next the statisticians eliminat•
ed the established differences ir
the smoking habits of city anc
county residents. City people de
smoke more than country people
and the amounts by which the5
dio have been statistically estab-
lisbed. It fell far short of account-
fag for the "e=_cess" in urban
lung cancer deaths.
Then they eliminated the possi-
bility that city industrial workers
accounted for it. Some industries
use or Drodnee caeeer causing
aubstances. In the past their
workers have been involved in
lung cancer statistics. But if this
were a factor it would be a very
siight one, the statisticians con-
cluded.
. They calculated that all these
factors•could account fbr 18 to 30
per cent of the "excess" of ur-
ban lung cancer deaths over rural
ones. But the "excess" amounted
to 58 to 130 per cent. Clearly, in
their opinion, other things were
t,nvolved. -
Air Yollatloa Likely
"Air pollution is proposed as a
more likely explanatfon," said
Drs. Hugh R. Gilmore Jr. and
Pavid M. Ander#on in reporOog
to the Pennsylvania Medical 8o-
ciety. "Air pollutants include car-
cinogenic (cancer-causing) sub-
atances which might cause lung
cancer."
Previous statistical studies have
shown that lower sodiAl and eco-
nomic status is somehow associ~
ated with higher rates for lung
i*cer. "If ~group s~_~of low socio-
leoboratl'sfatus"b'e pre•suawd: ie

areas this may be at factor,"' Gil-
a?ore and Anderson said.
"Air poilutiop may be relatcd
to the socioeoonomic factor since
likely to be of~low socio-
economic statua.°
At any rate, they came to a
conclusion which previous scien-
tific students of the subject have
reached. They put it this way:
"More information Is needed on
the degree of air pollution in re-
lation to the incidence of lung
cancer."

decade ago, it might well have been
overlookedi Its significance today is
largely attributable to the surge of re-
search interest' in viruses as a cause of
cancer, which started with Dr. Wendell
M. Stanley's pronouncement in 1956
that "the time has come when we should
assume that viruses are responsible for
most, if not all, kinds of' cancer, includ-
ing cancer im man:" The Nobel Prize
winner's assertion, of course, was
• grounded on solid evidence ofl the role
_ viruses play in some animal' cancers. At
least three kinds of' leukemia in mice
can be vjrus-indiued, as well as one
type of breast tumor. Working with hu
man blood samples under an electron
microscope, investigators have found
particles in leukemic cells that are indis-
tinguishable from the mouse leukemia
viruses. But no one has yet seen a
virus from a solid human cancer.
New Approach: Searching for the
viruses that may be at work in human
malignancy, Prof. John J. Trentin of
Houston's Baylor University College of
Medicine is using a new approach. In-
stead of looking for viruses in human
cancer cells, he is looking for human
viruses that cause cancer. The Texas re-
searcher has taken various types of
adenovirus-many of which cause re-
spiratory infections in man-and injected
them, one by one, into baby hamsters
and mice. Two types, adenoviruses 12
and 18, produced' highly lethal tumors
in the test animals, he reported last
week. Both types, he noted, infect hu-
mans (nearly half of the persons tested
have antibodies to adenovirus 12), but't
they do not actually produce ill-
ness. "Nb one knows whether they
cause human cancer," Trentin added;
"but we should test all the garden-
variety viruses we can."
When investigating the role of viruses
in cancer, scientists are constantly
amazed by the cunn ing and versatility of
their prey. Bacteria, which harm the
body by creating inflammation or by
secreting poisons, are clumsy by com-
parison to viruses. Because they per-
form their subtle mischief within the
cell,, virus behavior is as complex-and
mysterious-as the process of life. In-
deed,, a virus is only a submicroscopic
speck of nucleic acid-the same sub-
stance that makes up the cell's genetic
material, determines its characteristics,
and controls the production of enzymes,
hormones;, and other essential proteins.
Chemical iiachinerys Once inside
the cell, the virus may take over its
host's chemical machinery in many ways.
It may destroy the cell outright, after
forcing it to produce more viruses, in-
stead of' normal proteins. Or it may, as
Dr. Jonas Salk, famous developer of the
killed-virus polio vaccine explained,
"cause malignant cell changes." We
should, Salk says, think of viruses as.
"infectious molecules," chemicals on
the threshold of life.
External factors may also have an im-
portant bearing on the ability of cancer
viruses to spread infection. Dr. Harry
Rubin of' the University of California
reported at the seminar the Rous sar-
coma virus, which infects chickens, can
cause the growth of malignant cells but
cannot' force the cells to produce other
Rous viruses without the help of another
viral agent. The "helper" virus, which
causes a form~ of leukemia in chicken
flocks, helps the Rous virus acquire the
protein covering it needs to become a
complete infectious particle.
"It is no longer sufficient to think of a
virus in terms of simple infection and
multiplication," concluded Nobelist Stan-
ley. Thus,, as the relationship between
viruses and! cancer becomes clearer, the
picture of viruses themselves grows
more complex.
Stanley
Assume that viruses are responsi6k.

30' THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY does not
fully agree with the answers given to their
arguments in the American Cancer Society's
new pamphlet on cigarette smoking and
pncer.
Commenting on the'booklet, George V.
Allen, president of the Tobacco Institute,
Inc., in Washington, D. C., said: "There is
dispute among scientists as to the causes of
lung cancer. Many differing opinions exist.
This booklet summarizes the vie,,+-s of the
staff of the American Cancer Society, w•hich
have been expressed on'many occasions in
recent years, and are presumably well-
known to the scientific community and the
public. It is our belief that the answers to
questions about diseases such as lung cancer
will, come through the research laboratory,
not through booklets or campaigns for or
against smoking."
The authors of the booklet purport to
answer "point by point" the questions
raised by those who do not accept their
conclusions, Mr. Allen said. He believes the
authors do an injustice to the many scien-
tists, unconnectecl' %%ith the tuh,tcco inelu.-
try, .% ho huld' differing views andi that they
have omitted or urersiinplified facts an(l
theories that do not support their views.
This booklet comes at a time when a eom-
mittee of scientists appointed by the Sur-
geon General of the United States is con-
ducting a~ review which, according to the
Surgeon General, "will Ix. concerned not
only with tobacco but all other factors
which may be involved," he said.
"We hope the Surgeon General's commit-
tee will provide a thorough review of what
is known and what is not known. This type
of approach seems more appropriate than
another booklet restating fixed positions.
"Those of us who work with tobacco
share with the millions who enjoy tobacco
products a concern about questions relating
to tobacco use and certain health problems,
especially lung cancer," Mr. Allen said.
"We recognize that smoking is one of
many factors being investigated by scien-
tists throughout the world who are seekingg
to learn the causes of lung cancer. Many
scientists believe that much more must be
Iearned before it willi be known whether
anV of the factors now under studv has a
role in causation andy if so, whether that role
is direct or indirect, primary or incidental."

BUT MORE striking, said thee
anthropologist, "is the existence
of a consistent graded pattern of
smokers ran about six pounds
heavier than nonsmokers, and
cigar smokers about 10 pounds
heavier.
The physicali measurements
date back to 1942, when the men
entered college. There was no in-
tention then of comparing smoking
habits, and no built-in bias on the
part of the examining doctors.
Anthropologist Seltzer got his
data on smoking by writing to the
graduates in 1959. Of the 922 men

from environmental influences.
On the contrary, he said

By AIISTIN G WEHBWIIN
~ speclYl to Tlw New Taefc 2Uaes..
' CHICAGO, Feb. 22-The big-
ger they are the harder 'they
smoke, a Harvard anthropolug-
tst said today. ,
This polnt was made in the
Journal of the American,Med=
ical Association by Dr. Carl : C:
. Seltzer, a Harvard researeh fei"
low in physical anthropology,
who has a doctorate In that
field.
He said that' there were stat-
isticalily significant differences
In the body build between smok-
ers and nonsmokers and •that
there were physical variations
among the smokers of cigar-
ettes, cigars and pipes. Cigar
smokers, for exampie, were con-
siderably heavier.
• "Smokers are oonaistently
greater than nonsmokere- in
height and weight and in the
dimensions of the head, face,
shoulders, chest, hip, leg and
hand," he said.
Suggesting a genetic (inher-
ited) factor in the reasans why
people be,came a.ddicted to the
tobacco habit, he urged - more
study on a possible relation be-
tween physique, heredity and
lung cancer. '
Dr. Seltzer's data was based
on 922 membess of the F3srvard
College class of 1946.
Twelve measurements had
been made of them as freshmen
In 1942 as part of a regular
medical exa.nination.- These
measurements included height;
ot
weight and the dimmsion9t
the hEad; face, shoulders, chest,
hip, leg and hand.
. . "In every instance the smok-
ers showed larger mean dtmen- :
sions than the nonsmokers," Dr. ;I
Seltzer said in his report.
From this sample he general- °
ized about smokers and non-
smokers, saying: _,;•tir0
"It is clearly evident from ;
the data presented.., that smok- `
ers as a group differ in their '
morphological (organic atruc-
ture) characteristics as young
adults from nor.smoicers. The
differences between them - are
consistent, substantial, and per-'
tain to both dimensions and ,
proportions. +: ' : r^
"What is most striking, how '
ever, is the existence of a cpa-
sistent graded pattern of dif-
ferentiation of the smoker
;
types Into a specific order or
arrangement." He said that the cigarette ;
smokers d:ffered least from '
nonsmokers, followed in degree .
of differentiation by . the pipe
smokers and theT the cigar .
smokers. • • -
Thus, the cigare~`ei smok'e2~s ` `
of 1959 were 4.37 pounds heavier ..
than nonsmokers when they
were In coflege;,, the pipe smok- '
ers outweighed the nonsmokers "
by 6.59 pounds at Harvard and '`
the men who were listed as
otger smokers in 1959 were "
10.41 pounds heavier than their
nonamokine clasSmatPR in 1942. _.
Results at Age of 35
Then, Ln 1959,,when they were
13 years out of college and' aver-
aged 35 years of age, these Har-
vard men, in replies to a ques-
tionnaire, provided Dr. Seltzer
with information on the.ir smok-
ing habits.. The 922 men re-
sponding included 688 smokers
and 234 nonymckers.

That Last Cigarette Might Do It
THIS FRIEND of ours, an
rifti-tobacco fanatic, sat on the
stool next to us at the ham-
burger counter, watching dis-
approvingly as we lit a cigar-
ette and inhaled deeply after a
Pack.
"Vhat just might be the one
to do it," he commented.
•'What do you mean?"
"Well; " he smiied', "You've
beard of the last straw that
breaks the camel's back?"
"Of course."
"There's a same principle in
the matter of cigarettes," our
friend explained. "Doctors say
;a person can smoke up to a
' certain time and point, and still
be safe. But somewhere along
the line, you can light one cigar-
ette too many. Then, bingo-
' you're on your way to lung
cancer. It has to start some-
here, sometime."
Our cigarette was beginning
to be less enjoyable. Having
made his point, our fanatical
friend proceeded to beat' us over
the head with it.
"Some day, some minute,"
he went on, "a smoker reaches
the borderline. If he quits right
there and kicks the habit, he
still quits winner. But if he
lights just one more, he's over
the line and on the high road
to lung cancer, T. B. or maybe
heart trouble - and no turning
back."
"You're a ray of sunshine,"
we said, "Rebecca's twin broth-
er, straight from Sunnybrouk
Farm. You've made this day
happy..
Our friend ignored the sar-
casm and asked, "How much
do you smoke?"'
"A PACK A DAY." we re-
plied, seeing no need to admit'
we also smoke another pack at
night.
"You're hooked, but good,"
he said accusingly. "Down on
your knees begging for trouble.
Why don't you lay off of those
cancer sticks?"
••Get lost,,' we suggested,
rising to depart, throwing our
unfinished cigarette on tile floor
and grinding it underfoot a bit
harder than we Intended.
°Reme•mber," he called after
us. "That last cigarette may
have put you over the border-
line. Or maybe the next one.
Keep in it in mind, bear? Think
about it."
WE'VE KEPT IT In mind,
all right. In fact, we think about
it everytime we reach for ae-
other "cancer stick."
Do you smoke?

auses Clash
Augusta
AUGUSTA (AP) -`The super-

intendent of the Maine Christian

Civic League and tobacco selling

interests clashed head on Tuesday

at a bearing of the legislative
Legal Affairs Committee.

'The matter in dispute was a
bill sponsored by Rep, Cleveland
.P. Curtis, R-Bowdoinham; to out-
-law cigarette vending machines
in Maine.
L e a g u e superintendent, the
,,, Reverend' Benjamin C. Bubar Jr.
spoke in favor of the bill. He
said it was not an anti-cigarette
billl but one designed to xeep
minors under 16 from purchasing
cigarettes.
It was Bubar's contention the
machines in effect "offered" cig-
arettes for sale to anyone, even
those under 16 to whom it is il-
legal to offer to sell cigarettes.
- Charles F. Canning Jr., of the
Pine State Tobacco Co. of Au
gusta; was one of several ciga-
rette vendors and distributors ap-
posing the bill.
He told the committee that all
machines owned by his company
carry signs saying their use by
minors is prohibite&amp; by law.
Canning said vending machine
operators in this way make the
only real attempt being made to
keep children from smoking,.
During the rebuttal period, Bu-
bar said to Canning, "You fei+
lows are telling these legislators
you willi continue to violate the
- law. Signs on the machine don't
count."
Canning asked Bubar if he
thought removing cigarette ma-
chines was the entire answer to
children smokir.g.
"Of course not," said Bubar,
"but' it wrould go a long way."
Bubar admitted he didn't know
what percentage of sales to
minors was by machine.
Capning noted that'in~speaking
for his bill, Curtis turned from
the problem of children smoking
to lung cancer.
_ "The evidence linking cigarettes
to lung cancer is inconclusive,"
Canning said, "'and I feel this
attack on the machines is a way
of trying to get at cigarettes
through -the back door."
James Dailey of the Canteen
Co. of Portland said John Foster
Dulles died of lung cancer and
he didn't smoke.

CANCER
Statistics of Survival
Once they have a clue to the cause of a
'disease, medical researchers often make
steady progress in the search for a cure.
But not~ in the case of hme cancer. T)oc-
tors have lone been cnnvinrra rhar ciea-
e rette .,mokin¢ is aa ma ior. c1li+eP I 1r. !si-
I
Jur. S. Ravdin reminaea a t:alitorma.senii-
nar for science w,,'tcrs, but in the past
decade tite number of fatal cases of lung
' cancer lias - increased alarmingly. Death
rates have shot up i3 %t in men~ and' tV'C
in women. The death rates from other
kinds of cancer have also increased-can-
cer of the kidney, 19% in males, and can-
cer of'the pancreas. 24% ; cancer of the
ovary. i3rlr. And the medical' profession.
said Dr. Ravdin. can offer no explanationn
for the unfortunate statistics.
Speaking as the president of the Ameri-
can Cancer Society. Dr. Ravdin hastened
to add that the news is not all bad. Death
from cancer of the uterus, he reported!
d'eclined by aq -7, during, the past ten years
because of the widespread and'successful
campaign for annual physical checkups
among women and because of the Pap
test, which permits early detection. Mor-
tality from cancer of', the stomach dropped
sharply (32% in men. 36% in women):
perhaps as a result of changed diet.
No Change. The mortality rate of can-
cer of' the colon and rectum could be
much lower than it is. said Dr. Ravdin.
Early detection and prompt, treatment
could save 30.000 of the 40.000 patients
who die from it each year. But for breast
cancer the formula ot early detection and
prompt treatment no longer seems to be
the panacea it once was. "Despite all that
has been done. the death rate from breast
cancer has not changed one bit."
, Leukemia's estimated rise to more than
ig.ooo new cases this year is also dis-
•couraging. But on the basis of overall
progress. said Dr. Ravdin. "we are mak-
ing challenging gains. Last year alone we
saved §ome 44.000 cancer patients who
would have died had they developed the
disease ten years ago. We have the means
at hand to save virtually all of the wom-
en who develop uterine cancer. and given
ideal conditions. salvage those who de-
velop cancer of the colon and rectum."
Other researchers added other statistics
from the war against cancer:
• Leukemia. reported the World Health
Organization. has strange geographic pref-
erences that' might contain some valuable
clues to the origin of the disease. In the
U.S.. mortalityy from leukemia is 50,17;
higher in cities than in rural areas. The
disease generally seems to thrive in a belt
stretching across the north of the coun-
try. particularly west of' the Mississippi.
In New York City, it. occurs twice as
often among the Jewish population as
among Protestants or Roman Catholics.
Mortality from leukemia is high in the
U.S.. Denmark and Israel but relatively
low in France. Ireland. Italy and Japan.
• Vl'ilms's tumor, a cancer that attacks
the kidneys of children and'is often fatall
is yielding to new, treatment. Reporting
at the Cancer Society seminar. Dr. Sid-
ney Farber of Children's Hospital in Bos-
ton said that radiotherapy and surgery
had previous!y been effective in 40% of
cases, but in the other 60% death usually
resulted because the malignancy spread
to the lungs. Now an antibiotic (Actino-
mycin D ) has been brought into the bat-
tle and. combined with surgery and radio-
therapy: the drug has raised the apparent
survival rate to 8i~jo.

~V Our feeling of vague unease
.
is not helped by the ironic word-
; fng of the high school Parent-
'-Teacher Association resolution
;`sapporting the new policy: "Due.
;lto the concern we, as parents,
::feel for the health of our young
people. • "
° To complete the feeling of
: 'juzziness, we understand. that
;some students themselves don't
like the new arrangement be-
i'cause It separates them aceord-
,.ing to building division for the
: oourtyard smoking break, when
they'd like to get out onto the
bus ramp and meet their friends
from other divisions!
The feature which could be the
best or the worst feature of the
new rule 9s _ the need to get a
parental letter in order to smoke.
It could be the best, we think, if
all the parents insist on being
old-fashioned and refuse permis-
sion; and worst if they shrug and
; sign up because It's the easier
thing to do,"

: , WE'VE-M4RD. it_explained,
as we recall, that no-smoking
would be difficult to enforee and
would make "policemen" of
faculty members; that students l
will attempt to 'smoke anyway;
that the administration should
try to be cooperative instead of
Ifighting the students and creat-
ing a hostile atmosphere not
conducive to learning; that there
is disruption to classes in ses-
sion created by the exodus to
the bus ramp; and that the
danger to health of smoking is
taught in. class. ' .;
As we say, it's difficult to
argue the point, since we don't
have to cope with the situation
day by day as the school peo-
ple do, and must rely merely on
our. own knowledge and back-
ground.
Nobody can put his finger on
just when it happened, but i't
does seem that someplace along
the line in our handling of teen-
age problems like smoking we
overstepped the bounds of. what
we used to call common sense.
This is true of parents no less
than school people, here and
elsewhere, and we've all got
some' answering to do to our-
selves. '


SMOKING IS a habit. It
serves no positive purpose_ex
cept providinQ a superficial sort
mounting that it may be harm-
ful to health. It can produce lit-
ter, and can also be annoying to
others when carried out in
cramped. quarters. It can be a
fire hazard. ?
When we went to high school'
-yes, we'll say it again - we
seem to.recall that these: were
enough reasons. Smoking was
OUT. And if'a pupil was caught
smoking he was OUT, too.
Everybody understood it, and
the. faculty was respected. No
compromi'se was made, nor was
i't necessary.
We seem to be afraid to speak
up to our own children nowa-
days. If they won't behave, or
won't learn, we change the
rules so that misbehaving be-
comes 'acceptable -conduct;, or
we make it easier for them to
not-learn.
As, we said, it happened some-
place along the line, and we
sometimes feel sheepish about
making a big to•do about any
new example of permissiveness
toward our children which by it-
self may be difficult to argue
against.
Maybe the time is coming
when somebody will have to be:
a rBal hairshirt and stand up
for what is common sense in-
stead of what L expedient and
the line of least resistance.

Bp CLAYTON RAND,', ~'
With one-third of all high school
students smoking cigarettes, there
is some agitation against the use
of advertising designed to influ-
ence potential smokers of high
school age.
, I remember vividly the first' cig-
arette advertisement that W
peared with an appeal to women.
A puffing young man appeared'
in the picture on a billboard with
his cutie. She had her little pug
nose lifted, and the only words
appearing in the advertisement
were, "Blow Some My Way." ".
One boy in five begins smoking
by the time he's in the ninth
grade in high school, and almost
30 per cent of all girls smoke be-
fore they're grad,uated. This ten-
dency of cigarette smokers to be-

countries are curtailing or pro-

I STAYED ON CORNSILK until I was 13
and went to high school. At that time, I gave
up the fight. All my contemporaries were
sneaking cigarettes and playing snooker pool.
And' so did I. I was not very good at hiding the evidence.
My mother caught me within a month. We.
had a tearful session and I promised to give
them up. We agreed that 13 waa too young. _
It made a good Impression on me and I
didn't start again until I was 14.

With one-third of all high school
students smoking cigarettes, there
is some agitation against the use
of advertising designed to influ-
ence potential smokers of high
school age.
, I remember vividly the first' cig-
arette advertisement that W
peared with an appeal to women.
A puffing young man appeared'
in the picture on a billboard with
his cutie. She had her little pug
nose lifted, and the only words
appearing in the advertisement
were, "Blow Some My Way." ".
One boy in five begins smoking
by the time he's in the ninth
grade in high school, and almost
30 per cent of all girls smoke be-
fore they're grad,uated. This ten-
dency of cigarette smokers to be-
come younger is w h y several
countries are curtailing or pro-
hibiting cigarette advertisiag.
With mray a huff and a puff
statistics show that tabarco pro-
duces a serious hazara to nealth.
Cigarettes may be killer-dillers,
but where would television be
without them? We who enjoy the
programs and resist t h e com-
mercials get a bargain. :here are
more people killed every day or,
television than die smoking.

Exaert Defends Cigare#s
There is plenty of t~t~om for argument
on the ciaaret smoking habit and the ap-
parent increase in cancer, and particu-
larlv lung cancer. The weight of evidence
still is that all air pollution, Including car
tur.ies, must be considered as, playing a
part in the increase of lung cancer.
I,ast week a distinguished cancer spe-
cialict. Dr. Ian Macdonald, University of
Califnrnia, said modern crusaders In sci-
ence and medicine are trying to get.an
official condemnation -of ciaaret smok-
ing by the American Coile¢e of Surgeons.
He said no biological link has been
established which will stand up under
scientific Investigation to show that
c+aaret smoking causes lung cancer.
But the eventual stroke at, cigarets
may come when the new Kennedy drug

they contain nicotine.

Augusta
AUGUSTA (AP) -`The super-

intendent of the Maine Christian

Civic League and tobacco selling

interests clashed head on Tuesday

at a bearing of the legislative
Legal Affairs Committee.

'The matter in dispute was a
bill sponsored by Rep, Cleveland
.P. Curtis, R-Bowdoinham; to out-
-law cigarette vending machines
in Maine.
L e a g u e superintendent, the
,,, Reverend' Benjamin C. Bubar Jr.
spoke in favor of the bill. He
said it was not an anti-cigarette
billl but one designed to xeep
minors under 16 from purchasing
cigarettes.
It was Bubar's contention the
machines in effect "offered" cig-
arettes for sale to anyone, even
those under 16 to whom it is il-
legal to offer to sell cigarettes.
- Charles F. Canning Jr., of the
Pine State Tobacco Co. of Au
gusta; was one of several ciga-
rette vendors and distributors ap-
posing the bill.
He told the committee that all
machines owned by his company
carry signs saying their use by
minors is prohibite&amp; by law.
Canning said vending machine
operators in this way make the
only real attempt being made to
keep children from smoking,.
During the rebuttal period, Bu-
bar said to Canning, "You fei+
lows are telling these legislators
you willi continue to violate the
- law. Signs on the machine don't
count."
Canning asked Bubar if he
thought removing cigarette ma-
chines was the entire answer to
children smokir.g.
"Of course not," said Bubar,
"but' it wrould go a long way."
Bubar admitted he didn't know
what percentage of sales to
minors was by machine.
Capning noted that'in~speaking
for his bill, Curtis turned from
the problem of children smoking
to lung cancer.
_ "The evidence linking cigarettes
to lung cancer is inconclusive,"
Canning said, "'and I feel this
attack on the machines is a way
of trying to get at cigarettes
through -the back door."
James Dailey of the Canteen
Co. of Portland said John Foster
Dulles died of lung cancer and
he didn't smoke.

cool overhanging trees ., the pounding surf of the ocean,
mountain brooks, swimming pools (did you ever try to smoke

nicotine ... proving you were neurotic or at most a weakling
unaccustomed to fresh air?
Look the ads over as you watch your TV sets tonight and -
irnag3ne what' effect they have on your healthy children with
the pure sweet natural breath of youth. The ads keep stressing
the exhilarating "taste" of cigarettes - cool, fresh, Spring-
time, refreshes your taste, softeness in every puff, refreshing,
refines harsh flavor, rough taste. i
The great attraction in smoking is it slows down the blood
circulation and one might find a smoke is good for the nerves,
but .., since It is a depressant it does not fit in with strong
activity of the great outdoors. How can you enjoy a cool fresh
breeze when your nose, throat and lungs are. permeated with
smoke and smoke's residue, soot? How• can you enjoy the
morning air when your throat is clogged with phlegm and you

SWEDE DOES SPADEWORK
N STOP-SMOKING CLINIC
By Earl Ubell
Science Editor

' LA JOLLA, Calif.
-cannot. His clinic treatment
.-would help them, he said.
In Sweden his method
achieved "good" results In 95
per cent of the cases, he said.
One out of five stop smoking
the first day. Half gradually
taper off and stop altogether;
making a total of three out
of four who give up the weed
entirely.
Another one In five cut hia
smoking to not more than 35
smoke irritates the lung lining
producing, in a sense an itch.
"To relief the itch they •
must scratch," he said, "and
the only way to scratch your
lung is with more smoke."
Then Dr. Ejrup also gives
them daily Injections of nico-
tine or a nicotine substitute
called lobeline hydrochloride.
His idea is to Induce a feel-
dng of smoking saturation, as
In Sweden Dr. Bode Ejrup's
colleagues thought he was
crazy. "What!" they told
him, "start a cifnic for wean-
ing people from tobacco?
You'll ruin your career. Be-
sides. it's of no importance
medically." That was seven
years ago. Today, after help-
ing almost 5,500 persons in
Sweden stop the cigarettee
or cut it down drastically, Dr.
Ejrup. now the world's lead-
ing authority on the subject,
has demonstrated its medical
lmportance.
When he started the first of
his six tobacco withdrawal
clinics in Stockholm, he
couldn't get any financial
support. so he had to charge
the patients about $10 for the
ten-day course of treatment.
"That turned out to be a
good thing," Dr. Eirup told a
seminar of science writers
sponsored by the American
Cancer Society. "the payment
provided some additional
motivation to stop smoking."
Linced to Maladies
Of course. the Cancer So-
ciety's interest in Dr. Ejrup
lies in the Society's continuing
campaign against cigarettes
as a cause of lung cancer. But
Dr. Ejrup had no interest in
preventing cancer. He merely
wanted to reduce symptoms
'ILom which many c!garette
smokers suffered. Dr. Ejrup. a
member of the Karolinska In-
stitute, discovered that nine
out of ten patients had some
current medical complaint for
which they wanted to stop
smoking, but couldn't. 1\4ost'
often their poor physicallcon-
dition prompt,ed' their move to
stop. Or else they were ner-
vous, had chronic bronchitis
or inflamation, of the mouth,
among other complaints.
OriQinally„Dr. Ejrup started
the clinics because of his in-
terest in heart diseases and
because of the known effect
of nicotine and cigarette
smoke on the heart. Many
patients came to the clinic for
heart troubie: as w•e11..
- According to his figures, Dr.
Ejrup said that there must be
some 8 million persons in the
United Statcs at this moment
vkho kaeit to stop cigarette
•mnking Iur lliese reasons but
lf the patient had smoked
more cigarettes than normal.
This produces a distaste for
the cigarette and helps break
the habit pattern. He also
uses tranquflizers and appe-
tite-killers.
Six months after the treat-
ment, 50 per cent' still showed
good results, he said. The re-
lap$e patients often return
to pipe. Cigars or smoke only
a few cigarettes. The relapsPs
usually occur under heavyy
psychological stress, he said.
per cent of original consump-,
tion. In some cases "habitu-
ated smokers" have turned
into "pleasure smokers: " he
said. That means two or three
cigarettes a day, rather than
two packs a day.
Result of Inhalins
As a result, Dr. Ejrup has
cut back the unpleasant
symptoms of heavy smokind.
For many breathing has be-
come easy; heart symph,oms
have died down and their
sense of taste and smell has
turned after years of absence. •
Dr. E)rup i;as no magic. He
combines edtlcation; psycho-
logical methqds, drugs, train-
ing to new liabits and' con-
.stant moral support by thee
clinic person}tel. Each patient
starts his ten-day treatment
with a one-hour discussion of
cigarete smoking that covers
in detail the patient's own
smoking pattern, the psychol-
ogy of smoking and the phy-
sical effects. 'He also hands
them a book on the subject.
For example. Dr. Ejrup said
most patients don'tl realize
why they inhale, although
they think it is for better
taste. Actuall5, the thick

Oregon Health Board
Hits Smoking; Sets
'Education' Budget ~
PoaTnArtD, OaE., March 19-Cig-
aret smokers in Oregon received a
second state-sprung blow when the
Oregon board of health passed a
resolution condemning the habit
of cigaret smoking and termed it
`harmful."'
The board's action came at a
, time when the state legislature is
studying various measures which
, would tax cigarets. Oregon at pres-
ent has no state tax on cigarets,
cigars or pipe tobacco.
Officials of the board said they
knew of no other state to have
taken such action condemning
smoking.
.Z'he board's resolution stated
that "a preponderance of scientific
and clinical evidence indicates an
adverse relationship between cig-
aret smoking and chronic bronchi-
tis, emphysema, heart and circula-
tory diseases, asthma, and cancer
of the lungs, mouth and heart."
 The board voted to expend $3,-
425 in funds to help educate the
public about the "harmful effectb
of cigaret smoking on health."
In connection with the Oregon
Heart Assn.,, the state medical so-
ciety, the Oregon division of the
American Cancer Society, the Ore-
gon TB Society, and Oregon State
University, three educational ses-
sions will be held this c o m i n g

The resolution, which is ex-

"Whereas, the prepond'er-

that cigarette smoking is a
tnajor cause of lung cancer
and is also associated with

"Whereas, the Medical So-

State Hits
Smoking
_
; By MARGE DAVENPORT
Journal Staff Writer
Oregon may be the firsl
atate to take an official stand'
against cigaret smoking!
The State Board of Health
at its Wednesday meeting in
l5alem passed resolutions con-
demning the habit and label-
ing it "harmful."
American Cancer Society
headquarters in New
York told The Journal that it
knew of no other state that
had taken such action.
The Board of Health's action
came at the same time the
State Legislature is eyeing:
cigarets as a source of possi-
ble tax revenue. Oregon is
one of the few states that is in
the unique position of not hav-
ing an existing cigaret tax or
having a farm economy in
which tabocco raising plays a•
role.
At an all-day health board
a e s s i'o n held at Fairview
Home, the board also voted
approval of the expenditure of
$3,825 in funds to help edu-
cate the public about the
"harmful effects of cigaret
smoking on health."
Following a lively discussion.
about the wording of the to-
bacco disapproval resolutions,
the board finally agreed that
"a preponderance of scienti-
fic. and clinical evidence indi-
cates an adv erse relationship
between cigaret smoking and
chronic bronchitis, emphy-
sema, heart and circulatory
diseases. asthma, and cancer
of the lungs, mouth and
throat."
In connection with the Ore-
gon Heart Association, the
State Medical Society, the TB
and Health Association, the
Oregon Division of the Amer-
ican Cancer Society and.Ore-
Ron State University, three
educational sessions wil be
held this coming spring on
the subject of smoking.

2a. R. W. Apple Jr. is writ'ing,a book tentatively titled "The Tobacco Crisis" for
publication by J. B. Lippincott Company in mid-196k. So far as is known, Apple has
not yet initiated contact with the industry. He is a 29-year-old writer who has been
connected with the staff of the National Broadcasting Company program "The Huntley-
Brinkley Report." He recently wrote a Saturday Review article on the controversial
book "Calories Don't Count." He formerly worked for the Wall Street Journal.
A recent publisher's announcement of Apple's book said it would "examine the
development of the American tobacco industry and the mores of smoking, and will
include an intensive studyof recent medical research and the industry's response to it."
The release also states, "The book's concluding section will suggest what effects --
political, economic and social -- might follaw from definitive medical conclusions."

. THE CHARIATTE OBSERVER
Charlotte; N.C. °
March 24, 1963
The month of April is com-
ing up. It is a month of show-
ers to help get the spring
" llowers off and running.
It is also a month for another
- type of showers-dollars to fur-
ther the cause of research in
the never-ending fight to com-
bat cancer in man.
Each April, the American
Cancer Society conducts this
campaign to raise money for
research. Investigators the na-
tion over-from the small one-
man laboratory to the great
medical centers-usually re-
ceive grants to keep the .bat-'tle going.
Cancer Is not the great kill-
.er of man-but it' is one of the
top criminals. Scientists, work-
ing under grants of the Amer-
': tcan Cancer Society, have
turned up many new research
weapons to aid medical science
In the battle against the di-
. sease.
• As had been said, early diag-
- .nosis and prompt treatment are
tqe two most effective weap-
ons and they have brought
cures.
' 7k ~It *
. THERE WAS' A TIME-not
.80 many years ago-when in-m vestigators who believed that
: a virus was involved in the
cause of cancer were ridi-
. culed. But today, more and
more investigators are coming
around to the idea that can-
• cerous growths may be the re-
sult of a virus.
- Of course, - the scientists
tnobv the cause of cancer.
:; The cause is that normal
cells of the body stop their
natural and orderly reproduc-
' tion and become uncontrolled,
: like weeds in a garden that
-crowd out the desirable plants
unless destroyed or pulled out.
Bnt the anderlying prob-
lem is what causes these hn-
man cells to go haywire.

This is what the scientists,
working with grants from the
American Cancer Society, are
trying to determine. They have
t been at the project for many
years, and sooner or later will
come up with the -answer.
The answer may never be a
cure. for cancer-but a means
of control, such as in the case
of diabetes, where the patient
can live with his cancerous
condition and probably die of
something else. .

s Challenged
Medical Tribune- World Wide Report
SAN MATEO, CALIP.-Cigarette smoking is
a°dirty, stinking, expensive habit," but no
.one yet has proved it causes lung cancer-
and those who say so are "victims of mass
hysteria." '
People bent on the control of tubercu
losis, limited as they are by stringent
budgets, should aim their case-finding
: efforts at the 65-year-old male alcoholic or
•: schizophrenic of noncaucasian descent.
. These two statements - one made in
serious certainty, the other half in jest as
an ideal imaginary model of statistical evi-
dence - emerged from the joint annual
meetings of the Tuberculosis and Health
Association of California and the Califor-
nia nia Thoracic Society.
'`-The man who vigorously denied the
.validity of claims that there is a causal
'relationship between smoking and lung
cancer was Dr. LeRoy Hyde, chief of pui
monary disease service at the Long Beach
(Calif.) Veterans Hospital and Assistant
Clinical Professor of Medicine - at the
U.C.L.A. School' of Medicine.
The portrait of the most likely victim
! of TB came from Dr. Buford Burch, chief
of thoracic surgery and assistant superin-
tendent of the Chest Center at Patton State
Hospital, a California mental hospital.
Horses vs. TB
Dr. Hyde reminded 'his fellow physi-
ciahs that some of the leading members
.of their profession once believed' that
pellagra was an infectious disease, that
."typhoid and typhus were different varie-
ties of the same fever," and that "horse-
back riding was a good treatment for TB."
"To this list," he said flatly, "may be
added the statement that cigarette smoking
causes lung eancer."'
Any attempt to causally associate ciga-
rette smoking and lung cancer must ex-
plain these findings, Dr. Hyde said:
l. Death rates for lung cancer among
urban dwellers are significantly higher
than among strictly comparable rural
groups, smoking habits not withstanding
-with industrial dusts and air pollution
appearing to play a part.
2. ln both America and England, lung
cancer mortality among men in the higher
social' classes is significantly less than for
other classes. 3. Spontaneous lung cancer has been
described in "nonsmoking animals and
humans."
4. Lung cancer has increased both in
countries where cigarette consumption has
gone up tremendously (the U. S., Canada,
and Italy) and' in countries where it has
remained fairly stationary ( ,Ciermany,
Atistria, Turkey, and Japan).
5. Lung cancer has been induced in
Dr. Burch's exaggeratedly typical
'
victim was used to emphasize his point ;;;
' that control of the disease through case
finding could best and most economically ''
be aimed at what he called "hot spots
;' These are some of the statistics on ~
which he based his point:
Age: in 1950 most tuberculosis was
found in the 35-45 age group; today most
,of it occurs iii the 65-75 age group.
. Sex: in 1950 there were many more
'.women than men with active TB; today's
laboratory animals by using human adeno- . incidencee is two to one in favor of men.
vtruses.
6. Smokers differ from nonsmokers in
various "psychologic variables," such as
occupation, residence, annual income, fre-
Alcoholisrh and mental illness: in Dr.
IBurch's Patton State Hospital, which
handles most di the TB patients among the
alcoholics and mentally ill (California
quency of automobile accidents, number mental hospitals treat both), the active
of psychosomatic symptoms, coffee con- tuberculosis incidence is 300 per 100,000, '
sumption, social mobility, etc.. - 10 times the California rate of 30 per
7. Experiments strongly support the,100,000. He said he had no breakdown ,
thesis that chromosome abnormalitiesplayi between alcoholics and schizophrenics but
a significant role in most cancer. , insisted that the rates for both were high.'
8. A large part, if not most, of the
apparent increase in certification of deathh
due to lung cancer can be accounted foi
by changes in medical practice and deatl
certification.
9. No one holds that drinking causes
tuberculosis, yet as exact a correlation be-
tween alcohol consumption and TB as
between smoking and lung cancer can be
plotted.
10. Lung cancer is twice as common in
British men as in American men, although
cigarette consumption is only half as great
.in England as in the U. S.
" My comments," Dr. Hyde concluded,
"should in no way be construed as an
argument for smoking. There is no doabt
that cigarette smoking may be harmful to
certain people, such as those with pul-
monary emphysema, bronchial asthma,
and anybody with coughs. However, the
causal relationship of cigarette smoking to
lung cancer is certainly unproved."
(Dr. Hyde told MEDICAL TR[BUNE he
had smoked a cigarette once in his life-
at age eight. )
Race: the TB incidence among Negroes "'
and Mexican-Americans in California is
two to three times that for the total popu- '
lation; amofig Orientals it is three to four
5. :
times higher.

~:The American Cancer 8o-
eSety annual report for 1983, re-
`asd td present an op
seeoay,s-
thmtstic picture of medicine's
progress against leukemia.
"Many scientista think leu-
: temia may yield man's next
victory over cancer " the Teport
says. "Many believe that the
'' diaease is caused by a virus,
.legding to the expectation that
' a method will be discovered to
eure or prevent it. . . . _
-'2eukemia research already
has , demonstrated that the
malignant process, once re-
garded as lrreversibleH can be
asrested by drugs. . . . . . °
Two and three-year remis-
alons are • no longer unuaual
with one form of the disease,
according to some experts. The
annual report says the victim
of acute leukemia today lives
#i comfort an average of 14
months, as opposed to, four i
months.
Psyebologic4 Problems
This has proved a mixed bless-
$tQ, however, for the proepecte
- of eventual death creates pay-
eboiogicai problems for both
the victim and his family. Ex-
penses also : mount and large
quantities at blood are often
needed.
- The society has spent nearly
i9 rhiBion on leukemia-related
l'eaearch In the last five years.

Although the society Is mainly
for the support of research, the;
report says a survey le now un-
derway to determine what help
can be organized for the leu-
kemia patient and his "finan-
cially buffeted family °
In other work, the society
said it has now reached more
than half the Nation's second-
ary schools with teaching kits
on smoking and lung cancer.
40,800 to Die
Lung cancer, the annual re-
port estimates, will kill 40,800
Americans this year. It further
estimates that at leaat 'fb per
cent of the deaths were un-
necessary-and could have been
avoided by abstinence from
cigarettes.
In leukemia research, sup-
ported by :2,039,047 from the
aociety last year, work is being
done with a, wide variety of
animals-including rats, bac-
Duke
teria and cows. And at
University, a physician is ex-
ploring a possible link between
chicken leukemia and human
,leukemia.
The District division of the
society is one of nine cited in
the report for "vigor.. . . at
grassroots levels.'' The division
was cited because of its "extra-
ordinarily Inclusive" profes-
sional education programs for
physicians, dentists, nurses and
medical students.

The resolution, one of manyy
dealing with a wide range of
subjects which will be consid-

to take place "particularly in
schools and homes."
Another rpsolutinn up for
consideration hit.s at the
"practice of governmental
agencies and insurance com-
panies" asking that physi-
cians certify to the fitness'

persons.

It recommends "that phNs sici3ns shall set forth on such

To Teen-Age Smokers
' The California Medical Association
decided last week that it could wait no
longer for the U.S. Surgeon General's
panel on smoking to complete its defin-
itive study of the possible role of ciga- •
rettes in lung cancer and heart disease.
At its annual meetingin Los Angeles, the _
association voted to "publicize the hana- "
ful effect of smoking." In the next few
months, the CMA will draw up an "edu-
cational" campaign directed' at teen-
agers, possibly involving distribution of
anti-smoking posters and pamphlets. ;:~..
The resolution-the first adopted by
any state medical society-stemmed from
a survey of evidence linking cigarette
smoking to disease by the association's
Cancer Commission. The commission's
report, said Dr. Eugene Miller, noted
that factors such as air pollution might
also be involyed, but concluded that
a strong "causal relationship" exists be-
tween smoking and lung cancer.

"Many scientista think leu-

In other work, the society
said it has now reached more
than half the Nation's second-
ary schools with teaching kits
on smoking and lung cancer.
40,800 to Die
Lung cancer, the annual re-
port estimates, will kill 40,800
Americans this year. It further
estimates that at leaat 'fb per
cent of the deaths were un-
necessary-and could have been
avoided by abstinence from
cigarettes.
In leukemia research, sup-
ported by :2,039,047 from the
aociety last year, work is being
done with a, wide variety of
animals-including rats, bac-
Duke
teria and cows. And at
University, a physician is ex-
ploring a possible link between
chicken leukemia and human
,leukemia.
The District division of the
society is one of nine cited in
the report for "vigor.. . . at
grassroots levels.'' The division
was cited because of its "extra-

THE SMOKER'S
LATEST. ENEMY
By Earl Ubell
Seience Editor
LA JOLLA, Calif.
Cigarettes have spread a
new plague through our
population, scientists have
discovered. It is an epidemic
of emphysema, a lung ail-
ment that leaves its victims
gasping for breath. The evi-
dence comes from the mi-
croscope. Slices of lung from
smokers and non-smokers
revealed' drastic differences
In the air sacs and blood ves-
sels. The smoker's lung
showed severe damage.
All this came out in the
closing session of the Ameri-
can Cancer Society's annual
seminar for science writers.
While the society Is in-
terested in cancer, the em-
physema story came out of
the research as a by-product.
Dr. Oscar Auerbach of the
Veterans Administration
Hospital, East Orange, N. J.,
t.old how he and three as-
sociates had studied smoking
In lungs in 1,500 men who
had diPd at the Veterans
Hasnital between 1955 and
19e0.
His verdiet; "We are be-
coming a nation of lung crip-
ples."
The microscopic examina-
tion was carried out by Dr.
Auerbach and Dr. Arthur
Purdy Stout, one of the
world's leading experts on the
microscopic analysis of tissue.
The statistical work was done
by Dr. E. Cuyler Hammond
chief statistician for the Can-
cer Society, and Dr. Lawrence
darfinkel. -
The charts and graphs told
the story clearly. First, there
was the microscopic sign of
the rupturing of the air aaca.
The men who had never
smoked had little or no rup-
turing. The men who did had
a high degree of breakage,
which increased sharply with
age and the amount of amok-
ing they did.
P'or example, at age 45 or
younger one-third of the
men who smoked more than
two packs a day had many
ruptured air sacs. At' age 60,
nine out of ten of these men
had broken air sacs. Even
those who smoked less than a
paek a day had increasing
lung liability, rising to half
the men at age 60. The non-
smokers had next to nothing.
Dr. Auerbach showed sim-
ilar pictures for the thicken-
ing of the air sac walls, for
the narrowing of the small
and large arteries and for the
other microscopic aspects of
emphysema. All this means
that with increasing age the
men find it more difficult to
breathe.
Previously, Dr. Auerbach
had suggested that similar
lung changes accounted for
the high heart attack rate in
heavy smokers. His Idea was
that some other disease af-
fected the heart first-for ex-
ample, coronary artery nar-
rowing--and then the smoke-
afflicted lungs embarrassed
the weakened heart, making
it work harder and perhaps
triggering a heart attack.
In all the studies, those
who were best off were the
non-smokers, next came the
cigar and plpe-smokera and
worst were the heavy cigar-
Eite smokers. , •

A Long Beach physician

failed to prove that cigarette

Dr. Leroy Hyde added that

DR. HYDE'S report, al-
ready delivered to local medi-
groups and soon to be pub-
lished in a medical journal,
has jolted medical circles.
Significance of the report'
is that Dr. Hyde is chief of
the pulmonary disease service
of Long Beach Veterans Ad-
ministration Hospital - a fa-
cility believed' to see as many
lung-cancer victims as any
other hospital in the world.
Dr. Hyde said' his observa-
tions are not based on his
own research but rather on a
review of reports in medical
literature.

HE WILL give a detailed
report on his stand at the
merous othef research find-
ings before they can prove a

Dr. Hyde asserted.
Some of the findings which
he says many scientists have
ignored:
Reports which show lung
cancer has developed spon-
taneously in nonsmoking ani-
mals.
Statistics which show lung

THE SMOKER'S
LATEST. ENEMY
By Earl Ubell
Seience Editor
LA JOLLA, Calif.
Cigarettes have spread a
new plague through our
population, scientists have
discovered. It is an epidemic
of emphysema, a lung ail-
ment that leaves its victims
gasping for breath. The evi-
dence comes from the mi-
croscope. Slices of lung from
smokers and non-smokers
revealed' drastic differences
In the air sacs and blood ves-
sels. The smoker's lung
showed severe damage.
All this came out in the
closing session of the Ameri-
can Cancer Society's annual
seminar for science writers.
While the society Is in-
terested in cancer, the em-
physema story came out of
the research as a by-product.
Dr. Oscar Auerbach of the
Veterans Administration
Hospital, East Orange, N. J.,
t.old how he and three as-
sociates had studied smoking
In lungs in 1,500 men who
had diPd at the Veterans
Hasnital between 1955 and
19e0.
His verdiet; "We are be-
coming a nation of lung crip-
ples."
The microscopic examina-
tion was carried out by Dr.
Auerbach and Dr. Arthur
Purdy Stout, one of the
world's leading experts on the
microscopic analysis of tissue.
The statistical work was done
by Dr. E. Cuyler Hammond
chief statistician for the Can-
cer Society, and Dr. Lawrence
darfinkel. -
The charts and graphs told
the story clearly. First, there
was the microscopic sign of
the rupturing of the air aaca.
The men who had never
smoked had little or no rup-
turing. The men who did had
a high degree of breakage,
which increased sharply with
age and the amount of amok-
ing they did.
P'or example, at age 45 or
younger one-third of the
men who smoked more than
two packs a day had many
ruptured air sacs. At' age 60,
nine out of ten of these men
had broken air sacs. Even
those who smoked less than a
paek a day had increasing
lung liability, rising to half
the men at age 60. The non-
smokers had next to nothing.
Dr. Auerbach showed sim-
ilar pictures for the thicken-
ing of the air sac walls, for
the narrowing of the small
and large arteries and for the
other microscopic aspects of
emphysema. All this means
that with increasing age the
men find it more difficult to
breathe.
Previously, Dr. Auerbach
had suggested that similar
lung changes accounted for
the high heart attack rate in
heavy smokers. His Idea was
that some other disease af-
fected the heart first-for ex-
ample, coronary artery nar-
rowing--and then the smoke-
afflicted lungs embarrassed
the weakened heart, making
it work harder and perhaps
triggering a heart attack.
In all the studies, those
who were best off were the
non-smokers, next came the
cigar and plpe-smokera and
worst were the heavy cigar-
Eite smokers. , •

There is plenty of t~t~om for argument
on the ciaaret smoking habit and the ap-
parent increase in cancer, and particu-
larlv lung cancer. The weight of evidence
still is that all air pollution, Including car
tur.ies, must be considered as, playing a
part in the increase of lung cancer.
I,ast week a distinguished cancer spe-
cialict. Dr. Ian Macdonald, University of
Califnrnia, said modern crusaders In sci-
ence and medicine are trying to get.an
official condemnation -of ciaaret smok-

He said no biological link has been
established which will stand up under
scientific Investigation to show that
c+aaret smoking causes lung cancer.
But the eventual stroke at, cigarets
may come when the new Kennedy drug

Careful reading of the presentations of both ~cdical scientific committee,
sides indicates that the Cancer Society has made
the stronger case. The booklet points out that,

"that there in a hig(t degree of relationship

offers the purely negative argument "that the

least a strong possibility that cigarette smoking

for the twentyfold increase in the death rate

Lam p Out in Mill bury?
By STANLEY E. PACEK
Telegram Staff Reporter
MILLBURY - Selectmen,
brushing the cobwebs away from
sections of the General Laws,
Iast night' announced a campaign
to curb smoking' amoug Mill-
bury teen-agers.
The campaign - with the co-
vperation of tobacco retailers -
vvi11 begin. today. .
Selectmen said they have seen
youngsters as young as 10 years
smoking in the.t&lt;own~ streets and
at teen•age dances.
. Age Ban Cited
"Maybe these youngsters are
aot alvare that, the law pro-
hibits the sale of cigarettes to
anyone under 18 years old, and
other forms of tobacco (in•
cluding snuff) to anyone under
16 years of age. But it's been
on the books for a long time,"
charman Richard P. Dwi-
nell said.
Police Chief Howard R. White
found that Sections 6 and 7.
Chapter 270; of the General
Laws - passed in 1886 - re-
quire tobacco dealers to, post
certain notices.
_ Selectmen told White._tq have
his • day patrolmen deliver pos-
ter-size sections of these laws
to establishments where tobac-
co is sold. The posters will 15e
delivered today and merchants.
and others will be asked to put'
them up in a conspicuous
place. _
One section of the law pro-
vides for a fine of not more
than $50 for '•'whoever sells a
cigarette to a person under 18,,
or whoever sells snuff or tobac-
co in any of its forms to any
person* under 16, or not being,
his parent or guardian, gives
e cigarette to a person under
18, or gives snuff or tobacco
in any of its forms to a per-
ton under 16."
Another section of Chapter 270
eeys that if the owner or per-
son in•uharge of a store that re-
tails cigarettes fails to post this
section of the law in a con-
spicuous place, he is liable to
a:fine of not more than $50.
In short, 'a retailer could be
#loed-vp to $100 - if he sold
cigarettes 16 a person under 18
years of age and if he did
ltiot have these sections of thee
law pristed,
MILLBURY OFFICIALS PREPARE TO POST CIGARETTE LAW
Selectmen William J. Gibson (left) and Frederick E. Lucas
The law alto authorizes a fine
of,-up to ;10, for unlawfully re-
moving a posted section of the
law while the store is being
used for the sale of cigarettes.
School Aid Sought
"'The School Department is
pretty strict about enforcilg no
smoking signs at the schools. I
feel certain they will go along
with us in trying to curb smok-
ing among teen-agers throughout
the town," Dwinell said.
He estimated there are about
25 places of business that sell
cigarettes - either across the
counter or by vending ma-
chines.
In other business, selectmen
voted unanimously to reject the
application of the Doi'othy Man-
or Progressive Club for•a change
in its managership.
8 Oppose Application
"We feeli the club no longer
serves the purpose for wfiich
it' was charterel," Dwinell' said.
Prior to the vote a delegation
of eight persons who live near
the club objected to lthe applica-
tion.
Mrs. Jennie M. Costello of 27
Wheelock Ave: said "the club
is ac public nuisance and is not
a place for people to live nean
to."
Bernard G. O'Grady of 45 Epp-
fng St., said he understood the
club was supposed to be a corn-
munity itrlprovement..
Financial Difficulty
Stanley Wilczynski said the
club was first formed in the
1940s for the purpose of com-
munity betterment.
"The betterment' never came
...it turned' out to be a detri-
ment," Wilczynski' said.
The meeting brought out that
the club was in financial diffi•
culty to which Wilczynski ex-
pressed dismay.
"The club started out with a
sound membership and did' not
have to pay, taxes . . . I don't
know how the club could run
into financiall trouble," he said
The club application sought a
change in the managership
from James Cristo of 4 Wheel-
ock Aue. to Edward F:.Kendor
Jr. of 4 Echo St., Worcester.
Last week, Walter J. Moosa, a
Worcester attorney•and spokes-
man for the club, urged select-
men to approve the application
in the best interests of the town,

Dr. Overholt said stop-

TfIE MEDICAL EVjuENCE of. that. certainly no more than one
the relationship between smoking
and diseases cannot be Ignored
; wisely, , But I do not want to go
to the other extreme and imply1 that smoking of • any kind in any
` amquno is dangerous. Physicians,must remember that
not all smokers die of lung can-
cer and not all lung cancer deaths
lnvolve smokers. They also must
consider that most of the lung
cancer (and other cancer) deaths
occur in the later years of life,
between the ages of fifty and
seventy. Some authorities feel
that the growing incidence of
total cancer is merely a reflectfon
of better investigative and re-
cording techniques for lung can-
cer and of an Increasing pop-
ulation which is tending year
after year to get top heavy in
the upper-age,'brackets.
The present' annual death rate
hom all forms of cancer is about
150 deaths out of every 100,000
Americans. This is approximately
16 per cent of the overall death
rate. The death rate of lung can-
cer, however; ls about 36 out of
every 100,000 Americans. (The
break down is : 31 males and
S females.) This fs approximately
2.2 per cent of the over-all death
rate. Therefore, while lung can-
cer is certainly a serious disease,
its over-all Incidence Is not as
great as is generally believed.
In the light of these facts, it
you feel you can afford or de-
sire to take a risk, and if you
do derive pleasure from smok-
fng, then I think the risk is not
too great if you smoke mod-
erately. • ,
What 1i moderate smoking3
Nobody can lay down a hard
and fast •rulse wisely. I would say
package of cigarettes a day (or
a comparable amount of tobacco
in pipe and cigar smoking) might
be considered a moderate habit.
Apart from the• lung cancer as-
aociation, there is, 'I believe,
another Important reason why
you should moderate your smok-
ing habits. If you smoke too
much you are subjecting yourself
to excessive stimulation. This can
cheat you of a sense of well-
being just as surely -as if you
took too much sedation '~
If you smoke without modera-
tion, you are not really _getting
pleasure. You are just a slave
to •. a habit. s` ,
gmoking and Heart Disease
:: From the available evidence, it
would seem quite apparent that
smoking does have . an unfav-
orable influence on the coronary
circulation. As a matter of fact,
the famous Hammond-Horn , re-
port on the relationship of cancer
and smoking stirred so many
emotions and headlines over the
lung cancer situation that one of
the report's most significant find-
ings was virtually ignored by the
lay public. This was the finding
that showed the probability of
pPahaps a more definite aFso-
ciation between smoking and cor-
onary disease. While the report
showed lung cancer to be asso-
ciated with 13.5 per cent of the
deaths in excess of the normal'
rate, coronary disease was asso-
ciated with over 50 per cent of the
"excess deaths."
Anyone can stop smoking with
comparatively little unhappiness
If a sufficiently good reason for
stopping is present. If you. are
` truly worried about your health,
that ought to be more than
enough reason. .

~TI I DOME
~`(Montly School Paper at the Penn®ylvania
Despite mounting evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship be-
tween smoking and lung cancer, cigarette companies continue to lure
young people into "the wonderful world of smoking" and sizeable aeg-
ments of the American public continue to ignore the poteAial dangers.
This terrifying statistic from an American Public Health Association
. study states: More than one million children now in school will die of "
lung cancer before they reach the age of 70.
" In 1961 alone, only six major cigarette companies spent more than
141 million dollars promoting their products. Much of this promotion is
directed at young people. Cigarette companies advertise heavily in
campus publications, emphasizing testimonials by leading athletes and
other figures who appeal to youth. They even hire campus representa-
tives, college students who are paid to pass out free samples, give sales
talks, and help run contests among fellow students. Ads are designed
to " present a glamorous picture of smoking; none ever mentions the
risk involved. .
Aiding in the irresponsible promotion are radio, television and other
media which accept cigarette advertising without any of the restrictions
that they insist upon when they advertise liquor, druyLa, 'and other
ipotentially harmful items. Congress and state legislatures have con-
sistently avoided moves to set up controls. Colleges rarely limit cigarette
sales on campus. Parents "themaelves, though they often urge their
youngsters not to take up smoking, do so with lighted cigarettes in
their hands.
` Other governments, notably'those of Italy and Britain, have moved
to limit and control the promotion of cigarettes in their countries. With
some 4,500 American youngsters between the ages of 12 and 17 taking'
up the smoking habit every day, isn't it time that the United States
followed the example of these other countries in protecting their youth?

ological age of an individual human being
law: of the California State Denartment of
it is possible to make some statements anout Public Health, have pulblished a paper on
the physiological age of populations. the relationship of amount of cigaremte
smokinQ tb mronarv heart diseatv rmrtalitv
," An Englistanan namen t,ompercz a&gt;ts- rates in men. They mention that there are
covered l.aist century that there is a plottable
i+elationship between the age-spercific death
,.rates (number of deaths per thousand
people of that age) of adults and the age.
x. Infants and children have a rather large
mortality, and the mortality reaches a min-
imum at about age 12. From age about 40
on, the age-specific mortality increases by
a definite factor, with a doubling time of
about 8.5 years.
Professor Harlin Joneb of the Donner
I.aboratory of the University of California
in Berkeley has made much use e8 Gompertz
~nves in his analysee of factors tlhat affect
~nortality: Gompertz curves can be plotted
for mortality from individual diseases.
For example, the Gompertz curves for
coronary heart disease show that the pmb-
ability that a cigarette smoker will die of
coronary heart dilsease at age 55 is the same
as the probability that a non-smoker will
die of coronary heart disesse at age 62
and is about twice the probalbility that a
cion-smoker will die oif coronary heart: di-
sease at age 55. With respect to this disease,
the cigarette smoker behaves as though his
physiological age were seven years greater
than his chronological age.
t
Corresponds To 8 Years
Professor Jones has reported that for all
di,&gt;eases the increased mortality of one-
pack-per day cigarette smokers corresponds
to an increase in physiologica9'age of eigInt
years, and that of two-pack-per-day
' smokers to 16 years, relative to non-
smokers.
There has been much talk about the in-
creased incidence of lung cancer for cigar-
ette smokers. It has been reporb ld that the
Incidence of lung cancer for two•packs-per-
day amokers liying in the city is 300 times
that for non-sfnokers living in the country.
There is a difference in the Gompertz curves
for city dwellers and country dwellers, cnr-
responding to a five-year decrease in life
expectancy for city dwellers, relative to
country dwel]ens, and part of the decrease
in life expectancy may be attributed to an
0
four times as many excess deaths associated
with cigarette smoking from coronary heart
disease as f2om lung cancer. Analysis of the Gompertz curves for pop-
ulations in different countries shows some
interesting differences. The mortality in
the United States is such *as to correspond
to a mean life expectancy of about 70 years,
Decrease Of 35 Years
In other countries the life expectancy is
somewhat greater, by three or four years-
countries such as Norway, Sweden, Den-
mark, Holland, and England. It is possible
that this difference is the result of a differ-
ence in the medical treatment available on
the average to people in the United States
and in these countries.
There are other countries, to be sure, In
which the mean life expectancy is less than
in the United States; for exs¢ixple, in Nor4h-
ern Rhodesia it is only 28 years. But the
United States still holds the record, for one
population: the life expectancy of the Papa-
gas Indians in Arizona Is only 17 yeare.
At the present time cancer causes about
20 percent of deaths in the United States.
If cancer were to be eliminated the age-
specific mortality would drop to 80 percent
.of the present value, and the Gompertz
curve would be shifted vertically by minus
0.1, the logarithm of 0.8. Hence the mean
life expectancy of Americans would be in-
creased by 2 years and 10 months i.f com-
plete controL'over cancer were to be ob-
tained.
However, cancer is not the principal cause
of decrease in life expectancy for Aane^i-
eaae. A better effort towards lengthening
the average life of Americans could be made
by eliminating cigarette smoking.
In 1959 Americans smoked about one-half
pack per day for adult Americans. This
amount of smoking corresponds to a de-
crease in life expectancy of four years for
the average American. To eliminate ciga-
rette smoking would increase the health and
longevity of Americans by 50 percent more
than to obtain oom,plete control of oancer.
It may tur out, of course, that it is easier
to control ctancer than to control cigsrette
smoking. Neverthless, ft is possible to stop.
Between 1954 and 1959 a marked change
occurred in the smoking habits of physicians.
In Massachusetts; the number of cigarotte
smokers decreased from 52 percent in 1954
to 39 percent in 1959, with a still greater
fractional decrease in the nnurnber smoking
more than one pack a day.
If both cancer and cigarettes were to be '
controlled, the life expectancy of Americans
would be increased by 6.S years.
The preicess of smoking a cigarette fn-
volves a decrease in life exipectancy for the
smoker which is three ti¢tiea the' tinm re-
quired to smoke the cigarette. Smoking cig-
arettes is three times as dangerous as trav-
eling in a jet plane. If you fly in an airplane
and don't smoke cigarettes you are three
tfmes as safe as if you stay at home and
smoke cigarettes.
I think that this a very Interesting axn-
parison, which all people-aUynt.tng people
especia]ly--ought to know: for whatever
length of tiane they devote to +anokin¢ cig-
arettes they are losing three times that
much time from their life. • From our discussion so far, we might reach
the conclusion that at' the present time mg-
arette smoking is the principal cause of de-
crease in life expectancy of Americans. In-
stead, It is the existence of stockpiles o~ nv-
clear weapons in the world that. ifs the prin-
cipal cause of decrease of life expetctancy of
Americans.
We may estimate that if there were to be
a nuclear war, during the first day unpro-
tected people in the Uni,ted States would
receive on an average 40 times he amount
of radiation needed to cause dea by acute .
radiation sickness. Entirely aside from the
blast, fire and immediate radiation effects,
local radioactive fallout from the bombs
used in such a great nuclear adt'aclt would
be expected to cause the death of most of
the American people, and an average de-
crease in life expectancy of, about 35 years
per person.
This quantity, 35 years, musit be multi-
plied' by the probability that there will be
a nuclear war. In the absence of reiiable
information about this probability, I rmght,
as the simplest hypothesis, equate it to the
probability that there will not be a nuclear
war, and thus evaluate it as one half. Ac-
cordingly, the decrease In life expectancy
for Americans resulting from the: existence
of nuclear stockpiles in the world Is calcu-
lated to be approximately 17.5 years, and
thus to be larger than the decrease attrib-
utable to any other cause.

Students on Li Waging Own Fight Against Smoking

A total -of 50,000 teenagers have been reached by,
the antismoking program, which is conducted by students
in, the individual schools. Programs of varyin scope have
tieen introduced into almost every junior an(.~ senior high

One of the results of thTs effort, accordingg to Dr,
~~ph Camardella of Malverne, president of the Nassau
~ivrsion, is that the society has learned it me.st catch
many students in their preteens if it wants to get the :
message across before they start smoking. The 'progra,m,
Camardella said, is now being expanded to in~lude the
tqp grades in elementary sc'hoois.
One example of how the program works is#hecam.paign,
now being conducted by the students of the Southwood
Junior High School in Syosset, where the student council
decided to conduct the campaign - after meeting with
the cancer society.
Frances Friedman, 13, an eighth grader of 23 Chelsea
Dr., Syosset, is chairman of the antismokin&amp; campaign.
With the assistance of Howard Pierson, pnncipal; An-
drew Baltz, assistant principal, and Mrs. Doris Robertson,
sphqol nurse, she worked out a program . involving just
about every department in the school.

This was tive of University of F7din-

Physicians' report on smoking and health
` influenced them. This report, issued slight-

- and heavy cigaret smoking was proved
beyond all reasonabi•'^ doubt.

Physicians' report on smoking and health
` influenced them. This report, issued slight-

beyond all reasonabi•'^ doubt.
The RCP report successhilly, persuaded

The other study, by Drs. Aarne Kont-

.•WAN DIEGO, Calif. (UPI?-The
president-e'-ec+ of the American
Med Cal Assbciation Thursday at=
tacked the King-Andersonl medi-
care bill and cigarette smoking in
a series of speeches ia- the San
Diego area.
Dr. Edward R. Annis called the
"King-Anderson bill a political ma•
neuver which "is not designed to
protect those over'65 from catas-
trophic medical expense."
The AMA president-elect fa.
vored the Kerr-Mills act, now op•
erating in 39 states, over the King-
Anderson legislation.
Annis termed the King-Anderson
bill "Fedicare" and said, "There
are some who would misuse the
health of the American people in
order to delude them, m i s l e a d
them, distort the story and not tell'
the truth to get votes."
TIMES
Seattle, Washington
March 1, 1963
He said the working man could
be paying for the care of the rich
under the King-Anderson bill while
the Kerr-Mills act was financed
by income taxes-based on the
ability to pay. :
The bill did not provide for 75
to 80 per cent' of the health care
needs of many senior citizens de-
tpite its estimated cost of $48 bil-
lton a year, Annis said.
Turning to cigarettes, Annis said'
that smoking is the greatest cause
of lung cancer. He said cigarettes
also contribute to and hasten the
advance of many other diseases.
,Il have or vut nave we
ttisease. It's just that' those sus-
•ceptible to lung cancer may get
tlie diseaae from smoking." . ;~
Among the many mysteries of
lung cancer, he mentioned, Is that
eight to nine times as many men .
have it as women. ••'We doq't
know why. Speculation is that it
may be linked to heredity or the
difference in hormone structures." Dr. Raleigh said cancer in. tbe~
lining of the lungs rarely -1,
ever-is found in non-smokers.
Cancer in lung glands, on the
other hand, is not related to
smoking, he added.

Casesf Long Sur.Wey Snovvs :
.Cigarettes and coffee are contributing factors to heart
failure, especially in the middleage group of males, a five-
year- survey at the Hawthorne Works Western Electric
Company, in Cicero„has indicated.
Dr. OglesbyPaul{ nationally-known•authority on coro-a

"Ifit proves nothingg else,, the'
survey indicates that: men in in-

The survey' to which Dr. Paul
tvasreferring iss a check.on more
than 2,000~ Western Electric em-

1957:.IiS original purpose wass to'
establish the effect of "middle

five years the researching phy-
sicians have delved into cardiac
problems. •. • . . .. During the five-year survey, I
the investigators-s o.m e t i me s
numbering 25 doctors - have
found'a high incidence of heart
disease in test groups composed
of heavy cigarette smokers and
persons drinking more than five
cups of coffee each day.
Tha survey also gava cigar and
pipe smokersa"claan, bill of

dded'that menwith high eholes-
t.rol~(fat) diets wera alsoprone

manager at Western Electric,
stated later that "preliminary
conclusions should not be ac-
cepted, because there are too
'many factors which can result in
heart disease."' . -
According to Joseph Levihson~
assistant to, Benedix, physicians
conducting the extended survey
foundnorelationshipbetweee
heart disease and occupational
skills. .
It was also noted, Benedix said,
that only cigarette smoking was
establlthed as a possible con-
tributory factor to heart ailments.
Thus, he eliminated' cigars and
pipes.
. . .
"COHCLUSIONS based on the
survey should not be misunder-
stood," Dr. Paul stated. "Our
findings„ as conclusive ass they
may seem~, do not apply to all
'
men."
He added that: the survey ap-
parently eliminated any relation-
ship between coronary diseases at
the type of work an employee was
I erforming.
Dn Paul also stated that the
j-
awthorne Plant had nothing to
o with the survey other than to
ffer its personnel and facilities~
to the survey staff.
.
"All Hawthorne employees get'
a rigid physical examination when .
they are employedi" Benedix
stated. "In addition, all depart-
ment chiefs are required to have
yearly check-ups.~ This procedure
made Western Electric personnel
ideal for the type of surveyDr.,
Paul had in mind." . : .1

comes from the consideration
that mainstream smoke is

Dangerous Proposition
Crossing Street's Also
Researcher Points Ou
' Smoke a cigarette and you've jiist .taken~ a
chance of getting lung cancer. Cross a busy
intersection and you've just taken a chance on
getting run over.
. Smoke two cigarettes and you've taken two
Ichances of getting lung cancer and cross the
intersection twice and you have doubled your
chances of getting run over.
"So what do you do about it?" A pipe-smoking
cancer specialist poised the question Wednesday
in Williamsburg. "Do you give up both smoking
and crossing streets?"
Baylor Upiversity's Dr. John T. Mallams evad-
ed his own question between puffs on his battered
briar. "Do what you think is best. First learn
the facts and use your own judgment."
In an interview prior to his speech to the
Middle Peninsula Academy of Medicine last night
at the James River Country Club, where hee
described one of the major advances he and his
Baylor collegues have just recently made in the
struggle in curing caneer,:..the 39•year-old doctor,
-said, no scientists have yet been able to produce
a cancer in a lung, human or animal, by means
of tobacco smoke.
YET, HE SAID, it has been known for years
that tobacco itself does produce cancer.
'And he added, statistically it has been welll
cstablished that' the incidence of lung cancer
is higher among smokers who inhale and that
incidence rates increase with volume of tobacco
fismoke inhaled.
= "So judge for yourself. "
: And he added, "Actually tobacco smoking
lioesn't cause as much•cancer as it does heart
'Jiseases "
The Pennsyl vania born doctor, father of three
Aildren, put down his pipe and said suddenly,
*You know, statistically I've got more of a
r2hance of getting cancer in the mouth by smok-
Ing this pipe than I would if I smoked a cigar-
ette,-but then mouth cancer is a devil of a lot
easier to cure."
For the past seven years, the• doctor said,
Baylor University has been trying to induce
lung cancer in rabbits by means of cigarette
smoke. So far they haven't succeeded.
"Of course we've got a lot of rabbits now.
that really get angry when we switch cigarette
brands on them-I'm serious-but despite our
lack of success this only proves you can't start
"No laboratories are needed to prove the tobacco
causes cancers. You just glance at their lips."
In simplifying the relationship between cancer
and smoking the Baylor radiotherapist explainedt
cells that' make up the body tissue are constantl.y•.
dying to be replaced by new cells. This process
is continue and natural. But it can be speeded
'up by a stimulant. •
"Smoke in the lungs is just that. It' speeds :
'.
up the process.
Now everytime the birth-death cycle happens
in a cell, there is that chance something could.
go wrong. If the cycle, is speeded up by an out-
side force, not only could something go wrong
because the cycle timing is unnatural, but the
'increase in number of cycles in that cell meanss
there is an increase of chances something could
go wrong.
. Dr. Mallams is one of the Baylor team of
scientists who three years ago came up with a
combination of a simple pressure pump, weighing
one pound, and a solution made up mostly of
hydrogen peroxide, and created a process. noww
hailed in leading. medical circles as a major
breakthrough in the cure of cancer.
THE DOCTOR is quick to point out the process
is "still very much in an eYperimental stage"
hut it has worked and is now being used nation-
ally.
The process is not a cure in itself, the doctor
pointed out, ar.d "above all it.is not a do-it-your-
self kit."
Simply, the process makes many cancers less
resistant to radium treatments by hitting the
cancer itself with an increase of oxygen.
"It is like a guy being taken down 64 feet in
the sea. The oxygen pressure is increased and
this increase has made many types of cancers
-some that before were incurable in as much
as.they didn't react to radium treatments-more
easily treated."
A cancer patient (75 per cent of them at,
Baylor are out patients( gets a tube pushed into
-an artery which is in the area of cancer, gets
some hydrogen peroxide (which is nothing but
oxygen in water) pumped through and then is shot
with X-rays.
"In many cases we have failed, in many cases
we have succeeded."
At the slide•illustrat:ed lecture last night, the
doctor warned his audience against over-optimism
about the process, terming it "a therapy which
a lung cancer with smoke in a nabbit." . can now be considered a treatment' for cancer,

Despite mounting evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship be-

This terrifying statistic from an American Public Health Association

lung cancer before they reach the age of 70.
" In 1961 alone, only six major cigarette companies spent more than
141 million dollars promoting their products. Much of this promotion is
directed at young people. Cigarette companies advertise heavily in
campus publications, emphasizing testimonials by leading athletes and
other figures who appeal to youth. They even hire campus representa-

talks, and help run contests among fellow students. Ads are designed
to " present a glamorous picture of smoking; none ever mentions the
risk involved. .
Aiding in the irresponsible promotion are radio, television and other
media which accept cigarette advertising without any of the restrictions
that they insist upon when they advertise liquor, druyLa, 'and other
ipotentially harmful items. Congress and state legislatures have con-

sales on campus. Parents "themaelves, though they often urge their

to limit and control the promotion of cigarettes in their countries. With

tles who feet the practice to be
detrimental to health and otbery
•vho feel that liaking cigarette
Armoking to hwg cancer and
dher diseases cannot be sup-
: ported by scientific evidence.
In this series of articles, The
Register presents arguments
supporting the claims that ci'-
garette smoking can be.linked
to many diseases of the respira-
tory and circulatory systems -
and how these arguments are
being acted upon.)
Cigarette smoking and Its he-'
ing linked to many diseases in-'
duding lung cancer is draw-
iag more fire in Orange County
than it would take to light the
estimated 500-billion-plus cigar-
ettes used each year in the U.S.
In rapid order here in the
past month the following anti-
cigarette statements and ac•
tions were taken:
1. An Orarge County physi-
cian delivered a two and one-
half page blast against cigar-
ette smoking in the pages of
the Bulletin of the Orange
County Medical Assn. .
2. A second' physiciar, long
associated with cancer research,
leveled the charge that cigar-
ette smoking is not "habit
forming" but rather addictive.
He stated further that cigar-
ette addicted p e r s o n a go
through the same withdrawal
pangs and pains as those an
hard narcotics-and most smok-
ers can't keep away from their
cigarette no matter how hard
they may try.
3. A news release from the
county chapter of the.. Natibpal
Uberculo4is Assn. reports '%t
British doctors of the Royal
College of Physicians of Lon-
don state point-blank, "Ctgar-
ette smoking is a cause of lung
cancer ard bronchitis; may con-
tribute to development of cor-
onary heart disease and some
other diseases, and delays heal-
ing of stomach ulcers."
4: Backing up the addiction
theory held ^.by the Orange
chapter of : trhe American Car.e
cer Societv released a small
booWt whiih asks-and an-
gw64W.the question "Why Can't
I Give Up Smoking?"
5. Finall,y,. another doctor
teamed' with a clergyman to
present a week - long program
in the Santa Ana Public Lt-
brary in an attempt to help
smokers help themselves.to stop
smoking in a plan similar to
Aleoholic.s Anonymous.
In addition to these develop-
ments in the ar.ti-smoking pic-
ture at the county level sev-
eral other steps have been tak-
en across the nation and
thro&lt;lghout the world. Included
in these actions which are at-
tempts to make the public 're- .
alize that there is danger con-
nected with cigarettes are the
following:
L On Sept. 17, 1962 the Un-'
lted States Air Force Surgeon
General's office notified all ma-
jor air commands, health agen-
cies and tobacco companies
that the practice of giving free
cigarettes to Air Force Hospi-
tal patients must be discontin.
ued.
The deputy surgeon general,
R. L. Bohannon, explained that
the "ever increasing evidence"
of a relationship between cigar-
ette smoking and cancer and
certain other diseases "no long-
er can be ignored."
2. The drugs committee of
the American Medical Assn.
was ordered to undertake a
was ordered to undertake a
study of the charges being
made but stopped when Sur-
geon Gen. Luther B. Terry said
the U.S. Public Health Service
would conduct a similar study
in hopes of finding a"once
and for all" answer to the
medical and health problems
involved. The AMA said it
would cooperate with the Pub-
lic Health Service study and
turn over material it had al-
ready garnered.
3. Internationally, the Italian
government banned all cigar-
ette advertising on billboards,
newspapers, radio and television
while the Danish government
was asked to' prohibit pubiic
smoking by all persons under
the age of 16 and to curtail cigi
arette advertising.
14n England another adwer
was supplied by increasing the
tax on 'cigarettes with the ex•
press idea that raising the
cost of smoking to prohibitive
limits might' do what educa-
tioral programs had failed to
do over the years.
.
Back on the Orange County
scene it is recalled that The
Register conducted an Informal
survey among the 833 members
of the county medical associ-
tion. The survey showed that
93 per cent of the doctors re-
plying stated they link cigar.
ette smokir_(, to lung cancers
as a probable causitive factor.

Critic at Large
,
Herbert , Hoover's 'Fishing for Fun' ' ~
~
anmenmuUausmawmmmnsanr By BROOKS ATKINSON
emiximininnmuoann~muw~
.Inspires Thoughts on Pipe-Smoking
'T~&gt;~l~~ings over
y-which is
the best way of thinking -
Herbert Hoover has just fin-
ished a little book about
fishing.
"PYshing for Fun" he calls
it. On the jacket Justice
William O. Douglas gives it
the United States Supreme
Court's seai, of approvai, and
Random House has published
it. Mr. Hoover's book contains
a number of understatements.
Commenting on the talent the
bonefish has for being absent
when a fisherman• is present,
Mr. Hoover characteristically
takes the high-minded view:
"This is good training for re-
. - strained thinking," he says
quietly. Or again: "Lots of
people committed crimes dur-
ing the year who would not
have done so if they had been
fishing.-. _
Whi3e reading Mr. Hoover's
handbook on fishing, I real-
ized that he is well qualified
y by temperament' and experi-
ence to write a companion
handbook on pipe-smoking.
Many of his observations
would be interchangeable, for
the moral therapy is the
same. The jackeG of his book
includes a photograph of our
glst President lighting a pipe
with a kitchen match and de-
filing the atmosphere of his
Waldorf Towers apartment
with tobacco smoke. The de-
gree of concentration re-
corded in the photograph is
remarkable. -
Although Mr. Hoover's rec-
ord of public service since the
Belgium relief program in
1914 Is well known to every-
body, liis put,ic. service to
pipe-srr.oking is less cele-
brated. Years ago when he
and Sam Gompers were smok-
ing together, some prig com-
plained that they smoked too
much. Gompers retorted that
although he had started
smoking when he was 7 he
had not' smoked too much yet.
He also regretted that his
father had wasted a lot of
time by not beginning until
he was 9.
Mr. Hoover, now 88, does
not feel that he has smoked
too much yet. When he was
immobilized in the Columbia-
Presbyterian Medical Center
last autumn, he missed a few
days in the beginning, but he
resumed smoking as soon as
the worst was over. During the
entire term of his captivity,
about 30 doctors attended him
at one time or another. He
takes satisfaction in recalling
that none of them advised him
to stop smoking. _
The nurses confined to his
sickroom and some of the
other patients on his floor
might have wished that he
would stop. The fire depart-
ment might have dispatched a
posse of pumpers and smoke-
eaters if it had known. But
none of the medical staff saw ,
any inconsistency between a
pipe and a convalescent re-
turning to the amenities of
society.
Two women have made sig-
pificant contributions to Mr.
Hoover's pipe techniques. He
uses kitchen matches, which
have body and flame. They
light ardently, and they bura
long enough to get a pipeful
of tobacco lighted. But a
European maid who was once
in Mr. Hoover's employ was
appalled by the way he men-
aced the furniture when he
struck matches. She glued
sandpaper under the edges of
the tables within striking
range, thus making it possible
for him to strike at random
without ecarring the fur-
niture.
Mrs. H. V. Saltenborn pro-
vided the ultimate refinement.
She presented Mr. Hoover
with a rough-textured rock
in a wooden bowl. Now Mr.
Hoover can sit in his ac-
customed chair, strike a
match on the rock at his
elbow and toss the match into
the bowl without interrupting
the conversation. He is as
well off in his Towers apart-
ment as if he were fishing in
a mountain stream.
In "Fishing for Fun" Mr.
Hoover quotes another life-
long fly fisherman who occu-
pied the White House. Grover
Cleveland said that "by teach-
ing patience and generating
or stimulating useful con-
templation [the fishing habit]
tends directly to the increase
of the intellectual power of
itS votaries and through them
to the improvement of our
national character."
That would be the theme.
If Mr. Hoover regards fishing
as the sovereign remedy for
"all ~ moral, spiritual and phys-
ical ills," as he says in his
book, he is in the right mood
for a book about pipe-smok-
ing. There's a big ashtray on
his desk.

one of many factors being studied by scientists.
However, he said, "Much of the discussion of tobacco and health has been

This is unfortunate, but true. What you have been seeing is a flurry of headline-

"Theoriea about tobacco still rest chiefly cn statistical associa.tion studies,

He quoted from a recent article by Dr. Joseph Berksony head of medical statistics at
the Mayo Clinic, who said: Statisti'ca2istudies 'must be confirmed by experimental

The American Cancer Society has issued a six-
_page press release on a new booklet

titled "Cigarette Smoking and Lung Cancer." Beneath the cover title of the 32-page
booklet appears the sentence: "The evidence upon which the American Cancer Society's

•'',!;position and programs are based."



;~The A.C.S. press release says the booklet "answers point by point arguments of
`.tobacco industry spokesmen and a few scientists who question or refuse to accept

Ahe evidence linking cigarettes and lung cancer."
"The cause of cancer is unknown so how can one say that cigarette smoking
causes lung cancer?"
"The evidence is only statistical and therefore inconclusive."
"There may be a genetic factor which~causes a person to smoke and also
him~to develop lung cancer."
4. "The statistical evidence is not supported by animal experimentation."
5. "It is unreasonable to believe that cigarette smoking could cause lung cancer,


cancer of the bladder, coronary thrombosis, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, etc." Y=,~
6. "Not all cigarette smokers or even all heavy cigarette smokers develop cancer."
7. "There is increasing evidence that viruses may cause human cancer so how

could cigarette smoking also be a cause?" , . ,;.":
"Cigarette smoking cannot be the cause of lung cancer because other causes
have been demonstrated."



The booklet itself summarizes the A.C.S.'s policies and actions relating to
cigarette smoking and lung cancer and describes what is called clinical, epidemiological~~t

"3.,pathological, experimental and "related"'evidence supporting the claim that cigarette

; Times' staff writer John A. Osmundsen reports~that 4 American research institutions

.;have formed a task force to find the viruses that "scientists are becoming convinced
~~ cause cancer in e.mal.s." The research institutions involved are: The National Cancer
=,:Institute, the Sloan-Kettering Institute, the Roswell Park Memorial Institute
'and Baylor University College of Medicine.
1, .~ '.... . ., ... . . ~ . . ~ - .. ..~,. , ~ . . ~ ~ ~ .


The news story says the first project of the task force will be to search for human
viral counterparts to animal leukemia viruses and for relationships between two.
%.-'coannon viruses that cause respiratory disease in human beings. These viruses have
roduced malignancies in experimental animals, according to the news story. ~ e
;
`Osmundsen also-says a prominent virologist in a recent interview conceded "...the

;,possibility that cancer might turn out to be a virus disease, pure and simple, and
~that any virus at all might have the capacity for causing it."'


~Both The New York Times and the New York Daily News on Monday, April 8, carried
&gt;editorials commenting on the possible relation of viruses to cancer. The Times
=,:editorial says "But if that proof can be found (i.e., viruses cause cancer and
the mechanism behind such a series of events understood, tremendous progress will


;-have been made toward dealing with this scourge."
The Daily News editorial comments on the possibility that viruses may be found to

:;cause cancer as follows:

-:."If it should happen, the cigarets-cause-cancer people's faces would be very red,

and they would have a lot of explaining to do to the well-meaning persons now
•financing the anti-cigaret attacks on the tobacco farmers, the tobacco industry,
and one of the favorite pastimes of tens of millions of Americans.
:"Incidentally, there is no laboratory proof that cigarets ever gave cancer to a
human being; and most cigaret smokers never get lung cancer.


"Why not halt this whole anti-cigaret fight until all the evidence is in, one way

or the other?"

Editor's Note: The annual Science Writers Seminar of the American Cancer Society
opened Friday, April 5, and will continue through Wednesday, April 10, at La Jolla, Cal.)
Herald Tribune science writer Earl Ubell in this story reports on a paper given at
La Jolla by Dr. Seymour Cohen. Dr. Cohen's research deals with the mechanism by
whichcertain viruses destroy sewage bacteria and was presented as offering clues
to the relationship between viruses and cancer.
An Associated Press story,originating from La Jolla Monday morning, April 8, says
"Smoke, the bane of cities, and cigarette smoking, the pleasure of millions,.play
havoc with human lung cells growing in test tubes, a scientist finds." It describes
a research report before the science writers meeting by Dr. Charles M. Pomerat of
- Pasadena, California. He is quoted as saying that lung cells exposed to cigarette
- smoke show far more breaks in their chromosomes, the carriers of heredity, than
cells not exposed to smoke. The AP story observes "Many agents that break chromosomes,
like x-rays or chemicals, are known to produce cancers."

ON THE TRAIL OF CANCER-The search forr
causes of cancer leads on to the mystery of
life titself. Earl Ubell traces the known to the un-

Torturing questions often assail the cancer victim as he
lies in the hospital bed harboring In his body a living,
throbbing ball of carelessly growing flesh: Why me? Bbr
my sins? • Because I'm unluckp? Because I come from a
weak family? Did I catch it somewhere?
This 'self-doubt, ebbing and rising as the disease does,
has a special poignancy when added to pain. In many cases,
scientists can tell the patient what caused the cancer. Most
of the time, they cannot. Contrary to popular opinion,
some causes of cancer are known.
Scientists today know that' strange Industrial chemicals
can fire up cancers in the bladder and the lungs. They have
proved that X-rays and other radiation can ignite lawless
growth In almost any part of the body. They have piled up
numbers. that strongly implicate cigarette, smoke ar air
nolhttibn. They have generated In an4mala virus Infections
that culminate ip eancer. All are causes of cancer. .
But the ultimate cause of eancer-if there is such a
lhing--still hides from science. The problem has emerged
as one of the great Litellectual riddles of the 20th century,
. rivaled only by and closely bound fio the puzzle of what is
life itself.
. Beyond merely satisfying man's ctuiosity. discovering
OSe trigger of cancer has great pract'ieal irnpor't'ance. By
knowing the conditions that produce the disease. science
sad societT can move to eliminate or ooatrol !t, Knowledge
of oause may also bring cure. although not necessarily. We
know what causes measles; we cannot ciae it, but with a
vaccine we may soon wipe It out.
Even at this early moment in cancer'research, with the
deep cause of cancer stllll a mystery, scientists have moved
to knock out eancers for which they know causes. they have
removed Industrial chemicals that provoke cancers In
workers. They have limited the use of X-rays to medically
essentiall maneuvers. They have started a campaign against
eigarette smoking.

Only L~- the last year have biochemists unraveled part
of the meanin$ of this chemical cryptogram. Briefly stated,
the artarigement of the atoms in the long chains of nucleic
icads dEtermines which enzymes the cell chemistry will
construct. 'i7neee enzymes are like the men In the bucket
brigade. Huge molecules of thousands of atoms each, they
,bring amall molecules together to make big ones and they
break big molecules- Into little ones. Each chemical re-
action In the cell has a different enzyme.
The eompleidty of the instructtons is almost beyond
belief because they not only specify what enzymes must be
made, but their sequence, their amount, their responses to
outside chemicals, their rates of accumulation and so on.
In turn, the amount and type of enzymes determine what
sort of cell the cell will be; what sort of organ the cells
will make and whait sort of human being the organs will
create: slI this encoded on a strip of nucleic acid visible
onl1 under the electron mieroscope.
The story gets even more incredible when one realizes
that the original Instructions are contained in the sperm
and egg that Join to make the first cell. And the first cell
divides again and again, reproducing the instructions
P+eperh modified for each of its 50 trillion daughters.

tied out extensive studies on the relation of
smoking to deaths from cancer and other dis-
sases, has issued a new booklet giving answers
to eight queations "most frequently raised by
spokesmen for the tobacco induatry and a'few
adentiats.'' Spokesmen for the tobacco industry,
however, challenge the society's findings. George
V. Allen, President of the Tobacco Institute,
charges that the authors of the booklet "have
selected those facts, theories and opinions that
support their own views, ,' while "they have
omitted or oversimplified other facts, theories
and opinions that do not support their views."
Careful reading of the presentations of both
sides indicates that the Cancer Society has made
the stronger case. The booklet points out that,
in addition to the extensive study by the Cancer
Society carried out from 1952 to 1958, more than
25 scientific studies in 10 countries have showa
"that there is a hig(t degree of relationship
between cigarette smoking and lung cancer,"
'what is even more significant, "that the
f developing lung cancer is directly related
toZhe number of cigarettes smoked."
''Against such flat statements the industry
offers the purely negative argument "that the
evidence is only statistical and therefore ineon-
t'_;~_~; elusive" and that there are causes other than
smoking known to produce caneer., In the
absence of more positive evidence, there is at
least a strong possibility that cigarette smoking

- But the Tobacco Institute makes a valid point
when it reminaa^ the public that a committee of
aclentasti appointed by the Surgeon General or

to complete "a comprehensive review of all avail-

They demonstrate that a similar
bias could be introduced into a study
of their own, in which selection of
`
'
age groups and mortality ratios
_
among industrial workers produces an
apparent job health risk which actu-
ally may not exist
"It is interesting,to note," they add,
"that this hazard could be claimed to
affect death from lung cancer or from
circulatory causes depending on one's
reliance on mortality ratios or on dif-
ferences in death probabilities. The
congruence between the projected
findings of this imaginary study to
those of the lung cancer and smoking
studies is noteworthy; especially if
one keeps in mind that most popula-
tions of smokers so investigated were
. concentrated in the older age groups."
', They call for re-evaluation of pres-
ent statistical methods in the field of
chronic disease epidemiology before
conclusions about the causes of such
diseases are reached.
"While comparisons between smok-
ers and non.smokers are always con-
troversial," they say, "there too are
populations who may differ in many
other ways besides addiction to a
single habit and accordingly may vary
widely in mortality and morbidity
patterns during their life spans. The
extent of these differences and their
force on mortality in middle and older
ages have not been truly explored."
Their own study involved a group
of 4,573 white workers in a heavy in-
dustry, residing in seven states, from
1940 to 1957. For the.entire group
(ages 25 to 85), they point out, deaths
Erom lung cancer, other cancer and
coronary diseases occurred about as
frequently as in the U1S. population
as a whole.
1 If, however, the workers being stud-
ied are limited to those aged 65 and
up, the death rates for cancer and
coronary diseases appear to increase
markedly. An investigator who adopts
this age limitation "apparently dis-
cov,ers an industrial hazard where in
actuality none may exist."
When the comparisons are limited
to those under the age of 65, there is
found a "favorable balance of sur-
vival" into older age groups that "can-
not be appreciated fully if large
segments of their life spans are omit-
ted." The result of this survival at
younger ages makes more of the group
eligible for "degenerative and neoplas-
tic disease" after the age of 65.
"Conclusions drawn from epidemi-
ological studies," the authors state,
"depend in the last analysis on the
methods selected to compute the risk
of reaction and death from specific
causes. In most investigations of
chronic diseases the data cover only
limited segments of the life span and
are restricted to a relative small num-
ber of diseases from which members
of the cohort may die. ... The prior
unknown mortality experience in con-
trasted populations or differing, con-
current mortality from diseases other
than the one under study may lead to
apparent differences in age-specific
rates when in fact the 'net' risks are
essentially identical."

of those whose smoking habits were
unknown or unclassified. The number
of men in each category ranged from
70 (pipe and cigar smokers) up to
288 (moderate smokers).
The researchers said that incidence
figures in the categories did not "vary
significantly," adding that "This find-
ing is in direct contradiction to clinical
findings and suggests that myocardial
infarcts may be more productive of
severe symptoms, and thus more eas-
ily recognized, in heavy smokers than
in non-smokers."
The doctors also graded aortic spec-
imens, making allowance for the sub-
jects' chronological ages. They found
that the degree of aortic sclerosis was
directly proportional to age in 60~Jo
of their subjects, regardless of smok-
ing habits. In the other 40afo, however,
they found that premature sclerotic
changes were more than twice as com-
mon among heavy and moderate smok-
ers than in non-smokers and users of
pipes and cigars.
The researchers concluded, "The
incidence of myocardial infarction is
only very slightly higher in heavy
smokers of cigarettes than in non-
smokers, and there is no consistent
rise in the incidence of such lesions
with degree of cigarette smoking. The
incidence of other types of lesions re-
lated to arteriosclerosis is not affected
by smoking habits."

In the patient with tuberculosis, the

vise.* ,. ~
This warning emerges from a study
of 34 patients found to have both
diseases. This experience, the surgeons
say, supports the theo 'ry that lung scar-
ring may be one cause of primary lung
cancer.
Of their patients, 31 had both le-
sions in the same lung. Delay in diag-
nosis of the neoplasms averaged 13
months, they found, and most often
was attributable to the attending phy-
sician. . . . . .
TB Came First in 19
The patients were seen at the Mis-
sissippi State Sanatorium between
1951 and 1960. Nineteen developed
pulmonary tuberculosis at least three
years before the onset of malignancy,
which usually arose in the old tuber-
culosis lesions. In the remaining 15
patients, tuberculosis and lung cancer
apparently arose simultaneously, the
surgeons state. • • ,
` Our experience and review of the
literature," they report, "while not
conclusive, supports the concept that
persistent epithelial regenerative ef-
forts in areas of scarring, from tuber-
culosis or other chronic pulmonary
disease may be an etiologic factor in
carcinoma." -

. and a virus to spawn malignant
tumors.
That certain viruses can cause
' cancer in laboratory animals is
;: firmly established, but no one yet
has uncovered a human cancer
; virus. The very nature of the vi-
rus rus makes it a likely candidate
. '' for breeding cancer.
From all that has been deter-
mined mined about these ultra-minute
organisms, it appears that a virus
is not' quite living and not quite
non-living. It seems to be a blob
of nucleic acid-the heredity mole-
cule and the stuff of genes-sur-
rounded by a protein skin. Some
microbiologists liken viruses to
: free genes without a cell.
When a certain virus comes in
contact with a certain living cell
for which is has an ' affinity, it
squirts its nucleic acid into the
cell. Once injected, the virus
"genes" make their way to the
cell nucleus and apparently insert
themselves into the cell's chromoa
somes, or string of genes.
The insertion of these "wild"
genes upsets the whole function
of the cell. In established virus
diseases, such as polio, the virus
causes the cell to stop its normal
operation and turn to the produc-
tion of more viruSPs. In the
process the cell Is dest'royed!
But if viruses are responsible
for cancer, a different process is
employed. Instead of causing the
cell to destroy itself, the virus
causes it' to burst' into rapid, ma-
lignant reproduction.
The viral theory of cancer ::^as
formed by Dr. Wendell M. Stan-
ley Nobel prize winning virologist,
in 1956. At that time the idea
seemed revolutionary, but' since
then there has been much experi-
mental evidence to support such
a theory an&amp; nothing to disprove
it-
Virus Necessary?
It is the fervent' hope of many
in the field that virus is necessary
to cancer,, for then there is a
possibility that it can be knocked
out once and for all-destroyed by
drugs or neutralized by vaccines.
Just how firm this possibility
might be is open to speculation.
Not all virust caused diseases can
as yet be prevented by vaccines.
Besides, to date, only. one virus
disease has ever been cured by a
drug and this under rather unique
circumstances.
A sidelight of the cancer-virus
research has been development
of the idea that certain cancers
may be due to an undeveloped or
suppressed bodily defense mech-
anism.
Carcinogenic chemicals, radia-
tion or a weakness developed be-
fore birth may lead to a poorly
functioning system, which in turn
fails to detect or fails to react
against cancer viruses and so per-
mits them to establish their chain
of malignancy.
This theory was evolved in part
from studies of virus-caused leu-
kemia, or cancer of the blood-
forming tissues, in laboratory ani-
mals.
But whether viruses are at the
bottom of all cancer or not, the
fact remains that exposure to cer-
tain carcinogens tend to produce
cancer.
This was probably first made
clear by the early chimney sweeps
of London who were inclined to de-
velop cancer on areas exposed to
soot.
All of us are exposed to some
carcinogens. Sunlight, for in-
stance, has been shown to induce
skin cancer, yet fife is impossible
without sunlight. Radiation strikes
at us not only from fallout butt
from the earth, from outer space
and a hundred other- natural and
man-made sources.
In addition, some occupations
by their nature expose workers to
specific carcinogens. Radiologists,
for instance, used to expose them-
selves unwittingly to a cancer haz-
ard from the very tools they were
helping to develop to fight cancer.
Cancer Causes
Certain metallic dusts, aromatic
amine dyes, specific fractions of
petroleum and many other chemi-
cals and compounds used irr in-
dustry and certain occupations
have been proven dangerous be-
cause of their connection with
cancer.

The search for carcinogens has ""'"'
been drawn out because in man it
usually takes so long for cancer
to develop, even under daily con-
tact with a potential cancer stimu-
lator.

The possibility that air pollution
and smoking may produce lung
cancer was not demonstrable
until involved statistics covering
a period of three decades or more
had been sorted out and evalu-
ated. . .,
Then too, while something like
radiation-induced c a n ce r may
show up in a laboratory animal in
a period of weeks or months, a
man exposed to a proportionate
amount of radiation may not de-
velop a cancer tumor for several
decades. By then the exposure
which caused it might' be forgot-
ten.
At any rate, whether caused by
chemical or virus, fallout or sun-
light, or a combination of factors,
medical science is closing in on
cancer.
It may be that some cancer re.
search sounds more like shooting
in the dark than enlightened ex-
perimentation. But there is noth-
ing hit=or-miss about' the cumula-
tive results of such work. In fact,
some physicians think that these
patient men have already start-
ed giving us the "cure." It de•
pends upon your point of refer-
ence.
Irradiation, certain drugs, and
surgery have prevented death
from cancer among thousands and'
enabled them to live until death
caught up from other causes- in-
cluding old age.
In a sense, this is a cure-a
cure for some cases of some form
of cancer. Every year more peo-
ple are surviving cancer, a good
indication that our techniques and
treatment are progressing. Carry
this progression far enough, and
cancer will no longer remain a
major health problem.
In other words, the final "cure"
is already underway. But it is
coming about throu&amp; a slow
series of steps rather than by
means of a dramatic break-
through.

Should the government take some kind of ac- ' ' ~', years has campalgne(I vigorously against cig-

tion to discourage smoking of cigarets? This is
one of the major.questions before the Surgeon

Health, which has just embarked on a study of
all available scientific data on the effects of
: smoking on human health, ~ 1:
Killed in the Nebraska Legislature Tuesday
was' a bill which would-require that cigarets

s~ "sold in the state be labeled hazardous to human
-health. Reports were that the proposal had at=
tracted wide-spread attention. Nebraska also
receives a sizeable amount of revenue from the
sales tax that is now imposed on cigarets.
: At stake in the Public Health Service study is
the well-being of an $8 billion industry which
utilizes a major agricultural product and yields
$3 billion a year in federal and state tax reve•
nues. I At stake also is the peace of mind of 65
million habitual smokers In the United States
who seem unable or unwilling to give up cigr
aret smoking despite mounting evidence that it
-has something to do with the Incidence of lung
cancer,, other respiratory diseases and heart
trouble.
: After publication of a report on the question
:by Royal College of Physicians last March,
Great Britain imposed restrictions on cigaret
advertising and ordered removal of cigaret
vending machines from places where they would
.-be accessible to juveniles. In the United States
the only_ governmental action taken against
.,cigarets to date has been a ban on distribution
of free cigarets to patients in Air Force hos-
pitals rind a ban on inclusion of cigarets In
_;lunch boxes packed for Air Force personnel on
-long flights. Air Force Surgeon GeneraU Oliver

was now educating its people on "the relation-

.-The effect of smoking on health is still a
matter of scientific controversy, anh it is likely
to remain so until the origin of dread diseases

ight on Cigaret Smoking Controversy
-
t aret smoking, especially among. young people.
Mainstay of the cigaret's deferisii is the Scien-
'tific Advisory Board of the Tobacco Industry
Research Committee, established in 1954 when
-..cigaret sales dropped off temporarily in re-
sponse to a cancer scare.
-: The major evidence against the cigaret is sta-
.tistical. A number of studies made over the
past 15 years links high mortality, especially
from lung cancer, to cigaret smoking. A Public
Health Service study of 200,000 World War I
veterans showed the lung cancer mortality rate
to be 10 times higher for smokers than non-
smokers; the more heavily the individual
smoked, the more likely he was to be attacked

by this disease. The correlation applied solely
to cigaret smoking; the mortality rates for
cigar and pipe smokers were only sliglltly
higher than for non-smokers. Similar results
were shown by American Cancer Society studies.
' Some scientists have insisted, however, that
statistical correlations do not prove a cause-
and-effect relationship. They say that they
overlook other factors-previous infections, air
pollution,. heredity - which haye also been
shown to have a high correlation with lung
cancer mortality.
Tobacco smoking has been under attack on
grounds of health and morals ever since the
product was introduced to the civilized world
400 years ago. Kings, popes, muftis and a Rus,
sian czar condemned smoking in the 17th cen-
tury, But mankind took to tobacco and govern-
ments in time began to profit from taxing a
booming Industry. Nevertheless, anti-cigaret re-
formers in the United States -became influen-
tial enough in the late 19th~ and early 20thh
centuries to obtain legal bans on the sale of
cigarets in as many as 14 states at one time or
another.
The controversy today differs from that of
earlier times in that it is being fought out by
means of scientific research, although the argu•
ments are still often fraught with emotion and
prejudice. Considering man's firm attachment
to the smoking habit, it has been suggested
that research be directed to locating harmful
ingredients and eradicating them from cigarets.
Unfortunately, the very ingredients which are
Implicated are the ones which contribute most
to the satisfactions found in smoking.

en Britons Go to Australia ... ;: a
; .. .
Lung Cancer Risks Drop After Move
Men and women who emigrate to
Australia from Great Britain show
higher lung cancer mortality rates
than Australian-born men and women,
but lower lung cancer mortality rates
than are found in England and Wales.
The differences do not appear to be
due to differences in smoking habits,
according to Dr. Geoffrey Dean of
Eastern Cape Provincial Hospital,
Port Elizabeth, South Africa.'
Dr. Dean said his findings, similar
to those he previously had reported
for his home country, are "consistent
with the hypothesis that the contribu-
tion of air pollution to lung cancer has
been seriously underestimated."
Also, he wrote, the Australian data
were basically in line with those from
previous studies of British immigrants
to New Zealand and the United States.
He first compared' smoking habits
of British immigrants and native-born
Australians and found Australians
had smoked somewhat fewer cigarettes
per capita until World War I'I, buthad
caught up with and passed the British
in the 1950's.

The discrepancy does not appear to
be attributable to biases in the data,a
foreign birth, tuberculosis, or ciga-
rette smoking, according to Drs. C. D.
McClure, B. K. Milmore and A. G.
Gilliam. The finding, they say, "sup-
ports the idea that some factors as-
sociated with~ high risk of lung cancer
have not yet been identified."
From March 1953 to December
1958, a total of 1,946 residents of the
county at the time of the 1953 survey
•"Relative risk from lung cancer in Alle-
Rheny County,,Pa. (1953-1958)." Journal of
Chronlc D'ueoses, November 1962.

said, "Insofar as British immigrants
have adopted the smoking habits of
the country to which they have mi-
grated - and the evidence from South
Africa suggests this is the usual prac-
tice - British immigrants will have
become heavier smokers than the men
and women they have left behind
them."
'Yet, during the years 1950 to 1958,
British-born men migrating to Aus-
tralia had a lung cancer mortality
rate about 40% lower than the rate
for men of the same age in England ~
and Wales, and the corresponding
figpre for women was about 35ofo
' lower
In his Australian study, Dr. Dean
found that, ". .. during,the years from
1950 to 1958 (excluding 1952), male
British immigrants had a lung cancer
mortality rate that was 67a/o higher
than that of Australian-born men, but
39oJo lower than that of men in Eng-
land and Wales."
"During the same period," Dr.
Dean says, "female British immi-
grants had a lung cancer rate 33ofo
higher than Australian~born women,
but 347o lower tham women in Eng-
land and Wales."
In Lung Cancer,
were certified as having died of pri-
mary lung cancer. Of these, 892 were
identified as survey participants, and
the remaining 1,054 as non-partici-
pants. -.--
Smoking Influence Doubted
Compared to the national rates of
lung cancer deaths for each of the
years involved, the authors say, there
was an over-all deficiency of 71.8
deaths (-7.4 percent) among the
survey participants, and an over-all
excess of 344.5 deaths (+48.5 per-
cent) among the non-participants.
"In the absence of smoking histor-
ies from the non-participants," the
authors observe, "one cannot say
whether this factor could account for
their excess lung cancer but it would
appear unlikely that the smoking ques-
tion had much influence on whether
people were x-rayed or not."

recorded'as due to some other cause
of death.
If one wishes only to know the num-
ber of lung cancer cases, the actual -
does not vary "greatly" from the cases
recorded but, they add, "if one wishes
to correlate some variable such as cig-
arette smoking, with lung cancer, the
individual death records must be con-`
sidered. Here, the error is far greater.",,
' The death -records and histories
totalled 13,307. Of these, the investi- '
gators found, 269 gave primary lung
cancer as the cause of death. However,
they note, 49 of these patients never
had cancer of the lung, and' one more
was thought to be cured at the time i
of death{ an, error of 18,2 percent. _.,;'".,-:
In addition, cancer of the lung, un-
specified as to whether primary or
secondary, was said to have been the
cause of 695 deaths. In this group, it
was found that 126 never had primary
lung cancer, a discrepancy of 18.1
percent.

Other Errors Also Found


:` If the two groups are totalled, the
scientists point outy the combination
"constitutes a 20.4 percent overstate-
ment of primary cancer" of the lung.
Errors of varying size were also
found for other recorded sites of can-
cer death in their study.
"It is rather surprising," the inves-'
tigators say, "that so many physicians
report a cancer death according to the
site of the metastasis rather tham by
the primary site. .:. Errors of diag-
nosis have always occurred and will
continue unless universal accept-
ance of autopsies takes place. Several
papers have been published on the
accuracy of diagposis and there has
been speculation whether trends such
as are found in lung cancer are as
pronounced' as they appear to be.
Changes in the accuracy of diagnosis
could well alter the statistics."
The scientists conclude: "It is be-
lieved that the data from the Massa-
chusetts clinics are probably more ac-
curate than for the state as a whole
since the clinics specialize in malig-
nancy and have life-time follow-up
of all cases. A cross-section of all
Massachusetts cancer deaths may well
show greater error than the sample
from the clinics. It is believed that
they would never show less, and such
ratios as have been compiled may
be accepted as indicating minimum
errors."

Association at the Jack Tar Hotel in Durham, Mr. Allen said, "I am confident that
the scientific community which discovered the secrets of the atom and is now

exploring the outermost reaches of space will be able to solve these human health

problems."

The former Director of the U.S. Information Agency said that "research~on

smoking must continue, but so must research along all other possible avenues.
cannot afford'to ignore any clue. We must avoid the easy acceptance of a simple
answer no matter how often it is repeated."

Mr. Allemnoted that tobacco people have "a double interest" in this matter:
_ , :~
"First, as human beings, we are interested in the health of our fellow man.


"Second, we have a natural interest in the future welfare of our industry --


and of the industry's customers.
"We are vitally interested in~ getting the f ac.ts that will provide answers to
questions about smoking and health~. We also want full knowledge about the causes
of those diseases with which smoking has been statistically associated'.
"In a way, we have a crusade. It should be a crusade neither for nor against
tobacco. It is a crusade for research -- in the agricultural stations, the
scientific laboratories, and the great hospitals and medical centers of the nation."

Lord.Newton said he stood by the report of the Royal College of Physicians that

Smoking is neither "all good nor all bad," the author says. He hasn't stopped
smoking: "I am not convinced in my own mind that the direct relationship between
smoking and cancer has been proved."
,.Smoking may be potentially dangerous in lung cancer and heart disease, should be
banned in certain illnesses, but "we doctors don't have the right to set ourselves

ALLEN OUTLINES'SOME OF REASONS WHY

New York -- The President of The Tobacco Institute, Inc., said today that
ople sometimes forget that there are some good reasons why the theories about
smoking and health problems are in dispute, and are often questioned by responsible

George V. Allen, former Director of the U.S. Information Agency, the
Institute president, said that the "'original theory about smoking and lung cancer
-- the theory that smoke was a direct, contact carcinogen -- has virtually been

to be investigated.°'
"1. The case against smoking still rests largely on statistical studies,

whose meanings are questioned by many leading medical statisticians.

"2. Intensive clinical and laboratory research has failed to provide veri-

fication necessary to show a cause and effect role for smoking.
"3. Among scientists studying these problems, there is growing interest in
the possible role of constitutional and genetic factors.
"4. Inhalation of tobacco smoke by laboratory animals in many experiments
over the years has consistently failed to produce lung cancer. ~-
"5.
Some other things, such as viruses in combination with other factors,
have produced lung cancer in experimental animals.
"6. Extensive chemical tests have failed to specify any substance, as
found in cigarette smoke, that accounts for lung cancer. 1003543294

view that the quest for a single, simple 'magic bullet' to explain the causes or

provide the cure for cancer and of heart disease is unrealistic and probably futile.

the report and to consider the facts,
suggest a bias that no good doctor
should permit when he is dealing with

presented by cigarette smoking."
' = :OSerious Flaws'

Dr. Garland replies r "
"The report of the Roy al Col-?ege on
smoking has beem read in its entirety
and more than once. Its tenor and con.
clusions had been adumbrated during
its 36 months' gestation and were not
unexpected in the light of past cor-
respondence with its distinguished
composer . . .
,"What Dr. Fletcher seems to forget
or overlook is the fact that 'the metic-
ulous statistical work' on which the
association of cigarette smoking and
lung cancer is based is not regarded
as without serious flaws. Reference to
the many publications of such dis-

''medical tragedies, but let us keep it
in perspective: in the latest year for

primary lung cancer accounted for
only 1.8 percent of all reported deaths
in the United States."

1. Important knowledge of the
structure of viruses at the molecular
level is being obtained. There seems
to be a fundamental "unity in struc-
ture" between all viruses - plant, in-
sect, animal' and man - though they
may differ in size and other charac-
teristics.
2. Heretofore it had been believed
that only deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) was cancerogenic in experi-
mental work. Now it has been shown
that ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses
may produce cancer. (Dr. J. Huppert
of France reported he took an RNA
preparation from Ieukemic chickens,
injected it into other chickens and
induced leukemia in them.) Major
strides are heing made in chemical
analysis of the differences between
normal DNA ("the blueprint of life")
and the DNA that is cancerogenic.
3. More knowledge is being ob-
tained about how viruses replicate in
the cells they infect. Viruses can pro-
duce new enzymes to help their own
synthesis. Knowledge of the many
mechanisms involved will!be important
in future chemotherapy.
4. Reports on avian tumors are im-
portant because it is now firmly es-
tablished that tumor viruses from
chickens can induce various types of
cancer in mammals such as mice, rats,.

5. The human adenovirus 12, which
produces cancer when injected into
new-born hamsters, now has been
shown to induce cancers in mice.
Adenovirus 18, another human virus
responsible for common respiratory
disorders, has been shown to induce
cancers in rats as well as in hamsters.
(Dr. John Trentin of Baylor Uni-

Peptic Ulcers Often Found

Peptic ulcers are more frequently
found at autopsy with carcinomas of
the lung than with other carcinomas,
and this difference may be significant,
two Veterans Administration patholo-
gists report.*
In autopsies of 107 patients with
bronchogenic carcinoma at the VA
West Side Hospital, Chicago, Drs.
Simon J. Ramah and Bernhard Cho-
met found that 22 also showed gastric
or duodenal ulcers, an incidence of 21
percent. In 201 cases of cancer of
other organs (excluding cancer of the
stomach),,they found 21 instances (10
percent) of associated peptic ulcers.
Of the ulcers associated with lung
cancer, they note, 15 were chronic and
seven were acute.
Other workers have reported' simi-
lar associations, the Chicago patholo-
gists said.

e Cigarette Kin

Moat oi these careinoBens take 28 to 30 years to per-
:orm their evil duty in man. And annual tests frequentl:;
`taii to reveal such properties because carcinogens have

;~ diMerent effecta In different species.
Cigarette smoke fails into this class of causes of cancer•
` paiated on the skin of mice, cigarette tars raise skin
caacers. In several large statistical studies on man, thP
, lung cancer death rate among the two-pack-a-day me,r
= stands 80 titnes higher than among non-smokers. Iu
addition, cigarette smokers have a higher death rate from
:qther forms of cancer as well. °
This Is not the 'place to analyze all the data that' bind
:. cigarette smoking to eancer and to lung cancer in partlcu-
' lar. In the opinion of this writer, cigarette smoking is f.
:; cause (but not the only cause) of lung cancer and cigarette
smoke contains at least one carcinogen

.. In faot, the.oigaretta-lung cancer link Is the h~ttest
alue to come out of the laboratories in. the last. decade.
;.Unlike the occupational cancers, it• involvea large numbers
`of persons: 47.000 cases a year. But the solution,, alt)iough
~ ; cdmplicated by economics and strong personal habits: seems
; as straight-forward as the eliluination pf butter yellow as a
food color.
=' •' On a basic level, the scientists want 'to know how the
: cigarette carcinogen disarrays the delicate chemical ma-
chinery. This could provide essential data bearing on the


problem of "ultimate cause: ` ; .

Of course, scientists nave slso implicated air poliutioa
in lung csncer, although the eSect ia small when measured
against the cigarette effect. They know the air contains
carcinogens and the atatistics indicate a higher risJc to
lung cancer among city-bred men.

S-rays, ultra-violet light and high speed electrified
' particles also can chemically derail a normal cell. These
radiationa break molecules. apart, leaving fragmqnta with
a high degree of chemical affinity for normal chemicaL in
;, the cell. The instrusions can spell disaster.
We can never escape these radiationa. They swim up at
- us from the rocks below our feet; they assault us in the
form of cosmic rays from outer space; they enter our
:; . bodies with water thaA liaa run over rocks and with food
`: contaminated with rad3oaGtlve dust from atomic bomb tests.
And,linally, It is a rarr. person who has notqa$ for dental-
__ X-rays,had a cheat:L-rayor some sort of inefdi.esll exposure.
Scientlats nnd it diffieult to estiinat,e the J~upsct of this
-' radiation. The dosea are amall; far smaller thpn the load
of radium absorbed by the famous watch dial painters who
later came down with, bone cancer and smaller still than
the doses used by sciaatists in laboratories to cres,te cancers
:.in animals. But undoubtedly part of the natton'a cancer
burden comes from exposure to radiation.
However. the available knowledge about these rays
can be put to use. After fifty years of carelessnesa with
X-rays, the medical and dental professions have started to
cut down the dose, to protect susceptible parts of the body .
and to emphasize •only necessary X-rays. Ciovernmenta
habe begun-in this era of atomic energy-to regulatb
radiation. .
In recent years, the laboratories have accumulated new
evidence pointing to viruses aa direct causes of human can-
cer. If correct', the•theory would explain much of the mys-
terious behavior of cancer and even knit together the di.
verse effects of chemical carcinogens and radiation.
Like cells, viruses come In all shapes and sizes, but next
to a cell they are pygmies; some measure as little as
1/250:0o0th of aa inch across. Unlike the cell, they have a.
simple structure, something like a peach. The outer "meat"
consists of blocks of protein, symmetrically stacked like biI-
liard balis. The "pit" contains nucleic acid, the eame sort
of c.:rmical' that contains the cell's code of iifer _-V"
`

Self-Sustui»ing Virm

But a virus cannot carry out chemical reactions by it- ,
self; It has no bucket brigades. It works by injecting its nu- '
_, cleie acid into the cell to take over the cell machinery to
Produce more virus materials-more protein,•more nucleic
: acid. ,tn the process, the cell may die or it may start on a
;:d wild growth explosion.
Biologists have observed this occurrence with canc*r
virus Infecting chicken cells grown in test tubes. The :
atHicted cells begin to divide tnd alide over the normal '
cells lying next to them just sa cancer cells do In the
animal body.
By now, cancer experta have ieolated e more than a
dozen viruses that create cancers in animals-mice, ham- ''
':'aters, rats and rabbits. The viruses can fire up leukeinla, °'.
tumors of the lutig, salive,ry gland and other organs. In
:. _some cases, the scientiata have prepared vaccines that pro
tect the animal againat a particular cancer.
But despite claims to the contrary, the -scientista have
failed unequivocally to Isolate a cancer virus from a human
being, and with good reason
First viruses that produce cancer in one species may ~
,,
not do so in another.
Second, the virus, having started the cancer years be- ~
fore may have long since departed. And, finally, the vitvs ~
may start the cancer and go into hiding in the cell. Re- ~'
n:'; cently, experiments with chicken cancer showed that one :~
; cancer virus does go into hiding and needs a helper virus ' z
bo come out of the
cell.

Most 'of the recent"success with cancer viruses have ~
: rested on the technique of inocr.]ating newborn animals .~.
with extracts of animal tumors. To do such teats on new- `~
born human Infants wouid be unthinkable'to say nothing ;.
of the "practical" diTSculty of following up the children for
tivo t tdeenty=flve years
o..
lt may be too that ordinary infections=like a ilrua
,,

,
sore throat--could under special cii•cumstances fiare up '

into a cancer. Already scientists have found that two ordi-,;
nary throat virus can produce cancer in hamsters.
' And most disturbing of all is the possibility that our ;~
- virus vaccines for polio and measles may eontain such ean-
cer•viruses. Instead': scientists have isolated one virus called
SV-40 from polio vaccine that again causes cancer In ham ~;
sters, but may not do so in human beings. °~
Yy f~y
. Some Implications
~
' The virus theory has many implicationa It raises th ~'
posaibility that aclentista may be able to prepa
reavacci
ne
or series of vaccines against cancer. It suggests how car-
cinogens and S-rays may create cancer by °stirring ap"
_' eleeping cancer viruses.
Scientists have siready awakened a resting leukemia
virus by spraying mice with X-rays After cre tSn th ~~
a e e 1eu .~~
kemia with the raya they could recover vir
a ua that gave
+: leuke•mia to other animals. Chemicals mi ht f th
6 per orm e
"`same trick, and it Is conceivable, but not proved, that sub-
sts.nces like cigarette smoke and air pollutanta may do so.
In all of this there Is another central mystery: why
does the body permit the cancer to take hold and grow?
When threatened' with an Invasion by viruses, bacteria or
any other foreign object, cells within the body pour out
special chemicals to fight the invaders. These chemicale,
large prot'ein molecules called'antibodies, wrap themselves
around the germs and render them harmless.
Apparently the body has the ability to fight cancer In
this way. In experiments with human volunteera, doctors
Implanted cancer cells under the skin. The body rejected
them. But In order to make antibodies against a speciile invader, the antibody-making cel]s must "recognize" the
inxfader as foreign. They do so with cancer from another
human being. But cancer arising7rom its own tissues looks
too much like normal tissue for the antibody cells to react.
In addition to antibodies, the body has hormones-
chemicals that keep cell growth In check Bhould aome-
thing go wrong with one of the hormone-making glands.
.
the growth check would be too weak to keep a wild cancer
Cell from multiplying to 'killing proportions.

body are turning cancerous under the onslaught of carcino .~ •

Room For poubt On Cancer
Editor, The Record:
While I don't question F. W.
Weber's motives in his campaign
to eliminate smaYinA and drink-
ing from the American scene, I
do question his entire I-sided ar-
gument against tobacco com-
panies and other statements of
recent date. -
Mr. Weber March 10 asked V.
C. DeSimone if. he knows of a
more outstanding lung-cancer spe-
cialist than Dr. Alton Ochsner of
New Orleans, past president of the
American Cancer Society, whom
he quotes as saying that 95 per
- cent of all lung cancer is directly
caused by smoking and that every
one who smokes will eventually
`get this disease if he doesn't die
of a heart attack first. Yes, Mr.
Weber; I know of a Dr. Ian Mac-
Donald of the University of South-
- ern California medical teaching
,'staff, a distinguished cancer sur-
geon, a past director of the Amer-
ican Cancer Society and former
president of the American Cancer
Society's California brancb. United
Press International February 8
reported that Dr. MacDonald has
become angered and disenchanted
by the tactics of at least some
of the medical scientists and medi-
cal authorities who associate cig-
arette smoking with lung can-
cer and are showing more than
a hint of Volsteadism Intent.
The story says Dr. MacDonald
was agitated by a suspicion that'
modern Carrie Nations in science
were plotting to get an official
condemnation of cigarette smok-
ing from the American College of
Surgeons. He expressed' himself
in the college's technical organ.
His premise was that these med-
Ical scientists and practitioners
who believe cigarette smoking is
a cause of cancer have not made
a case for their belief. Their evi-
'dence is statistical, he said. It
has no biological link which will
stand up to scientific scrutiny, al-
though they have been trying to
find one for 7 years.
"What's more," he argued,
"their statistical evidence has
holes in it and they have been
10 03 C-'d ~2,5Z guilty of exaggerating. There is
~ T,,~ excellent statistical evidence that
their statistical evidence is en-
tirely wrong."
February 4' In Chicago the Amer-
ican Medical Association itself
made the following statement:
"Despite all the man-hours, all
'the millions of dollars,and alt the
hope and fear that have been
'poured into cancer dtsriag'the sci-
entifie revolution of lhe tOth Cen-
tury, the disease remains largely
an enigma.
"Nobody pretends to really know
when cancer will be cured or even
what causes it."
How different these statements
sound from the strident campaign
against cigarette smoking by the
Webers In the country. They would
never admit that smoking and
cancer are stjll under study, that'
there are doubts on the part of
many associated with cancer that
smoking is the culprit, and that
their arguments are the 1-sided
ones.
Let me point out to Weber that
when tuberculosis was running
rampant in the United States some
years back and was largely a
mystery, there were many promi-
nent physicians that blamed this
disease on smoking. We know dif-
ferently today. The same could
happen with cancer, whether
Weber willl admit it or not.

Off The Shelves
• Editor, The Record:
: AIr. John W. Orr also accuses
mc of being 1-sided.
As I told 750 students in Du-
mont High Scbool last Tuesday,
there are indeed two sides to the
=question of smoking and health.
One side is smoking. The other
side Is health. One side is money.
. The other side is truth.
Too many people worry about'
the possible Wall Street collapse
if cancer-causing cigarettes are.
prohibited in this nation.
-It's about time we choose be-'
tween:
1. Poison or people.
2. Money or men.
- 3. Ctgarettes or citizens.
. Mr. Orr quoted liberally and
loosely from his so-called famous
doctor expert, a Dr. Ian Mac-
. poaald:
', I conducted some slight re-
. search on this authority. ... I
did Indeed locate this man's,
name. .
. This same Dr. Ian MacDonald
was prominently listed as one of
the staunch defenders of the to-
bacco industry (before a Congres-
aional committee in 1957). He
works for the tobacco industry
research committee. His name
was right under that of Clarence
Cook Little, the king of this same
tobacco committee! .
The evidence against Thalido-
mide was'purely statistical - and
it's good they acted fast on this
statistical 'evidence, don't you
agree?
As was ~done with the suspect
tuna fish, a let's clear the shelves
.of cigarettes until Dr. Ian Mac-
Donald and his buddies prove that
cigarettes do not cause lung can.

ger's disease, leukoplakia, and
c,hronic bronch!tisd
Parenta are so concerned that
their darlings Lave polio shots;
70 people died of polia In 1962
'in all of America.
These same parents freely give
permission to their same darlings
to begin smoking at 12 years of
age; 41,000 Americans died of
lung cahcer In that same year

Dear Mr. Orr, be my guest at

Aashington -- An official of The Tobacco Institute, Inc. today outlined

six of the questions that scientists have raised about the theory linking

cigarette smoking to lung cancer.

Frank J. Welch, Executive Vice President, said that while smoking is
one of the many factors being studied, "Many scientists believe that singling

out tobacco as a major factor involved is not warranted by scientific knowledge."

He spoke to the Friendship Lions Club.

He listed these six questions about the smoking theory as among those

scientists:
. Why after years of research does the case against smoking still
rest largely on statistics, without the clinical and laboratory verification
"2. Why have years of animal experimentation consistently failed to
. produce lung cancer in animals by inhalation of tobacco smoke?
Scientists also ask why have chemical tests been unable to establish


"4. Why is the lung cancer death rate in the British Isles about twice
any substance, as found in smoke, that accounts for lnng cancer?
as high as in the U.S., even though per capita cigarette amoking,is much higher
"5• Why is there a sharp varia'tion in lung cancer rates from city to

that "nearly half of the cost of

"If automobiles were taxed at the same rate as cigarettes, a new $3,000

would cost about $6,000," according,to the Tax Council.

"Cigarettes have become the subject of tax exploitation,"'says the Tax
Council. Noting that several state legislatures this year have voted to increase
their tobacco levies, the Council states, "No one would contend that cigarettes

should escape taxation." However, "It is unreasonable to single out cigarettes

In 1962 tobacco taxes returned more than $1.1 billion to the 47,states and

the District of Columbia which impose special taxes. More than 97 percent of

the total was paid by cigarette smokers. In 1956 the total was $540;429,000.



With federal and 1oca1 taxes added, the total burden on tobacco users in
1962 was $3.2 billion, said Tobacco News.
"The federal and state governments together impose ttLces averaging L3'cents
per package, or four times as much as the growers receive," says the Tax Council.
The U.S. collects 8 cents on every package of cigarettes or more than $230,000
an hour. State taxes run from 2 to 8 cents a package.
A Census Bureau report shows that tobacco taxes averaged $5.91 per capita in
1962, more than the return from state property taxes, which averaged only $3.58•

Washington -- George V. Allen, President of The Tobacco

-_today issued the following statement:
~~.
r
restate and reaffirm the tobacco
I wish to

"Is a custom for adults and that it is not the intent of

:'=encourage smoking among youth.

, Because there has been some misunderstanding and criticism of
on this point, the Institute has offered the following suggestions, applicable
cigarette advertising in all media, for the attention of its members:
Cigarette advertisements should be characterized by good judgment
and good taste.
In keeping with the position of the industry that smoking is a
'custom for adults, cigarette advertisements should not give a contrary


ression. Persons featured in advertising should be, and should
appear to be, adults.

Television or radio programs and other media rThose content is
directed particularly to youthful audiences should not be sponsored

or used. Thus, good Sudgment in program content, rather than arbitrary
restriction of sponsorship to certain hours of the listening,or v'iewing

day, should be the determining factor.
It eil7l be recalled that on June 19, I stated that a number of individual
companies of the Institute had decided to discontinue college advertising and
promotional activiti'es.
The details of implementing the Institute's suggestions are, of course,
matters for the decision of individual companies. The Institute itself does not
monitor or regulate the advertising of its members.

Room For poubt On Cancer
Editor, The Record:
While I don't question F. W.
Weber's motives in his campaign
to eliminate smaYinA and drink-
ing from the American scene, I
do question his entire I-sided ar-
gument against tobacco com-
panies and other statements of
recent date. -
Mr. Weber March 10 asked V.
C. DeSimone if. he knows of a
more outstanding lung-cancer spe-
cialist than Dr. Alton Ochsner of
New Orleans, past president of the
American Cancer Society, whom
he quotes as saying that 95 per
- cent of all lung cancer is directly
caused by smoking and that every
one who smokes will eventually
`get this disease if he doesn't die
of a heart attack first. Yes, Mr.
Weber; I know of a Dr. Ian Mac-
Donald of the University of South-
- ern California medical teaching
,'staff, a distinguished cancer sur-
geon, a past director of the Amer-
ican Cancer Society and former
president of the American Cancer
Society's California brancb. United
Press International February 8
reported that Dr. MacDonald has
become angered and disenchanted
by the tactics of at least some
of the medical scientists and medi-
cal authorities who associate cig-
arette smoking with lung can-
cer and are showing more than
a hint of Volsteadism Intent.
The story says Dr. MacDonald
was agitated by a suspicion that'
modern Carrie Nations in science
were plotting to get an official
condemnation of cigarette smok-
ing from the American College of
Surgeons. He expressed' himself
in the college's technical organ.
His premise was that these med-
Ical scientists and practitioners
who believe cigarette smoking is
a cause of cancer have not made
a case for their belief. Their evi-
'dence is statistical, he said. It
has no biological link which will
stand up to scientific scrutiny, al-
though they have been trying to
find one for 7 years.
"What's more," he argued,
"their statistical evidence has
holes in it and they have been
10 03 C-'d ~2,5Z guilty of exaggerating. There is
~ T,,~ excellent statistical evidence that
their statistical evidence is en-
tirely wrong."
February 4' In Chicago the Amer-
ican Medical Association itself
made the following statement:
"Despite all the man-hours, all
'the millions of dollars,and alt the
hope and fear that have been
'poured into cancer dtsriag'the sci-
entifie revolution of lhe tOth Cen-
tury, the disease remains largely
an enigma.
"Nobody pretends to really know
when cancer will be cured or even
what causes it."
How different these statements
sound from the strident campaign
against cigarette smoking by the
Webers In the country. They would
never admit that smoking and
cancer are stjll under study, that'
there are doubts on the part of
many associated with cancer that
smoking is the culprit, and that
their arguments are the 1-sided
ones.
Let me point out to Weber that
when tuberculosis was running
rampant in the United States some
years back and was largely a
mystery, there were many promi-
nent physicians that blamed this
disease on smoking. We know dif-
ferently today. The same could
happen with cancer, whether
Weber willl admit it or not.

Off The Shelves
• Editor, The Record:
: AIr. John W. Orr also accuses
mc of being 1-sided.
As I told 750 students in Du-
mont High Scbool last Tuesday,
there are indeed two sides to the
=question of smoking and health.
One side is smoking. The other
side Is health. One side is money.
. The other side is truth.
Too many people worry about'
the possible Wall Street collapse
if cancer-causing cigarettes are.
prohibited in this nation.
-It's about time we choose be-'
tween:
1. Poison or people.
2. Money or men.
- 3. Ctgarettes or citizens.
. Mr. Orr quoted liberally and
loosely from his so-called famous
doctor expert, a Dr. Ian Mac-
. poaald:
', I conducted some slight re-
. search on this authority. ... I
did Indeed locate this man's,
name. .
. This same Dr. Ian MacDonald
was prominently listed as one of
the staunch defenders of the to-
bacco industry (before a Congres-
aional committee in 1957). He
works for the tobacco industry
research committee. His name
was right under that of Clarence
Cook Little, the king of this same
tobacco committee! .
The evidence against Thalido-
mide was'purely statistical - and
it's good they acted fast on this
statistical 'evidence, don't you
agree?
As was ~done with the suspect
tuna fish, a let's clear the shelves
.of cigarettes until Dr. Ian Mac-
Donald and his buddies prove that
cigarettes do not cause lung can.
'cer, heart attacks, ulcers, Buer-
ger's disease, leukoplakia, and
c,hronic bronch!tisd
Parenta are so concerned that
their darlings Lave polio shots;
70 people died of polia In 1962
'in all of America.
These same parents freely give
permission to their same darlings
to begin smoking at 12 years of
age; 41,000 Americans died of
lung cahcer In that same year
1962 (95 per cent of lung cancer
!s directly caused by amok-
1ng)•
Dear Mr. Orr, be my guest at
Dumont High School Friday,
April 5; and be firmly convinced
that even you should give up
smoking - along with all the iun-
fors and seniors in Dunnmont. ,.,
P. S. Bring along your buddy
Dr. Ian MacDonald. (Questions
solicited from all in attendance.)
Tobacco addiction is very close
to morphine addiction!

A study of findings in nearly 1000
autopsies indicates "that if an associ-
ation exists between smoking practices
and the development of arteriosclero-
sis or lesions resulting therefrom, it
is at best tenuous and inconclusive,"
two New York pathologists report.'
The published statistical linkage of
heavy cigarette smoking, to coronary
artery disease probably reflects more
distinct clinical symptoms of the dis-
ease in heavy smokers rather than a
cause and effect relationship, said
Drs. Sigmund' L. Wilens and Cassius
M. Plair, who studied 989 consecutive
autopsies on men performed at the
New York Veterans Administration
Hospital between 1958-1961.
"The relation between cigarette
smoking and heart attacks could be an
indirect or even a fortuitous one,"
they said.
The pathologists found evidence of
distinct myocardial infarcts inapprox-

CANCER !.TM VIRUSES AND CIGARETS -

New York City's Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer
Research (named after General Motors geniuses Alfred P.
Sloan Jr. and Charles F. Kettering) cognes up with a most
~ interesting report on
...viruses as possibly the
basic causes of,cancer. ..

stood nowadays, is, to

Alfred P. The hte CLarle: duced cancer in animals.
aloan Jr. F. Ketter~n~ There is as yet no proof

that any form of human cancer is caused by a virus. But

neither is there proof that it isn't.

Many cancer researth scientists believe that"the age-
long quest for a cure or preventive of cancer will end some-
where where in the field of virology-the science of viruses.
We of course don't pretend to be experts on all this.
' But as humble laymen, we make bold to express the opinion
that the current agitation against cigarets as an alleged
cause of lung cancer looks pretty premature and presump-
tuous in the-light of the Sloan-Kettering report.
Suppose viruses are eventually found to cause cancer
of all types, with cigarets entirely out of the picture. That,
this report strongly indicates, can easily happen.

If it should happen, the cigarets-cause-cancer people's
faces would- be very red, and they would have a lot of ex-
plainizlg to do to iohe well-meaning persons now financing
the anti-cigaret attacks on the tobacco farmers,, the tobacco
industry, and one of the favorite pastimes of tens of mil-

iions of Americans. -

Incidentally, there is nc laboratory proof that cigarets
ever gave cancer to a human being; and most cigaret smok=

ers never get lung cancer.
. Why not halt this whole anti-cigaret fight until all the
evidence is in, one way or the other?

How long until medical science cures cancer?
This question has taken on new urgency in the minds of many since
: the deaths of four Hollywood actors within 18 days of each other-
,;_;'' Charles Laughton, Thomas Mitchell, Jack Carson and Dick Powell.

The impact oi these headlines touched off what was described as a
"mild panic" among Southern California men, who pushed into cancer
detection centers in record num-
bers. you believe, for the chaos that'
;" That a cure will be found for pervaded the field a few decades
ago has been largely cleared
away. We seem to be coming
down to cases with the disease.
What Cancer Is
For one thing there is finally a
high degree of agreement on just
what cancer is-a disease of the
cells and growth gone haywire.
Certain a g e n t s (carcinogens)
such as some chemical com-
pounds, along with radiation and'~
possibly some viruses, seem to
have the ability to alter some body
cells and spur them into prolificc
uncontrolled reproduction. These
unnatural cells multiply so rapid-
ly that they destroy or crowd out
normal cells and' tissues.
The mechanism of this growth
is beiieved 'o be centered in the
genes of the cells-the chemicai
molecules of the nucleus which
dictate the functions of the cell.
When these ii7olecules are dis-
But despite all the man-hours, ---~pted by foreign chemieals, in- "'
vaded by a virus, or changed by
spears of radiation, then the nor-
mal dictates from the nucleus are
altered. For some reason these
alterations often touch off' can-
cerous growth.
Since all this activity takes
place in a minute world that can't
even be viewed by an electron
microscope, finding out what
changes take place in the cell
nucleus and how to stop it, is a
highly intricate and as yet un-
solved'task.
So, while we can say what con-
cancer seems well-nigh inevit-
able. More research and more
scientific articles touch on this
:" subject than any other, includingg
space and radiation-one of the
causes of cancer. .
':" It' is a subject which pervades
every medical specialty, and
forms the basis for what is prob-
;' ably the biggest worry in the Unit-
ed States today, outstripping even
the individual's concern over nu,
clear war. Sudden death can't
compete with the idea of linger-
ing suffering, which cancer con-
jures in the minds of many.
"I had the unhappy task of tell-
ing a man that the chest pains he
' was experiencing were due to a
bad heart," recalls one specialist,
; "Imagine my surprise when the
patient breathed a sigh of relief
and said, 'Thank goodness. I
thought it was lung cancer."'
; all the millions of dollars and all
the hope and fear that have have
'been poured into cancer during
the scientific revolution of the
Twentieth Century, the disease re-
-: mains largely an enigma. Nobody
pretends to really know when can-
cer will be cureA; or even what
causes it.
Where mankind stands in reia-
fion to cancer was made evident
at the American Medical Associa
tion's recent clinical meeting in
; Los Angeles. The picture is not
as gloomy as some would have

,...•,,.
cer is and how cancer goes about
its destruction, we still can't say
why cancer is-the factor which
would most clearly point' the way'

° to a cure or a preventative.

Ignoring all this, many re•
searchers have struck out direct-
ly in search of a cure-a process
which requires not only a high de-
gree of knowledge but years of
,'patience, as well as a little luck.
Drugs Tested
So far thousands and thousands
of drugs have been tested in the
hope of' finding one that would
ir_hibit' cancer. Some, such as
thio-tepa and flourouracii, have
shown enough promise to spur
hopes that we might be on the
track of a cure at last.
New techniques are being de-
vised constantly-the latest involv-
ing the use of highly toxic drugs
whi&amp; are injected into the blood
supply of the cancer tumor.
All of this, of course, is a long
--way from the type of cure that
penicillin, for instance, has made
possible in the case of pneumonia.
But as we learn more; as we ac-
cumulate a better understanding
of the why's and wherefore's of
cancer, the chances of a'''break-
through~' increase.
The search for this understand-
ing has narrowed into two general
concepts. One is that viruses are
at the root of human cancers. The
other that viruses are just one of
many irritating carcinogens.
Broadly speaking, the virus theory
holds that it takes both an irritant

Fate,' laments a tobacco executive,'has conspired to make this a testing time for
Our industry.' True, but most of the tobacco companies have done remarkably little

~ Chiefly because of health worries,, the cigarette market is fragmented as never before,

;; undermining brand loyalties and thereby boosting advertising costs.



In e summary and concluding paragraph FORBES says, "But given the magnitude of the
.~::~~3~ health problem~as it is now defined and the likelihood of more anti-cigarette campaigns
'.~ of unprecendented power and range, it is possible to think that the industry has roused
=A itself too late. It is prudent to entertain at least provisional doubts about the

``a,tobacco industry's ability to preserve without important loss its fabulous profitability.

3`To reassure its critics the tobacco industry will have to act; not merely react. It shows
~ only limited signs of doingso.''
,

~e
Th article is critical both of the industry's health research program and of the failure
~,,Az-of manufacturing companies to diversify. ::.

~' , Of research it says,t"But few outsiders are impressed by the energy of the TIRC effort

~;'to date. In the nine years since it was formed, TIRC has given a little over $6 million

in research grants. A single cigarette company can easily spend twice that amount in


--y~ a year just to launch one new brand in the national market."
,
:-.


x~•On diversification the article comments, "This reluctance to diversify is hard to under-
stand, considering the iadustry has marketing, adverti'sing and sales knowhow±.hat could

probably be use

P M. release, Friday, February 22, 1963.

Significant differences in physique between male smokers and non-smokers have been
~'found in a study by Harvard anthropologist Carl C. Seltzer, Ph.D., in an article to
,'be published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, February 23, 1963.

The A.M.A. iie~rs release says "The findings suggest that a biological factor is

"'thtl ftriht beii'larly involved in patients with lung cancer

Tobacco, a~oint publishing_venture of the American Public Health Association,

January. Last week informational copies were sent to newspapers throughout the country.

The Etening~Star story leads with an item from the Bulletin which predicts "more

Associated Press science writer Robert Goldstein quotes the President of the American

',Heart Association as saying the death rate of middle aged men from cardiovascular
disease has declined 6
percent since 1950. American Heart Association President
James V. Warren characterized this as "the first relatively sustained improvement
we have seen."

:;•"Prohibition Hint Seen in Cigaret Probe."' UNLTED~PRESS INTERNATIONAL and CHICAGO

TRLBUIZi;, February 9, 1963.


;~;-An article by Dr. Ian Macdonald published in Surgery, Gynecology and Obstetrics,
a medical journal of the American College of Surgeons is reported by the UPI wire
service. The news report says "At least some of the medical scientists and'medical
~ authorities who associate cigaret smoking with the lung cancer are showing 'more than
a hint of Volateadian intent,' in the view of the distinguished cancer surgeon,
Dr. Ian Macdonald." The UPI story also discusses Dr. Macdonald's views = the
evidence offered thus far in the tobacco and health controversy;
. ~
"His promise was that those medical scientists and practictioners who believe cigaret
smoking is a cause of lung cancer have not made a case for their belief. Their evidence
is statistical, he said. It has no 'biological link' which will stand up to scientific
scrutiny altho they have been trying to find one for seven years. ''
;' "What's more, he argued,•their statistical evidence has holes in it and they have been
guilty of exaggerating. There is excellent statistical evidence that their statistical
;evidence is entirely wrong, he said."
