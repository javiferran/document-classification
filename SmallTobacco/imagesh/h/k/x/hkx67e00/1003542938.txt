*“Perhaps then the scientists can:

that must be undertaken and work
together to.solve these health: prob-

the National’ Association of State
‘Departments of Agriculture here.

About 50 department heads had
registered for the conference this
morning.

. “Sheer Repetition

Allen said that ‘by sheer repeti-
tion,” critics. of smoking ‘are. now
seeking to give ihe impression of
‘mounting evidence’ that smoking
is responsible for various health
problems, even though the causes
of these problems. remain in. dis-
pute among scientists. :
. “Actually, while there have been
many resolutions and repeated
stories and articles about smoking

and health in the recent past; the —

scientific situation remains large-
ly as it. was.”

Allen sala that “the litera.ure
on tobacco and health contains.
such a wide variety of fiction and!
non-fiction, fact and opinion, that

it is difficult, at best, to determine -

what the facts really are,

“However,, when one considers’
all of the available research, one
finds that much of it does not fit,
the theory as presented by those
who regard smoking as.a serious
health hazard.

“Tt is natural that the headlines

usually go to those who suggest a
possible answer to health prob-
lems, or who present a new theory
or who make a charge.
-“However, ‘a chorus of loud
voices saying that tobacco is
‘guilty’ is no substitute for re-

-- Search.

“The position of the tobacco in-

dustry, on the other hand, does

not generally make much. news,”
he said, because ‘‘we do noti pre
sume to know the answers... ..

Certain Things

“There are certain things we
do know,” Allen said:

“We do know that the theories
regarding possible causes of lung
cancer and hearti disease are in
dispute among scientists.

“We do know thati the original:
theory about smoking and Jung
cancer — the theory: that. smoke
was a direct, contact carcinogen--
has virtually been. abandoned,

“We do know. that. in labora-

tories around’ the. world scientists .
are investigating many possible

factors in lung cancer and heart
disease, in addition to smoking.”

Allen noted that the ‘case
against smoking still rests largely
on statistical studies, whose mean-
ings are questicned by many Jead-
ing medical statisticians.”

He also said that “intensive
clinical and laboratory. research
has failed: to provide the verifica-
tion necessary to show: a cause
and effect role for smoking."

Allen. is a former director of the
U.S. Information Agency, and a
career ambassador in the Foreign
Service.

The Tobacco Institute is cors-
posed of major U.. S. manufac-
turers of cigarettes, smoking to

‘bacco and‘other tobacco. products.

Its principal purposes are to pro-
mote a hetter understanding of
the tobacco industry and to dis-
seminate information relating ts
the industry.

A to-

Monday for more research and
less guessing into the effects of
smoking on. health.

President George V. Allen of the
Tobacco Institute said scientists
are in disagreement: on theories
regarding. causes of lung cancer
and heart disease.

Allen, whose organization was
set up to give the industry’s side
in the smoking-health controversy,
made the comments in a speech
prepared for a meeting of the Na-
tional Association of State Depart-
ments of Agriculture.

A “respite from theories, reso-
lutions and emotional statements,”
he said, would give scientists a
chance to perform the necessary
research. -

“Uniess this happens,’” he add-
ed, “there is some danger of los-
ing sight of what ought to be the
basic objective of all concerned—
to: expedite the research still nec-
essary, and what role, if any, to-
baceo may play.”

Critics of smoking, Allen de-
clared, are using sheer repctition

to: give the impression: of “‘mount-
ing evidence” that tobacco is: re-

sponsible for a number of health
problems.

“The literature on. tobacco and
health contains such a wide. va-
riety of fiction and non-fiction,
