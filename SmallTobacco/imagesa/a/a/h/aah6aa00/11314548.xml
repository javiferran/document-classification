Cassette
recorders
up 150%
Sales expected to hit
$350 million in 1970;
tape volume also soars
Time was when only a relatively
few Americans owned tape re-
corders. 'Most of them were the "hi-
fi" hobbyists, who were willing to
put up with the need for threading
tape from one reel to another ...
with the agony of watching tape
come spilling out of the machiner,,
•
in wild disarray because of some
malfunction.
The dedicated hi-fi aficionados
still, for the most part, stay with
their open-reel machines. But mil-
lions of the more fumble-fingered
public have come into the tape re-
corder market, as a result of the ad-
vent of the cassette-the self-con-
tained unit in which tape moves
from one reel to the other without
need for the user ever to touch the
reel or the tape.
So ppopu.la,r„ so ubiquitous has the
cassette recorder become that indus-
try leaders estimate 'U. S. retail vol-
ume will reach $350 million in 1970.
This would represent an increase of
more than 150% over 1969.
AAMERICAN DRUGGIST'S most re-
cent big ticket survey indicated that
more than 1G,000 drug stores car-
ried cassette recorders.
Nor is the business limited to the
recording devices. A cassette re-
corder is of no use without cassette
tape-and sales of blank tape are
expected to exceed $80 million this
year.
While no one knows for sure-
because the market is still in its for-
mative stages-what percentage of
the business is done by drug stores,
guesses by those in the field vary
frb+m 151%d to 17%.

Philips Roxane has rescinded a change in
wholesaler terms from 1%-30 days to 1%-10
