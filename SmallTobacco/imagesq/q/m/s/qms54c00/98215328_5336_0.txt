RE: LORILLARD MARKET OVERVIEWS — BASED ON

EXCEL RETAIL DATA FOR 12 MONTHS ENDING JUNE, 2000

 

Attached are Lorillard Market Overviews for the 12 months ending June, 2000 based on EXCEL Retail Data. These
data reflect the location of each retail store being supplied by wholesalers participating in our EXCEL Program. In
contrast, MSA Shipment Data are based on the location of each wholesaler’s warehouse and are, therefore, less
representative of actual consumption within a market.

Total volume reported by EXCEL participants represents approximately 95% of corresponding national industry
shipments and 406,297 retail stores. .

Specific EXCEL data summarized for the Industry, key market segments, and companies by brand i in each Lorillard
Area, Region, and Division include the following:

- % of U.S. Volume

- Share of Market

- Share point change vs. year ago

- Share Development Indices (SDI's) vs. U.S. levels

In addition, the total number of retail stores on which data are based are shown for each market. Finally, note that
EXCEL data cover all manufacturers and brands. As a result, totals shown for “All Other Manufacturers” include
all available products.
