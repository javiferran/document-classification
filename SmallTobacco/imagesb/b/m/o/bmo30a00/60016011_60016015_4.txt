Title: "FASEB Summer Research Conference: Chromatin and Transcription"

.N/IA .

. Funds were requested for partial support (44%) for the third FASEB Summer Research Conference

on "Chromatin and Transcription," which will be held on June 24-29, 1995 at the Conference Center
at Snowmass Village, Colorado. A primary objective of the conference is to bring together
researchers who study transcription factors, chromatin structure, and higher-order nuclear
organization.

This grant requests funds for partial support of the FASEB meeting (44%).

. Because this grant requests partial support, there would be no adjustments. It is extremely unlikely

that the NIH will provide more than $5,000 support for this meeting.
