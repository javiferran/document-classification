- Dear Ray:

One of my colleagues at the American Cancer Society sent me
the Report of the Council for Tobacco Research-U.S.A., Inc., 1992.
You are listed there as being an american Cancer Society Professor
of Cellular and Developmental Biology and that is mentioned again.
in the introduction (see enclosed). While the Society is very
grateful for your using your American Cancer Society title in
publications and public appearances and the like, it is not.
appropriate, it seems to us, to have it listed with the Council for
Tobacco Research. For our staff and volunteers this is a conflict
of interest--that at least is the perception. These are the people
that bring us products that Kill a half million Americans a year,
and for the American Cancer Society to be in any way associated
with the Council for Tobacco Research lends it credibility that is
frankly embarrassing.

We certainly recognize that the members of the Scientific

Advisory Board are a distinguished group of people who are making
sincere efforts on behalf of research. Please don’t take this

. request personally, put I hope you understand the sensitivity that”

we have to this issue of tobacco and cancer. They are not very
broad minded when it comes to dealing with some investigators that

are funded by the American Cancer Society who provide information
which they don’t like--in fact, the tobacco companies have severely
pressured several scientists funded by the Society.

I wish you continued success and look forward to seeing you at
the Professors’ meeting. With alk best wishes.

Sincerely,

plow

Jo Laszlo, M.D.
