HEART SOCIETY
FINDS CIGARETS
ABET ATTACKS

New York, June 8 (#--The
American Heart association
went on record today for the
first time in favor of active
steps to discourage cigaret
smoking on the ground it is
harmful to health.

The acti by the board of
directors opens the way for the
association to work with other
groups in campaigns against
smoking.

The association said a 2060

report by a special

of physicians and sclentists
showed that death rates in
middle-aged men from heart
attacks were 60 to 150 per cent
higher among heavy cigarel
emeckers than among fon-
smeckers.

“These slatistics do not prove
that heavy cigaret smoking
causes corcnary heart disease,
it sald, “but the data strongly
suggests that heavy cigarel
smoking may contribute to or
accelerate the development of
coronary heart disease or its
complications.”
