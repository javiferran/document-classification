The case has been closely. watched by the
accounting profession and is expected by many
experts in the field to have a far-reaching im-
pact whatever the final outcome. This is be-
cause a key element was whether the three Ly-
brand men violated so-called generally, accept-
ed accounting principles in their dealings with
Continental Vending.

1962, Reports Involved

In essence, the Lybrand men were charged
with conspiring to put. false information in the
vending concern's 1962. financial reports to},
shareholders. and the Securities and Exchange |
Commission, andi with conspiring to leave out
some material facts from the reports.

i During two lengthy trials, the first of which
ended in a hung jury, the Government and de-
fendants both called upon expert witnesses. who
isharply, contradicted each other over what are

jury's verdict, however, Judge Mansfield sug-

The penalties imposed on the accountants
could have been much stiffer. Each of the
three counts carry. in addition to fines, a possi-
ble. prison term of up to five years. Judge
Mansfield, however, said at the. outset of the
sentencing that he saw “no purpose to. be]!

Judge Mansfield made the statement. °-:..,

“Sloppy Bit of Business” : es
Judge Mansfield said the accountants were
guilty of ‘‘a pretty, sloppy. bit of business” in
putting together a footnote for Continenta.
Vending’s 1962 balance sheet. The footnote lat-
‘er turned out to be.a major element in the Gov-
‘ernment’s case. The. Government contended
the footnote misled: readers of the statement
into believing that a major asset in the form of
an account receivable from Valley Commercial
Corp., an affiliate, was adequately secured by:
collateral. The Government also. charged that
the footnote covered up the true status of the
| collectibility of the receivable.
’ The Government had charged the footnote
helped conceal the fact that Harold Roth, the
former president of Continental Vending, was
actually siphoning off money. from: the compa-
“ny for his personal! use through Valley Com-

| mercial, which he also controlled.. wes

Mr. Roth was named as a defendant, along :
with the three Lybrand men, when a Federal |
grand: jury returned an indictment in October
1966. He later pleaded guilty to one count of
conspiracy andi appeared as a witness for the
prosecution in the accountants’ trial. Mr. Roth
is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 8. Still open
against him are five mail-fraud counts. «734
