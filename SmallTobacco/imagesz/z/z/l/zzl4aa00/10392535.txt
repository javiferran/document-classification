Dear Len:

Thank you so much for enclosing that exceedingly interesting paper by
Martensson, Larsson and Zettergren dealing with malignant mesothelioma
in siblings. It is of interest that cases one and two are both epithelial
types of malignant mesothelioma. Finally, and most extraordinary, in
cases three and four, both were biphasic types and had the dominating
fibrous component. The latter were identical twins. This, of course,
fosters our hypothesis of high genetic specificity relevant to the
histologic form of mesothelioma. This is very timely indeed in that we
have a paper (enclosed) in press in Cancer Genetics and Cytogenetics.
This project of mine was supported by CTR. T will let you know when it
is published which should be very shortly since I returned the galleys.

Things are moving slowyy, but hopefully, steadily with respect to HCI.

   

Sincerely,

 
   

Henry T. Lynch, 4.0.
