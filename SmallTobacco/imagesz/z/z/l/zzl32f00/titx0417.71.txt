Dear Mr. Chairman:

Thank you for your letter of March 11, suggesting that
the Public Health Service undertake an evaluation of
research done on the effects of the vapor phase of
cigarette smoke on human health.-

, The Surgeon General is in accord with your feeling
that such an evaluation would be useful at this time.
Accordingly, he has asked me and others involved with
the problem to proceed. I will keep you informed of
our progress.

oof;

~ The Public Health Service continues to be encouraged

and heartened by your interest in the smoking and health
problem and your support of efforts to reduce the burden.
of this health hazard on millions of Americans.

Sincerely yours,

Daniel Horn, Ph.D.
Director
National Clearinghouse for

Smoking and Health
