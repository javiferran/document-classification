Cambridge, MA -- Although the health department wants to pursue a

complete ban on smoking, they're apparently willing to listen to arguments from
restaurant owners and allowing some exceptions. Also, at least three city
council members (two plus the mayor) have agreed to rescind the city's
ordinances on smoking to make way for whatever the health department
decides. Two councilors are undecided. The other four are against allowing the
health department enact a smoking ban. The public health commissioner

feels an agreement will be reached between the restaurants and the health
department. However, no matter what that agreement is this time, he thinks
the town will ban smoking in restaurants and bars in the very near future.

To help defeat the self-service display proposal also before the board,

Bob Stone requests a mailing to retailers to encourage written comments to

the city council and the board,

Solano County, Calif. -- On 8/4, the supervisors will consider a plan to
ban smoking outside the entraces of county building.
