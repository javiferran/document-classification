GENERAL COMMENTS /FINDINGS

Thé 0-O-H medium was dominanted by Winston with Marlboro being just "barely
visible" (only 3 paints were observed in the marketplace). While Marlboro
did have some paints at key access roads, they had no 30-sheet showing at
all. This may be in part due to the fact that they frequently alternate
showings with Benson & Hedges and it was not their month to be up.

Our paints had good locations andin combination with our 30 sheet showing
gave us great impact in the market.

Two other brands, Old Gold Box and Lark also had significant showings in the
market (both 30-sheet & paints), while Pall Mall Gold, Benson & Hedges, Kent
and L&M had "minor" showings.

CONCLUS IONS

While Marlboro did not appear to be a significant factor in the O-O-H medium
at this particular point in time, they nonetheless enjoy almost a 23% share
of market vs our 13.7. Because they are doing so well in this market, they
may have diverted funds into other less developed areas. If we could in-
crease the length of our 30-sheet showing from 6 to 12 months, we might be
able to increase our share in ‘this traditionally strong Marlboro market.
