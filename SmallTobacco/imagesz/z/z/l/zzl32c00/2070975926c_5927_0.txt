Thad a long conversation with Mary JO. Ym fine with the follow up to the
specific incident & the handling of the corporate affairs contribution.

However ~- I'm really concerned (&very cynical) about what might be
happening. 1 suspect this was not by coincidence. I'm not sure how much it
was preplanned -~ but Mary Jo can share with several different scenarios that
we brainstormed.

Mary Jo promised to keep on alert for any unusual activity in the current 3
markets ~~ and is going to think about whether there are any preventative
steps we can/should take.
