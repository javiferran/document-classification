Dear Susan:
i ke Elimin - Airli

I am sorry about my delay in writing about this filter and in truth have
little to say about it.

There are several high efficiency filters available that work on a similar
principle, ic. prefilter, high efficiency particle filter, then charcoal
absorbent material. They are indeed efficient and efficiencies of 95 to 98%
for smoke particles are usual claims (LR&G’s 99.6 to 99.9% seems
unnecessarily ambitious). The odor elimination efficiency of 88% is also
higher than most manufacturers claim, but only tests would confirm or
disprove this data.

I suspect that the real problem will be an operational life. Airline particle
filters apparently clog fairly quickly and need to be changed frequently. If
one inserts a more efficient filter, I would expect it to clog more quickly
and would expect high pressure drops through the filter. This, however, is
again subject to proper trials.

I do, however, find it hard to believe that their layer of "charcoal paper"
would last long as an odor controller. Banks of charcoal rapidly loose
efficiency as absorbers of odors and need frequent replacement, and their
brief literature describes a “paper film" of charcoal, not a bank of material.
{ would be surprised if the odor removed efficiency stayed at 80% for 1,000
hours, never mind the 3,000 to 6,000 hour claim.

I would like to think these would work as well as they claim, but I doubt
it,

Kindest regards,

ADL.
