Re: Coupons and Sales Tax in South Carolina

Dear Ron:

have discussed the above matter with Frank Skinner of our tax department,
who is knowledgeable in the area. He also believes that there is a problem with the
way South Carolina is approaching this matter and is willing to offer his help.
Please feel free to call him at (336) 741-0262.

I assume this was the subject of your call the other week; however, if it is
not, please zive me a ring.

Best personal regards.
Sincerely yours,
