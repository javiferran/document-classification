facilities to perform a number of studies of interest
to our testing program and may be considered for future
work. A monitoring visit was also made to Hazleton
Laboratories in Munster, West Germany.

Also, at this time, T. A. Vollmuth visited AMESA

Technologies in Geneva, Switzerland. AMESA is scheduled

to deliver the first smoking machine to Microbiological
Associates at the end of May. The remaining machines
will be delivered in September. During the visit, a
design modification was proposed and agreed upon for
the machines to accommodate 100 mm cigarettes. A list
of necessary spare parts was reviewed and subsequently
ordered. The animal restraint tubes were shipped to
and received in good condition by Microbiological
Associates.

Equipment

Laboratory equipment arrived at the lab in preparation

for setting up our in vitro testing program to support

the Cigarette Modification Project. Equipment received
included a C02 incubator, centrifuge, peristaltic pump,
and fraction collector.

 

A request to purchase a Hamburg RM20CS Smoking Machine,
for use in an in vitro smoke exposure system, was made.
Approval to order this machine is pending. Preliminary
design specifications for the construction of the smoke
exposure system were discussed with Dave Grider and

Leroy Webb.
