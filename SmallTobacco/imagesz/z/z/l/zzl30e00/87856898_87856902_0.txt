SUBJECT: Monthly Summary Report for Life Sciences Section:
April

The following text is a summary of the activity of the Life
Sciences section during the month of April, 1987. For the most _
â€˜part, this report is organized by study.

1. AMES ASSAY (Hazleton Laboratories America)

The following compounds were sent out for testing in April:
BOO6, B212,

The following report was received and accepted as final:
B208.

2. AMES ASSAY (Lorillard Research Center)

The following reports were accepted as finals: A078, AO91,
A093, A143, BO59, B061, B208, B209, B210, B211.

Several Cigarette Smoke Condensates, including D019, D023,
D029, D033, D034 and Reference samples were tested for
comparative mutagenicity in the Ames assay. Very little
evidence of mutagenicity was exhibited for these samples and
no obvious differences were noted between samples. Since
these samples were frozen prior to testing, it is thought
that more reliable results might be obtained with fresher
samples. This may be pursued in a future study.

3. UDS ASSAY (Microbiological Associates)
The following compounds were sent out for testing in April:

B004, BO10, B129, B144.

4. UDS ASSAY (Hazleton Laboratories America)

S689S82L8

Final revisions were made to the UDS protocol and approval
given for Hazleton to test compounds at a rate of 4 per month.
