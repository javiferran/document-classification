Dear Ms. Lipic:

Thank you for your interest in The Tobacco
Institute's new youth initiatives. These initiatives
are designed to discourage young people from smoking
and to prevent their access to cigarettes. These steps
expand upon and reaffirm previous actions taken by the
industry to steer its product away from young people.

I'm happy to send you several copies of "Tobacco:
Helping Youth Say No," as you requested. The booklet
is designed to help adults help children resist peer
pressure to smoke. The booklet provides guidance and
actual techniques parents can use to talk to their
children about peer pressure, which is one of the
primary reasons children smoke. It can also be used by
educators, to help them in discussing the subject with
students.

The industry is committed to a long-term program
to discourage young people from smoking.

Sincerely,

Wy dhanis. Wiel.

Melanie Merkle
