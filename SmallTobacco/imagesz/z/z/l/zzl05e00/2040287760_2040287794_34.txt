In addition, an independent survey conducted by the SPAR Marketing Group
across 540 self-service stores also confirms the results from IRI’s
supermarket scanning data base (InfoScan). It should be noted that IRI
will tend to have somewhat lower numbers overall as the sample includes
some non self-service outlets.
