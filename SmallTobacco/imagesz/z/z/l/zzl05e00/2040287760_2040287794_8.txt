R.J. Reynolds’ 1989 strategy reflects a decline in coupon support behind
several of the company’s key brands including Doral, Camel and Winston.

Although RJR has pulled back coupon activity for Camel, the company has

continued: to support the brand in pack outlets with various retail pack

promotions. Further, Reynolds maintained heavy coupon support for Salem
in 1989, likely in an effort to combat competitive in-roads made by

Alpine.

During Fourth Quarter 1989, RJR decreased coupon activity for Doral,
Winston and Camel relative to the same period in 1988. However, the
company continued to support Salem and increased coupon activity for
Now.
