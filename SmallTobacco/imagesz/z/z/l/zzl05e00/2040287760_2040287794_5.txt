SOURCE OF COUPON INFORMATION

 

This report provides Fourth Quarter 1989 and Annual 1989 results of
coupon redemption and share of market information as reported by IRI’s
supermarket and drug store scanning data. The coupon redemption
anformation is based on media-delivered (i.e. FSI’s), direct mail and
in-store activity (on-carton/on-pack).

IRI currently supplies Philip Morris with consumer panel data which
details the purchasing patterns of 13,000 households from seventeen
markets across the U.S.:

St. Louis, Missouri
Denver, Colorado

Rome, Georgia

Pittsfield, Massachusetts
Detroit, Michigan
Minneapolis, Minnesota
Kansas City, Missouri
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

Marion, Indiana

Eau Claire, Wisconsin
Midland, Texas

Grand Junction, Colorado
Salem, Oregon

Cedar Rapids, Iowa
Memphis, Tennessee
Seattle, Washington
Cleveland, Ohio

This consumer household panel information has some limitations since the
available markets tend to be relatively well developed price value areas
(SDI: 131) and the data tends to under-represent younger males and
certain ethnic groups. However, despite limitations, the data has
proved to be a reliable coupon tracking source following a validation
made using Kankakee redemption information and a comparison to an
independent survey (reference attached IRI Validation Study}.

In addition, information based on media-delivered coupon activity
(supplied by the Advertising Checking Bureau) is also included.
