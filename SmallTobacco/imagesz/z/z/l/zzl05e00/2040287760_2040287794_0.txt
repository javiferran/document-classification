FOURTH QUARTER 1989 AND ANNUAL 1989 RECAP

HIGHLIGHTS - ANNUAL 1989

 

e Twenty-five percent of total industry volume purchased in supermarkets and
drug stores was with a coupon incentive during calendar year 1989, unchanged
from 1988's level. An increase in Price Value couponing (44% of volume/+7
points versus year-ago) was offset by a slight decline in Full Margin
couponing (20% of volume/-1 point vs. 1988).

e Only nine percent of Full Margin cigarette volume was sold with coupons
delivered at retail in 1989. In contrast, in-store coupon activity for the
Price Value category is substantially higher, with 42% of volume sold
accompanied by an on-carton/on-pack coupon. Practically all of Philip
Morris’ couponed volume is via on-carton/on-pack coupons, and is obviously
tied to support behind Cambridge and Alpine. While 32% of RJR’s total volume
sold in the supermarket and drug store universe is with a coupon incentive,
only 12% of the manufacturer’s sales was via an on-carton/on-pack coupon.
The majority of RUR’s coupon activity (accounting for 20% of volume) is
delivered through direct mail, FSI and ROP. RJR’s reliance on FSI’s, Direct
Mail and ROP couponing is further emphasized by the fact that the
manufacturer accounted for over 40% of total industry media-delivered

activity during 1989.
