COUPON TYPES

 

On-carton/on-pack activity continued to be the primary coupon delivery
vehicle, as 67% of all coupons redeemed during Fourth Quarter 1989 were
in this category. During Fourth Quarter 1989 the use of Direct Mail
increased somewhat (+6 points) versus the same period year-ago, with RJR
and Lorillard utilizing this vehicle to a greater extent.

While the Price Value category utilize on-carton/on-pack coupons almost
exclusively, Full Margin brands’ in-store activity was substantially
lower with only 9% of volume sold with this coupon type.

Nearly all of PM’s couponed volume used an on-carton/on-pack coupon
(11%), just slightly below RJR, which used in-store coupons to sell 12%
of the company’s volume. Twenty percent of RJR’s volume was sold with
an FSI, Direct Mail or ROP coupon.
