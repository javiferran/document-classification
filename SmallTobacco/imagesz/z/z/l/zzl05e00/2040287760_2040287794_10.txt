During Fourth Quarter 1989, Liggett increased support behind Eve (+11
points to 25% of volume), apparently responding to competitive threats
posed by the Virginia Slims Superslims introduction. Further, with the
exception of Eve, during the most recent period all of Liggett’s
couponed brands utilized values greater than $2.00.

Note, less than one percent of Pyramid’s volume is sold with a coupon
incentive. .
