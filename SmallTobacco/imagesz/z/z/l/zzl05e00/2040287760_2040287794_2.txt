e While R.d. Reynolds’ overall coupon activity declined only marginally,
year-to-year, the manufacturer did significantly alter their couponing
strategy. During 1989 RJR relied heavily on $1.00 coupon values
across their Full Margin brands, while decreasing the use of $1.50 and
$2.00 values. As a percent of RUR’s total Full Margin couponed
volume, $2.00 values accounted for approximately 32% of activity in
1989, -21 points versus year-ago. At this same time, the importance
of $1.00 couponing activity increased 27 points, accounting for 48% of
Reynolds’ Full Margin coupon activity in 1989.

While the majority of Doral’s coupons in 1989 were $2.00 values, recent
information (through January 28, 1990) indicates that RJR is
strategically placing higher Doral coupon values ($2.50/$3.00) in
markets in which Pyramid and Bristol are making in-roads. In addition,
outside these $2.50/$3.00 markets, Doral seems to be reducing the
brand’s availability of coupons.

Marketing Information & Analysis will issue a separate report this month
analyzing RJR’s recent Doral coupon strategy and the brand’s impact on
Cambridge’s share trends.

HIGHLIGHTS - FOURTH QUARTER 1989

e Fourth Quarter 1989 coupon activity (26% of industry volume) was also
unchanged versus the same period in 1988. Compared to the first half
of 1989, Fourth Quarter coupon activity was stable for both the Full
Margin and Price Value categories, as the percent of volume moved on a
coupon incentive was 20% and 44%, respectively.
