On an annual basis, twenty-five percent of industry volume was sold
through with a coupon incentive during 1989, unchanged from 1988's

level.

Full Margin couponing declined slightly (-1 point to 20% of

volume), although Price Value activity increased versus last year (+7

points to 44% of volume).

RJR continued to exhibit the highest level of

coupon activity across the manufacturers (although only slightly ahead
of American and B&W) with 32% of volume as the company’s couponing
declined two points versus 1988.

During Fourth Quarter 1989, industry coupon activity (26% of volume)

remained unchanged versus the same period in 1988.

B&W, with 40% of

volume sold on coupon, exhibited the highest level of coupon activity
across the manufacturers in this particular quarter, giving added coupon
support to all of the manufacturer’s major brands except for Raleigh and

Belair.

With an increase in American’s Fourth Quarter 1989 coupon

activity (+4 points to 35% of volume), the manufacturer had the second

highest level of couponing in the industry.
behind American Lights, Malibu and Pall Mall.

American increased support
Note, this is the first

time that Reynolds has not lead the industry in the amount of couponing
activity since this information has been tracked.
