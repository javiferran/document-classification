ACB, which tracks media-delivered coupon activity, shows an increase in
industry activity during 1989 versus year-ago levels (+16%). With the
exception of RJR, all of the manufacturers increased the use of
media-delivered couponing in 1989. However, RJR uses this vehicle more
than any of the other manufacturers, achieving a 42% share of total
coupon circulation.

The majority of coupon activity is centered around the use of FSI’s,
accounting for 73% of media-delivered coupons in 1989.
