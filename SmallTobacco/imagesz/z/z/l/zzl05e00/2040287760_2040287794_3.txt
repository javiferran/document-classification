e During Fourth Quarter 1989, industry coupon activity (26% of volume)
remained unchanged versus the same period in 1988. B&W, with 40% of
volume sold on coupon, exhibited the highest level of coupon activity
across the manufacturers in this particular quarter, giving added
coupon support to all of the manufacturer’s major brands except for
Raleigh and Belair. With an increase in American’s Fourth Quarter
1989 coupon activity (+4 points to 35% of volume), the manufacturer
had the second highest level of couponing in the industry. American
increased support behind American Lights, Malibu and Pall Mall. Note,
this is the first time that Reynolds has not lead the industry in the
amount of couponing activity since this information has been tracked.

e During Fourth Quarter 1989, Philip Morris’ coupon activity increased
to 15% of volume, +3 points versus year-ago. The increase in PM’s
couponed volume is attributed to various Fourth Quarter programs by
Cambridge (Big Bonus), Alpine, Virginia Slims (Superslims’
introduction: $2.00 on-carton coupon/free pack/50¢ off 2-pack) and
Benson & Hedges ($1.00 media-delivered and $2.00 direct mail).

e RUR’s Fourth Quarter 1989 activity was four points Tower than the same

period in 1988, as 31% of the manufacturer’s volume was sold with a
coupon incentive. Decreased support was most evident for Winston (-11
points), Camel (-10 points) and Doral (-8 points). While Salem’s
coupon support was unchanged in Fourth Quarter 1989 versus year-ago
(36% of volume), Vantage’s coupon activity increased seven points to
48%.
