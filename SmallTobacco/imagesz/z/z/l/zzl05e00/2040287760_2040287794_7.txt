Philip Morris’ 1989 coupon activity increased two points versus 1988,
primarily tied to Cambridge (+12 points to 62% of volume). Cambridge’s
higher level of couponed volume is partially attributed to the Value
Shopping Network and Big Bonus promotions.

During Fourth Quarter 1989, PM’s coupon activity was up three points
versus the same period in 1988. Fourth Quarter programs by several
brands contributed to this increase: Cambridge (Big Bonus/$2.00
on-carton coupon), Virginia Slims Superslims introduction ($2.00
on-carton coupon/free pack/50¢ off 2-pack purchase) and Benson & Hedges
($1.00 Media-delivered/$1.00 & $2.00 Direct Mail).
