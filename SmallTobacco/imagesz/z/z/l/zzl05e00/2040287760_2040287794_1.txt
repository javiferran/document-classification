e Philip Morris’ couponed volume in 1989 was 15%, up two points versus
last year. This increase in couponed volume is primarily attributed
to Cambridge (+12 points to 62% of brand volume), as the brand
executed two large promotions in 1989 (Value Shopping Network and Big
Bonus). Alpine, in the brand’s introduction year, sold 65% of the
brand’s volume on a coupon incentive, the highest across PM brands.

@ @ RUR’s 1989 strategy reflected a slight reduction in overall coupon
support behind several of the company’s key brands: Doral (-4
points), Camel (-5 points) and Winston (-8 points). Salem, which sold
37% of the brand’s volume with a coupon incentive (+8 points), was
given additional support, likely as a result of Alpine’s introduction.
Vantage’s coupon activity remained at relatively high levels in 1989,
with 48% of the brand’s volume supported with a coupon (+4 points vs.

year-ago).
