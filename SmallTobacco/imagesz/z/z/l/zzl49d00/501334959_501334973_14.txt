The fourth factor is best described as the "conservative man."

Herberger

No differences emerged on any of the adjectives within this
factor between either of the WINSTON campaigns. The Marlboro
campaign, however, was seen to portray a smoker who was
conservative, while this adjective did not describe either of

the WINSTON campaigns.

This conservative imagery is consistent
with the fact that "in tune with the times" also is seen as not

applying to the Marlboro Cowboy. Pérhaps this description

results from either the older models used in the Marlboro
campaign or from the traditional ideals associated with the

"taming of the West."
