was a good deal of perception that the Marlboro smoker would
"drive" a horse. On the other hand, the predominate portion
of respondents to the Candid campaign felt that the typical
WINSTON smoker would drive a sports car or mid-size car. It
is our judgement that the off-the-road vehicle perception
depicted by the Northwoods Logger campaign is far superior
to the sports car/mid-size car perception in appealing to
WINSTON's young adult somewhat downscale WINSTON target

audience.

In summary it would appear that the pattern of communication
for the Northwoods Logger campaign is more on target in that
it is more single-mindingly oriented toward a masculine
smoker imagery. The fact that the pattern of communication
is similar to the Marlboro campaign lends credence to this
judgement. Even though the Northwoods Logger campaign is
somewhat lower in taste communication versus Candid, it does
appear to be superior in this regard to Marlboro, thus
maintaining the brand's taste heritage.
