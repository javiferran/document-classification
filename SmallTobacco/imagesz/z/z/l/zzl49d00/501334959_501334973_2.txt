They were next asked what ideas and impressions they gained
about the brand advertised. Finally, they were asked what
ideas were communicated about the product itself.

In responding to the first question on main idea communication
it is evident that the primary communication of the new WINSTON
campaign tends to be in the smoker imagery arena. The highest
points communicated were that WINSTON was for the "rugged
masculine type" and for the “outdoorsman." In addition, there
was further dimensionalization of the smoker imagery in play-
back of the point that WINSTON is for the “mature grown-up
smoker's taste" and for the "hard working man." There was
Little communication of taste and flavor benefits in answer to
this initial question on main idea communication.

The Candid campaign, on the other hand, does not communicate
smoker imagery as well as the Northwoods Logger campaign.
Additionally, it does not appear to he as single-minded in .
its communication. That is, an almost equal portion of
respondents played back the taste benefit of "good taste/

flavor" and the image benefit of for the "rugged masculine type.”
/

Finally, the pattern of communication for the Marlboro campaign
is quite similar to that of the Northwoods Logger campaign in
that it very single-mindedly communicates smoker imagery with
little communication of taste benefits.
