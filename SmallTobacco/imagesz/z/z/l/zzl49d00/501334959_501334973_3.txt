Although the pattern of communication for the three campaigns
after the response on all three questions on open-end communi-
cation were coded together is quite similar to that noted
above for only the main point communication one difference
does emerge. Even though main idea communication of taste is
minimal for the Northwoods Logger campaign, further probing
reveals a latent reservior of taste’ benefit communication
inherent in the Northwoods Logger campaign - higher than is
inherent in the Marlboro campaign. Indeed, a review of total
taste message playback from the new WINSTON campaign reveals
that approximately .85 taste messages were played back by the
average Northwoods Logger respondent. In fact, the taste
message playback for the Northwoods Logger campaign is only
marginally below that of the Candid campaign.

Moreover, as noted previously, the new WINSTON campaign far
exceeds the Candid campaign in smoker imagery communication
(1.8 smoker imagery messages played back by the average
Northwoods Logger respondent versus 1.1 smoker imagery messages
for the average Candid respondent).
