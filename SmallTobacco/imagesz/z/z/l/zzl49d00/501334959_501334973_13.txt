The third factor has to do with the smokers relationship
to himself. With the exception of "attractive" no major
differences between the campaigns emerged on any of the
adjectives within this factor. "Attractive" was seen as

the Northwoods Logger or the Marlboro Cowboy. While
"attractive" tended to describe the Marlboro Cowboy, it
did so at a significantly lower level than either of the
two WINSTON campaigns.
