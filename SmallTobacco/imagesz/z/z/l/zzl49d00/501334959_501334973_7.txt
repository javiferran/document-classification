advertising. Finally, it is our judgement that the most
desirable personality type for the WINSTON personality image
is that of an active, independent, practical person.

In reviewing the personality typology attributed to the WINSTON
models in the Northwoods Logger campaign, it is clear that
consumers can agree that the logger is an active, independent,

practical personality type (personality type VII).

Significantly

more respondents felt that the WINSTON logger was a type VII

personality than any other personality type.

The next most prevelant personality attributed to the new WINSTON

campaign was the type VIII personality. That is,

the smoker was

seen as an active, independent, but idealistic personality type.
Thus, respondents did perceive the Northwoods Logger campaign
as being highly defined - primarily as a type VII personality
(active, independent, practical) and secondarily as a type VIII

personality (active, independent, idealistic).
