~2- Philip Morris USA CONFIDENTIAL

whom the ‘*Superjuice’’ components were identified, but a 1969 Frank Daylor note informed col-
leagues that IITRI odor characterization devices were being made available to sponsors for $1600
[C69-04299}; I cannot say for certain whether such a purchase was made for in-house flavor research,
but it seems likely. Nevertheless, flavor formulation began in earnest in late 1974 — evidenced partly
by requests for toxicity searches —- and resulted in the national launch of Merit without ever having
gone through test market.

Finally it is worth noting to what lengths the company went to be competitive. First, patent protection
of ‘‘flavor enrichment’’ was rejected in favor of protection as a trade secret with the possible added
protection of a composition of matter patent on one compound used in the Merit flavor mix [C75-
03832]. Then, when Philip Morris got word that R. J. Reynolds was planning to launch its Now
brand, the date for the press conference heralding Merit was pushed up [C75-03769]. Also, there is a
very interesting 1971 memo from H. Hartung to D. Lowitz regarding work being started by J. S.
Osborne on sparging off volatile constituents of tobacco —~ as opposed to the smoke research of the
Flavor group —~ to separate and identify key flavor contributors to accomplish a similar flavor enrich-
ment effect as ultimately employed in Merit [(C71-06200]. It seems Hartung was of the impression that
R&D was not terribly effective in maintaining strict secrecy, and so since this proposal seemed very
promising and of such great potential competitive advantage, Hartung suggested taking extra special
precautions to maintain confidentiality.
