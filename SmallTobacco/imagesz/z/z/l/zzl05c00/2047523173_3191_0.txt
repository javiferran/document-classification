SUBJECT: Marlboro Alternate Volume Profiles

The attached tables seek to identify the non-Marlboro subgroups who contribute more
than their fair share to Marlboro volume on an alternate basis (Inflow), as well as the
Marlboro subgroups who contribute more than their fair share to competitive brands
on an alternate basis (Outflow). The objective is to provide insights into the geo-
demographic groups that are critical to the Marlboro franchise in determining key
offensive and defensive strategic initiatives.
