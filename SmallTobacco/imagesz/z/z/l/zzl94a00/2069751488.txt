Subject: Draft submission by Hong Kong Tobacco Institute on Hong Kong [AQ Guidance Notes.

Dear Matthias, Pete,

Attached please find the first draft of the above document by the HKTI. | have a number of issues with it in its present
form as | am not sure the comments from Matthias, Gary and myself are fully factored in. To speed up the review
process, | am sending you the document for review while | work on it myself. If we cannot get a satisfactory
consensus with the HKTI, we may have to make our own submission separate from them. Jenny Fung has asked me
to turn the piece around as soon as possible so | am afraid it's the same mad rush story again.

Raymond
