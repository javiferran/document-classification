Re: Case #2581

Dear Dr. Harrelson:

Your recent inquiry concerning support by this Council of a proposed
research project has now been considered by the Executive Committee of the
Scientific Advisory Board.

The Committee expressed interest in examining a more detailed plan of the
proposed investigations. I take pleasure in enclosing the necessary forms and
relevant literature pertaining to the filing of a formal application. The deadline for
submitting proposals is May 31, but because of the short time involved, we will
accept materials postmarked on or before June 9, 1989.

You understand, of course, that no commitment is implied at this time
concerning the final action of our full Scientific Advisory Board on the complete

proposal.
Sincerely yours,
TWh Mm Ade
