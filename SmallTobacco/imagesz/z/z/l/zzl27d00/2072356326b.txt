Now that | re-read Anita's note, I'm confused. She initially told me the letter would not go to the
networks unless they asked for additional back up. Now it seems the letter will be part of the initial
submission.

Perhaps we can have a call with Claire and discuss what other substantiation they are submitting to
the networks for the other ads and whether it's on PM letterhead addressed to LBC or the networks.
