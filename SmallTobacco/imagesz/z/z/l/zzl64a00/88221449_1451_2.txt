TEST ARTICLE PREPARATION

Appropriate: quantiities of Al3 were. mixed with normal saline (0.9%
NaCl) to achieve the correct dose levels. The concentration of Al3
in the mixture was adjusted for each dase Tevel so that the volume adinin-
istered per unit body weight was. 10 ml/kg during the study. All mixtures
were thoroughly agitated just prior to andi continually during) dosing.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN ~

All animals: were fasted overnight prior to dosing. Water was freely
available at all times. The test article was administeredi as: a single
oral dose by gavage to three groups. of two malie and two female rats at
dose levels of 1000,. 2000, and 3000 mg/kg.. The range of imitial body
weights. was 140 to 171 grams.

All animals: were observed for signs of toxicity and mortality at 1L,.
3, 6, and.24 hours after dosing and twice daily for the remainder of the
six-day observation period. Individual body weights were recorded prior

to: dosing. Ali] rats were: sacrificed and discarded after Day 6 of the
study.
RESULTS.

Mortal ity

No: deaths were observed at any dose level during the study.
Clinical Signs

No signs of compound induced toxicity were observed: im any of the
treatment: groups.

CONCLUSION

Based: on the results of this study, the maximum tolerated dose for

Al3: in the rat is estimated to be 3000 mg/kg.
