7 INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

To: - Dr. H. Wakeham bate: April 16, 1970
From: - William B. Cridlin, Jr.
Subject: . MEMBERSHIP - THE PTC RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF THE GEORGE

-WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY

I am well aware of this organization and can readily endorse
it mainly by its reputation. I, personally, have never
attended the PIC meetings, but those who have speak highly
of the work and objectives of this group. This Institute
investigates various problems in the field of intellectual
and industrial property and its association with the George
Washington University enhances the Institute's ability to
attract qualified persons to conduct the necessary studies
to fulfill its objectives,

The DuPont Company actively supports this endeavor and Samuel
Lenher, a DuPont vice president, is on its advisory council,
I am not certain which other companies support the Institute,
but I would imagine companies such as G.E., IBM, Monsanto,
etc., which have large patent programs are contributors. If
you would like a list of contributors, 1 believe I could get
one for you.

The work of this Institute is worthwhile and my recommendation
would be for Philip Morris to support the PTC Institute, I
would think the minimum amount of $500 to be a participating
member would be an adequate subscription.
