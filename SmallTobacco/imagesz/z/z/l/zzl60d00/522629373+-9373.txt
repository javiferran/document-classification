Amy -~ here are a few thoughts. If you would like more, I can do it. We are keeping very
quiet about the Ewing stuff. That’s why I made only a veiled reference to it.

The General Accounting Office is continuing its investigations of the FDA’s actions that
led up to its proposed tobacco regulation. The two investigations focus on the use of
appropriated money -- were funds redirected from congressionally mandated functions? --
and the internal process FDA used to come up with the regulations. FDA continues to
stonewall legitimate congressional requests for information, and faces the possibility of

additional actions.

ASSIST -- I would not add anything about it. It’s a big deal to the state folks, but
the money has already been given and our goal is to make sure that the program
does not continue once the current funding expires.

Appropriations: (1 would add something like this) RJR is working with congressional
offices to get a full accounting of exactly how much money and resources are being used
to regulate and control tobacco at the federal level. The intent is to highlight several
programs that are duplicative and work to zero out or reduce funding where possible.
