SUBJECT: Survey for Airborne Friable Materials in the Greensboro
Accounting Department . oe Cops

The discovery of suspect whitish particles on the desk of

Mr. Wayne Oakes led to an airborne survey of the office followed
by qualitative microscopic analysis of the filter membrane. A
personal sampling pump was calibrated with an in-line Millipore
AA 0.8 micron filter at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. An
eight-hour sample was taken on October 28, 1986 as per NIOSH ---
asbestos method B&CAM239. The absolute sensitivity of the method
was 0.1 fiber/cm” of gir. The present permissible exposure limit
(PEL) is 0.2 fiber/cm” of air. Upon completion of the survey,
the filter cassette was sealed, labelled and transferred to the
Analytical Development section for qualitative microscopic

- analysis.

A portion of the membrane filter was mounted and analyzed by an
ISI Super III Scanning Electron Microscope for the physical
appearance of the trapped particulates (1). No asbestiform
fibrous materials were found. Cellulosic paper particles, as
noted in Figures 1 and 2, and paper filler particles noted in
Figures 3 and 4 were the predominant species. These inert
materials, which are found in office environments, are considered . .
nuisance dusts and constitute no health hazard. . ,
