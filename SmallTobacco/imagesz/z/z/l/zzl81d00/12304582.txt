HOWARD HEWETT

With his current release of I Commit To Love, Howard
Hewett, the former lead singer of Shalamar, has fulfilled
a lifetime desire. He candidly commented, "Doing a solo
(album) has been a goal of mine for a long, long time.
Shalamar's last tour (with me) received reviews calling it
the ‘Howard Hewett Show' and now, it is."

Hewett joined Shalamar in 1979 and led the group
through a string of hit albums including: Big Fun, Three
For Love, Go For It and Friends. His last project with
Shalamar was Heartbreak, which included the hit single
“Dancin' In The Sheets" from the box office smash movie,
Footloose.

A native of Akron, Ohio, Hewett began his career as
part of the Hewett Singers, a gospel group that performed
with the likes of the Staple Singers and the Mighty Clouds
of Joy. However, his wish to expand his musical career
soon led Howard to various R&B bands in his hometown and,
finally, to Shalamar.

Now, aS a songwriter and singer, Hewett is embarking
on a new journey in his already illustrious musical career.
