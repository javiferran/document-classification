Cigarette Brand Shares - July 1980

July's Industry sales were off 4.3% versus 1979 (- 6.3% calendar
adjusted} due to a price increase last year. Likewise, reflecting the
price increase, year-to-date Industry figures were 1.1% below 1979
levels, and 1.4% behind when calendar adjusted. Year-to-date comparisons
through August are expected to be more representative of the Industry's
performance.

Philip Morris (30.9) recorded a slight decline for the month, as did
Brown & Willfamson (13.6). R.dJ. Reynolds (32.7), affected by the
combination of the discontinuation of Winston Menthol 100's, Salem Box,
Real and Tempo, and the national introduction of Salem Ultras, had

a smal] increase. American (10.7) and Lorillard (9.8) also gained some
Share. Liggett & Myers (2.3) remained unchanged.

Among the leading brands, Marlboro (17.7) retreated from last month's
high, Declines were also evident in Winston (13.2) and Kool (8.9),

Salem (9.1) enjoyed the largest increase due to the launch of Salem
Ultras (0.6). Other gainers included Merit (4.3), Kent (5.0) and Camel
(4.3). B&H 100's (4.4), Pall Mall (5.2) and Vantage (3.7) held steady.

The Low Tar category tar level groups (Chart 6) have been revised from
O-5mg. and 6-9mg., to O-6mq. and 7-9mg., respectively, to include Vantage
Ultra Lights (6mg.) and Salem Ultras (5mg. Kings, 6mq. 100's) in the
Ultra Low Tar category.

The Low Tar category (41.5) surged in July aided by new Salem Ultra.
Low Tar 80/85's (24.3), Low Tar 100/120's (17.3) and Menthol Low Tar (13.0)
all registered share increases. The Non-Menthol Low Tar category (28.6)

was unchanged. Among the recent new Low Tar entries, Cambridge and Now 100's

recorded .3 shares, and Carlton 100's Box had a .2 share.

Of the other major categories, Total Menthol (28.9) and Total 100's (31.8)
increased. Total 80/85's (58.1) declined slightly.
