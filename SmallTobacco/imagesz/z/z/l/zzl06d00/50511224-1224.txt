Fura-2 fluorescence in single rat basophilic leukemia
cells was monitored to study the rise in intracellular
free ionized calcium ([Ca*]) produced by aggregation
of immunoglobulin E receptors. Repetitive transient
increases in (Ca**],; were induced by antigen stimula-
tion and were measured using digital video imaging
microscopy at high time resolution. The {Ca?*], oseil-
lations were not dependent upon changes in the mem-
brane potential of the cells and were observed in cells
stimulated with antigen either with or without extra-
cellular Ca?*. Transient oscillations in [Ca?*], were also
observed when calcium influx was blocked with La®*.
These results suggested that during antigen stimula-
tion of cells under normal physiological conditions,
release of Ca** from intracellular stores makes an im-
portant contribution to the initial increase in [Ca?*},,
Oscillations in [Ca?*]; are not induced by elevating
[Ca’*], with the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Mito-
chondrial calcium buffering is not required for [Ca?*],
oscillations to occur. The results show that rat baso-
philic leukemia cells have significant stores of calcium
and that release of calcium from these stores can par-
ticipate in both the initial rise and the oscillations in
[Ca**],.

Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)' cells are a tumor mast cell
line that responds to stimuli that aggregate surface receptors
for immunoglobulin E (IgE), generating a large rise in intra-
cellular free ionized calcium ((Ca”*],) and ultimately resulting
in secretion of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity. It
has long been known that Ca** plays a critical role in the
initiation and control of secretory behavior in many different
eee

cell types. Furthermore, studies in mast cells using Ca’*
ionophores have established a causal relationship between the
increase in [Ca**], and secretion (1, 2). Changes in (Ca?*], in
RBL cells have largely been attributed to the influx of Ca2*
from the extracellular medium (3-6). However, the involve-
ment of releasable calcium stores in the control of cellular
processes has been documented in many cell types, and cal-
cium stores have recently been implicated in the generation
of elevated [Ca’*}, in RBL cells? (5, 7, 8). Indeed, stores are
sufficient to supply enough calcium to support much of the
early phase of the rise in [Ca], in these cells (5).

Digital video imaging of fluorescent indicators has been
used to study changes in [Ca**], in a number of different cell
types (9-18) including RBL cells (19). Current studies by us
and by others have shown remarkable differences between the
measurements of [Ca’*], in populations of cells and those
obtained from the individual cells that comprise the popula-
tion. In our early work (19), the [Ca?*]; responses of individual
RBL cells stimulated by cross-linking surface IgE receptors
were found to be preceded by lag times of variable length;
once initiated, the rise in [Ca’*]; was much more rapid than
might be predicted from fluorometric studies with cell suspen-
sions. It has been observed that [Ca’*], in different types of
cells stimulated with a variety of agonists fluctuates markedly
(20), sometimes in concert with repetitive spiking of the
membrane potential (21-24). Because of technical restrictions
frequently associated with digital video microscopy, high time
resolution measurements of [Ca’*]; have often been carried
out using one cell at a time. Significant improvement of the
temporal resolution of [Ca]; imaging measurements has
allowed us to record simuitaneously the marked, frequently
oscillating increases of [Ca’*], in many stimulated RBL cells.

In this study, we have begun to characterize the (Ca?*];
oscillations, to identify their source, and to determine what
cellular components are involved in their control. We have
found that oscillations in [Ca’*‘]; can still occur when the
membrane potential is clamped and do not require calcium
influx from the extracellular solution. The [Ca?"], oscillations
appear to occur as the result of modulation of [Ca**]; by
exchange with intracellular stores.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell Preparation—Rat basophilic leukemia cells of the secreting
subline 2H3 (25) were cultured as described previously (26). Cells
were removed from flasks by treatment with trypsin-EDTA (GIBCO)
in a calcium- and magnesium-free saline solution. Sensitization by
incubation with a monoclonal IgE directed against the dinitrophenyl
hapten was carried out in Eagle's minimal essential medium (GIBCO)
supplemented with 10 mM Na-HEPES and 20% newborn bovine
serum (GIBCO). RBL cells were suspended at. 10° cells/ml in a
buffered saline solution which, for most experiments, contained 135
