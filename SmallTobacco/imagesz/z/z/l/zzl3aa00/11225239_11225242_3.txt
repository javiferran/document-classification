allow survival of the larynx beyond the life-span of the originally exposed
animal.

A paper by Dr. Homburger for presentation at the March meeting of the
Society of Toxicology was extensively rewritten by Dr. Hockett and

Mr. Jacob who insisted that in addition a statement be inserted that
"opinions expressed by the author are not necessarily those of the
sponsor" (March 20, 1973).

On April 23, 1973, support for the study of the usefulness of the golden
hamster for smoke inhalation was extended for four months.

On December 3, 1973 an abstract was submitted to Dr. Hockett of a
paper to be given at the FASEB meeting in April 1974 on data from the
final report on this project.

A complete final report was submitted to the CTR on our inhalation studies
concluding that the Syrian hamster was suitable for studies of the effects
of cigarette smoking on the epithelium of the larynx and for studies of
such effects upon certain lung parameters.

A few days ago we were advised that the CTR decided not to continue the
studies on smoke inhalation in inbred hamsters.
