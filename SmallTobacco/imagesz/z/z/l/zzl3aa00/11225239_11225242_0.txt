Chronology of Events

On December 4, 1964, The Council for Tobacco Research initiated an
expetiment on the effects of chronic exposure to tobacco smoke of
populations of mice of various strains, to explore the effect of tobacco
smoke when applied directly to the skin of mice as well as to various
other organs of other species such as rabbits, rats or hamsters. It also
was to support design and construction of a smoking machine. This was
financed by a grant of $350,000 in five equal annual installments of
$70,000 each to Bio-Research Institute, Inc.

A first smoking machine was designed and constructed by Richard Walton
and began to be tested by us on December 2, 1965. Exploratory studies
with various modifications of the Walton machine continued to January
1967 when the first group of 100 C57BL/6 mice were subjected to chronic
inhalation studies. These were replaced by 200 Millerton Swiss mice in
May 1967 because of high mortality among the black mice. A great deal
of work was done on acute toxicity of smoke of various cigarettes in mice
and a paper was published on this at a meeting of the Society of Toxicology
in 1967. ee

On November 1, 1967, a patent application for the smoking machine was
filed by Richard Walton. On October 1, 1968, we suggested that ''the
time had come to decide whether or not the Walton reverse smoker should
be universally accepted."' We stated that, based on our experience, we
were ready to begin a new chronic exposure experiment. This was based
on a review of data on 34 surviving mice exposed five times per week for
55 weeks. Slides of these mice were reviewed by Loosli who called them
poor and by Thelma Dunn and Harold Stewart who commented that "the
dilatation of the alveolar spaces appears to be excellent, so we judge that
your technique for expanding the lungs by the intratracheal instillation of
fixing fluid is satisfactory. "'

From 1968 to 1969 the first large-scale experiment for skin painting with
native smoking machine jet condensate was carried out and the lesser
activity of fresh smoke was first noted by Bernfeld September 5, 1969.

On November 7, 1969 the use of inbred Syrian hamsters was first sug-
gested by us as part of a study of the effects of rodent viruses on tobacco
smoke effects then proposed by Dr. Sim of Yale who wished to join us for
this work. CTR declined to support this project.
