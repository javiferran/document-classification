On February 26, 1970, two smoking machines were given Mason Research
Institute for evaluation.

On July 31, 1970, a renewal agreement was signed to cover the period
from June 1, 1972 to May 31, 1973 for studies to determine the useful-
ness of the golden Syrian hamster as model animal for inhalation studies.
All the objectives of this study (except for gas phase inhalation) have
since been met.

On September 10, 1970, differences in nicotine toxicity (by intraperitoneal
route) between hamster lines were reported. Also hamsters were found
far less susceptible to nicotine than either mice or rats (all by the i. p.
route).

In August 1970 (letter of Dr. Hockett, August 11, 1970) concern was
expressed by the Advisory Board regarding the positive findings in our
hamster sera for Sendai virus antibodies. Dr. Frank Rauscher wrote
September 10, 1970, commenting on these antibodies: 'For long term
carcinogenesis studies it is reasonable to assume that these two viruses
(Sendai and M adenovirus) should not cause problems unless new evidence
is uncovered to the contrary."

[On October 12, 1973, we obtained a report on a study initiated by Sam
Poiley of NIH with IIT Research Institute concluding that no antibody was
present in our hamster sera against Sendai virus and that 'false reactions
were probably seen because of antibody against the sheep cells, not any
particular antigen.'' Thus the serious concern about virus infections that
influenced Council decisions since 1970 proved to have no scientific basis. ]

In September 1970 we were first made aware of a new modification of the
Walton machine engineered by the Council for Tobacco Research and
commented September 9 that we did not consider this modification to be
workable. We cited four major drawbacks of the machine. In March
1971 Dr. Guerin of Oak Ridge National Laboratories visited our labora-
tories and was shown our smoking machine technology.

On April 14, 1971, a report was made on nicotine (is p. ) toxicity in ham-
sters and on the effects of whole smoke at a 19.2% concentration upon
several inbred lines of hamsters. The outline of an 18-month study
aiming at 40 to 50 surviving hamsters in each group was submitted.
Provisions were included for monitoring the CO level in blood and data
were given on such levels during smoke inhalation. In August 1971 it was
decided to carry out this study in its entirety with our own smoking
machine, not using the Council's horizontal modification. On October 8,
