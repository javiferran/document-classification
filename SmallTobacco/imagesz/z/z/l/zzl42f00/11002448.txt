RE: Aughenbaugh v. Roberts, Supreme Court #5836843
Initiative Petition regarding alcohol tax increases

Dear Chief Justice Peterson:

I have been notified that the initiative petition referenced above
contains an insignficant error in ORS citation.

As the chief petitioner, I want to make it clear that this error in
no way affects the ability of petitioners or signers to understand
the initiative.

Ynerefore, I will not be withdrawing this initiative.

Thank you for your time as you consider the technicalities of the

Attorney General’s title. Unfortunately, I fear that there will be
further frivolous litigation by those who value strategy ovar

ard to the Court’s timely response on the title question.
