2. Modify the pentane batch unit to include steam jet evacuation,
hot tank, and cold tank.

Memorandum:

Tests were run to evaluate the use of pentane as an alternate
puffing agent for the G-13, This report includes test data and results
for comparison of untreated G-13A, production (FC-11) G-13A, pentane batch
G-13A, and porous belt G-13A, both as total composition, and blended into
the WINSTON LIGHT 84. The report also discusses the feasibility of using ‘
pentane as an alternate puffing agent, with particular emphasis on the
pentane batch process.

I. Test Evaluation

A. Test Preparation | .

G-13A feed and product before top dressing were procured from
No. 601 Processing. The feed was dried to 12.7 percent moisture, One
portion of the dried feed was used for pentane batch processing, another
portion was supplied to Mr. Jack White, Research Department, for pentane
porous belt processing, and a third portion was used for evaluation.

The portion processed through the pentane batch unit was Lot G-13
P-37, run April 5, 1979. Three baskets, each holding 125 pounds, were
evacuated to four mm. Hg. abs., pressurized to 65 psia. with pentane vapor,
held for sixty minutes without venting, vented to 20 psia. steamed for four
minutes, fifteen seconds, evacuated to 13 mm. Hg. abs., and vented to
atmospheric pressure over a twenty-three minute period. Total cycle time
was 120 minutes. No heat shield was used during the run. During the one
hour impregnation time, the chamber pressure increased from 65 to 90 psia.,
and the tobacco temperature increased from 185°F, to 210°F. During the
steaming cycle, the tobacco temperature reached 244°F. Composite samples
taken before and after processing indicated feed filling capacity of 388
and product filling capacity of 691 for 78 percent increase.

 

The tobacco for the porous belt was moistened, pentane vapor impregnated
at atmospheric pressure for at least three days, and steamed 3-5 seconds on
the porous belt,

The three expanded samples (FC-11, pentane batch, and pentane porous
belt) were top dressed with F-47, as described in L-13,155 Tobacco Product
Test Information, Appendix A-l. Unfiltered cigarettes were made from the
unpuffed feed and from these three samples. Physical, chemical, smoke,
expert smoking panel and essential oils evaluations were obtained from the
cigarettes. Results appear in Appendix A-2 thru A~-6,

Tobacco from each of these four lots was used as the G~13A portion in
WINSTON LIGHT 84 blends. ‘These blends are described in L-13,156 Tobacco
Product Test Information, Appendix B-1. Cigarettes were made from these blends.
