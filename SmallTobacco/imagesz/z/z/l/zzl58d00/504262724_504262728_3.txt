5, Smoking Panel Evaluations

The expert panel evaluation of 100 percent G-13A cigarettes
found that the pentane belt had significantly better aroma and directionally
more nicotine effect than the FC-11 product. They found the batch product
directionally stronger and more stemmy tasting than the belt product. They
found no difference between the FC-11 and pentane batch products.

Booth panel testing showed no significant difference between
WINSTON LIGHT 84 containing the three expanded products. Exmplyee U.S.
Mail panel results showed no clear pattern of superiority for any product.
For example, when comparing after taste in WINSTON LIGHT: 84, it rated the
belt product very significantly better than the batch product, the FC-11
product directional better than the belt, and no difference between the
FC~11 and batch products. One would anticipate after the first two findings
that the FC-11 product would be rated superior to the batch product.

II, G-13 Pentane Batch Processor
The pentane batch processor was operated to obtain product for evaluation

of pentane as an alternate puffing agent, and to obtain operating parameters
for a pentane batch processor.
