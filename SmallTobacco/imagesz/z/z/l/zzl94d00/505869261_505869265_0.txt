RETAINED SOLVENTS

¢ How does the preliminary specification of .5@ mg. toluene/CPB and 1.48 mg.
total solvent/CPB effect SPA products? Is this specification feasible to

produce?
RESULTS:
# Retained solvent levels in Alpha CPB‘s:

Full Print 1/3 Print Spec.
(mo, /CPB) (mo,/CPB)  <(mo./CPB)

Isopropyl] Acetate 1.86 271 --
Isopropyl] Alcohol 1.05 ~52 --
n-Propyl Acetate 86 29 --
Toluene 25 -@8 -58
TOTAL ; , 4.02 1.60 1.48

(CPB's at four days aging; analysis by Archer R&D)
Ink formulations for SPA crush-proof boxes is given in Attachment 1. These
formulations have been reviewed by toxicology and are acceptable.

CONCLUSTONS +

* Both one-third and full printed boxes meet toluene specifications.

* The one-third printed box is close to spec on total solvents, and can be
produced at current specifications.

* The full printed box is out of spec on total solvents, but probability is
high that levels can be reduced by the use of the vacuum chamber and/or aqueous
top lacquer. Archer R & D will conduct trials to determine effectiveness of
these methods in reducing total solvents in the full printed box by mid-

October.

# Future specifications will be based on total solvent levels.
