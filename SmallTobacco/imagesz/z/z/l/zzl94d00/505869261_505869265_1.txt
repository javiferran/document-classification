RETAINED SOLVENTS

ISSUE:

* Are solvents from printed package materials absorbed by Alpha products?
RESULTS:

= O-14 Toluene Study

* Toluene is absorbed into products from packaging materials

# Level of absorption by an Alpha product is 3 % of total toluene applied

to the crush~proof box

.example: @.5 mo toluene/CPB would transfer 15 ug to each product; entire

pack of twenty products would absorb 0.3 mg.)

* 99 % of toluene absorbed by the product migrates to the fuel source

«5S X% of absorbed toluene is delivered to mainstream aerosol (less than 1 %-
is in mainstream TPM) ‘

* Similar results were obtained in two earlier C-14 toluene studies

Headspace 6 -

* Method for determining solvents in Alpha fuel source will be completed by
July 31

* Preliminary results indicate only trace amounts of solvent found in the fuel
source

CONCLUSIONS:

¢ Both studies found toluene/solvents were absorbed by SPA products, but
only in trace amounts
