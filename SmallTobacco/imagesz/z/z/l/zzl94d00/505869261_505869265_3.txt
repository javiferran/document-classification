OVERALL SUMMARY

# Only one-third printed box is within specification for total solvents

* By both C-14 toluene and headspace 6C, only trace amounts of solvents are
absorbed in Alpha products

* Sensory discriminant analysis resulted in mo significant difference between
control and products packed in 1/3 printed and full printed boxes

RECOMMENDATION:
# For both 1/3 printed and full printed boxes:

- Specification should be maintained at .5 mp. toluene/CPB and 1.48 mg. total
solvents/CPB

NEXT STEPS:
* To reduce solvent levels
â€˜= Use aqueous lacquer (reduction of 66 X% solvents)

~- Use vacuum chamber (reduction of 25 % solvents: additional cost of
$2@.006/CPB)

~ Lenothen aging time (will likely not reduce solvents enough?

~ Re-desion drying system (not feasible within project time frame)
