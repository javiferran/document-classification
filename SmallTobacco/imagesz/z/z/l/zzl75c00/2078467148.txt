Subject: COMPETITIVE ACTIVITIES REPORT-wks. ending 10-22-99 + 11-05-99

Importance: â€” High

Enclosed is the Competitive Activities Report for weeks ending October 22, 1999
and November 11, 1999. This report is longer than usual due to the
extraordinary amount of competitive activity over the past five weeks.

As noted with the previous issue, this is now a monthly report, but it contains
information compiled from the responses to two bi-weekly sets of questions sent
to the Field Sales Force, National Accounts Managers, Trade Marketing National
Accounts Managers, and Region Analysts.

This report was prepared on a MAC with every possible care taken to ensure
readability by both MAC and p.c. users.
