Sampling, according to David Henneberry of TILK Direct,.is
"the most effective way of marketing, and hotel sampling
may well be the way of the future for tobacco companies,
as the public attitude of militant non-smokers dictates
city councils into forbidding the random sampling done on
street.corners." (Quote from an article in NY Times.)

Although R.J. Reynolds' promotional programs will be taking

a new direction in 1988, I feel very strongly that a program

as successful as this one has been should be given further
consideration. It has demonstrated to he the most effective
form of marketing because it is cost efficient and targeted to
the affluent audience in the most important market in the world.

With the hotel sampling in place we are able to sample special
events and functions that RJR feels strongly about. This’ includes
sporting events to which RJR buys blocks of tickets and entertains

chain store buyers and other clients.

I am writing to ask that you reconsider the cancellation of this
program and for a quick reply since the network of relationships
I have cultivated with hotels and clubs could wither away quickly
through inactivity. I would hate to see a competitor move in and
reap the benefits of all the time and effort we have put into this

unique program.

Sincerely,
