Dear Mr. Dean:

For the past seven years I have run a successful sampling
program for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company aimed at up-scale
adult audiences in Manhattan and Long Islands' finest hotels
and clubs.

I was informed today that the hotel sampling program will not
be continued for 1988 and was concerned that perhaps it was
mistakenly included when programs which could be criticized
for possible exposure to teenagers were eliminated. There
have been recent competitive developments which lead me to
believe the competition is increasing their emphasis on New
York hotel sampling. And the painful truth is that should

we drop our affiliation with these hotels it may be impossible
to regain them should Reynolds' change its direction in the
future. This hotel sampling program would be an ideal vehicle
for the launch of the new smokeless cigarette we plan for 1988.

The best reason for keeping the program is the cost. This year

we will distribute 750,000 sample packs at a total cost of $153,900
or nineteen-cents a pack, not including the cost of product.

This successful promotion in the most coveted of marketplaces

has far-reaching sales potential.

Our major competitor in the hotel sampling program is Philip Morris
who has held this program on-line since 1970. We consistently run
into their samplers at a number of properties that we sample, as
Philip Morris has involvement with a number of affiliations here

in this important market. Indeed we have held a preemptive position
versus the competition because we sample seven days a week.

Yesterday, for the first time, we encountered Lorillard at the
Sheraton-Center Hotel sampling "Newports" at the International
Hospitality Ball.
