4. RMMM, in concert with Regional Sales Manager and the
advertising agency/promotional supplier, will identify
lifestyle interest/field marketing opportunities to
fully exploit smoker sub-segments. ‘

Next Steps

1. In order to gain additional knowledge, identify and meet
with RJRT direct-buying customers who have experience |
executing a Micro Marketing approach relative to other
product lines they sell. Seek additional learning from
beverage and fast-food companies who currently execute
local or Micro Marketing programs; i.e., Coke, Hardies,
etc.

2. Form a multi-disciplined task force comprised of Sales
and Marketing personnel to guide the development of
RIRT’s Micro Marketing Program.

3. Determine the internal support function requirements and
restructure organization accordingly. Extensive time
will be required from an internal support group
perspective to service the development and production
needs of the 32 Micro Marketing Regions.

4. Develop a comprehensive training program for Field Sales
(top down--all levels) which will provide Field Sales
with the expertise to fully exploit local Micro
Marketing opportunities.

5. Three months prior to phased in regional expansions,
begin recruiting and training individuals to staff the
RMMM position as well as orientating the affected
Regional Sales Managers to the marketing discipline.

6. Develop an operational manual which includes the "Do’s _
and Don’ts" of Micro Marketing as well as guidelines for
program development. The manual will be inclusive of a
variety of modular promotions which can be expediently
developed and tailored to .a specific market opportunity.

7. Based on learning from the Atlanta/Cincinnati lead

markets, determine the reporting hierarchy relative to
Sales or Marketing or a separate operational unit.
