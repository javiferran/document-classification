Cancer May Have
Multiple Causes,
Says TIRC’s Hockett

New Yorke, Nov. 26—An abun-
dance of evidence is accumulating
that shows lung cancer cennot be
explained by any single, simple
factor, such as cigaret smoking, Dr.
Robert C. Hockett, associate sci-
entific director of the Tobacco In-
dustry Research Committee, told
the New York City Advertising
Men’s Post 209 of the American
Legion last week.

“A care is sometimes made for
the anti-clgarct theory by selecting
the evidence,” Dr. Hockett said.
“JLikewlse, a case against this the-
ory can also be made by selecting
the evidence.

“But taking all the known face
tors in balance, one must arrive
ct the conclusion that the answer
or answers to human Jung cancer
just aren’t known. Anyone may
speculate on hie oct theory, hit
such opinions should not be con-
fused witn racts."

Describing the work of the scl-
entific advisory board of the To-
bacco Industry Research Commit-
tee, Dr. Hockett said that the board
of nine independent scientists has
compiete freedom in the research
policy and program, and has al-
located about $2,000,000 so far in
grants to scientists working in ed-
ucctional, medical and research in-
stitutions.

@ The position of the board, he
said, is that so far too Little is
known about lung cancer and
heart disease to warrant any con-
clusions as to specific cause or
causes.

“Factors statistically associated
with lung cancer do not necessari-
ly have a causative role,” Dr.
Hockett said. “The significance of
the more recent studies is that they
show lung cancer is related to a
vast number of factors.

“It is certainly not justified tc
assign to any one of them a pri-
mary causative role, especially
when medical science is just be-
ginning to lift the curtain on thi
unknowns about cancer.”

Emphasizing that getieralization:
about the effects of smoking on
health are unwarranted, Dr. Hock-
ett cited a scientific paper giver
last week at the Southern Medica’
Assn. meeting (AA, Nov. 1%) A
study of 11,000 workers of Amer:

fean Tobacce Co. showed that thr
workers smoke nearly ¢wir- i
much a> the average smoker abc
sty have average or below aver-
age cancer and heart diserse risk:
and live beyond the average lift
expectancy.

a “If nothing else," Dr. Hocket:
said, “this shows that smoking, ir
itself isn't necessarily or invaria-
bly associated with higher dest!
rates or higher risks of cancer anc
heart disease.” 2
