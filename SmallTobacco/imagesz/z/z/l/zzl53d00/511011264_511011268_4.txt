Sister Chromatid Exchange (SCE) - Slides prepared of CSC
treatments were scored for SCE. The results shown below

indicate positive response of SCE assay to CSC.

Treatment SCE/Metaphase
Untreated Central 10.5
DMSO Control 12.2
Cyclophosphamide (1 yg/ml1) 21.1
CSC 50 ye/ml 15.5
csc 100 ye/ml 20.0
CSC 150 pg/ml 21.4
CSC 200 pg/ml 25.1

Water Quality - Three samples were processed this week bring-
ing the total to 97 samples. The sample load will be
increased beginning Monday, June 24, 1985, to screen RJR
Archer sites.

Inhalation Toxicology - Drs. Paul Ayres and deBethizy had
informative discussions with Drs. Charlie Green and Brad

Ingebrethsen concerning the physical and chemical properties
of tobacco smoke aerosol. Future collaborative arrangements
with Fundamental R&D should provide to be rewarding for both
departments.

Dr. Ayres contacted vendors about availability of aerosol
sampling instruments which he and Dr. Chris Coggins will use
to characterize tobacco smoke aerosols.

Biochemical Toxicology - Don deBethizy and Sam Simmons dis-
cussed the Vessell nicotine proposal with Dr. Bill Waddell, a
member of the SAB. Dr. Waddell agreed that it was important
to examine th metabolism of nicotine in smokers vs. non-
smokers in well-controlled studies.

Biobehavioral Research

Nicotine Receptor Pharmacology - The abilities of four
antagonists for peripheral nicotinic cholinergic receptors to
block the binding of nicotine to rat brain membrane prepara-
tions were studied. The concentrations which inhibited the
binding of 30 nM nicotine by 50% (IC50) are shown below.
These data suggest that these antagonists were relatively
ineffective in blocking nicotine binding.

Antagonist IC50 (uM)
Decamethonium 50
Tubocurarine 200
Hexamethonium 1000
Alpha bungarotoxin >1000
