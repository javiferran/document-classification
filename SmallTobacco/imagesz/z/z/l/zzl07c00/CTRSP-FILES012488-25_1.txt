4. Have there been changes in the rate with which young people start or stop
smoking and if so, are such changes related to occupational choice?

5. Are there occupational differences in the way the smoking behavior of a
subpopulation changes as it grows older?

6. How do smoking habits differ between employed and unemployed individuals?

7. Has publicity about smoking had an effect on the accuracy of occupationally
related smoking data obtained by interview methods?

By combining data on the distribution of smoking habits by occupation, industry,
sex, and race, obtained from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) of 1970
and that of 1979/80 [USDHEW, 1974], we can obtain answers to these questions.

METHODS

The NHIS collects information on a continuing nationwide sample of households
as part of the ongoing activity of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).
The data collected in these surveys are made available to investigators on Public Use

‘Tapes obtainable through the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). Both in

1970 and 1979/80, the NHIS utilized questionnaires that requested from respondents,
among other information, a detailed description of smoking habits, as well as infor-
mation on the nature of respondents’ employment status and, for those who had been
employed, the occupation and industry in which they worked. The surveys were
conducted by interviewing, each week, a sample of households selected from the
civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population, using a sophisticated stratified proba-
bility sampling technique in such a way that each weekly sample of households is
representative of the target population, and that weekly samples are additive over
time. Associated with each individual is a weighting factor, which is basically the
reciprocal of the probability of that individual's being selected. In 1970, all subjects
aged 17 or over were asked detailed questions about their smoking behavior, and the
resultant data were part of the regular Public Use Tapes. In 1979, a randomly chosen
one-third subsample of those 17 and over were asked somewhat less detailed questions
about smoking, and in 1980, the fraction was one sixth; in both of these years
smoking information was distributed separately as a so-called Smoking Supplement
Tape. For the 1979 and 1980 surveys, NHIS has adjusted the weights within the
Smoking Supplement Sample so that in each year estimates can be made that apply to
the whole population. (A detailed description of the design of the survey and general
qualifications of the data obtained from it may be found in USDHEW, 1974.)

For 1970, NHIS data were available on 116,466 individuals. Smoking informa-
tion was obtained only from individuals who were 17 years of age or older. We did
not include subjects of races other than white or black in our analy “>, since there
were too few of them (749) to permit meaningful comr-risons. “uso, about 50
subjects with invalid occupational coding were dropped. Tu.ve wer. /5,497 subjects
from the 1970 survey available for analysis.

Combining the one-third sample from 1979 with the one-sixth sample from 1980
yields a group of 37,604 individuals, which is just under half the number of observa-
tions available for 1970. After excluding individuals of other races and those with
invalid data, 34,800 subjects from the 1979/80 surveys remained for analysis.

Occupations are encoded on the NHIS tapes using the Classified Index of
Occupations and Industries (Bureau of the Census, 1960, 1970]. The 1970 data used
