Changes in Smoking Characteristics by Type of
Employment From 1970 to 1979/80
[cre “yor,

James J. Weinkam, osc, and Theodor D. Sterling, PhD

 

Changes in the distribution of smoking status between and within occupations by sex,
race, and age are examined for 1970 and 1979/80, 10 years that saw rapid changes in
smoking prevalence. The pattern of occupation within smoking categories remains
basically unchanged, and, in fact, becomes more pronounced among males. The proba-
bility of young people taking up smoking remains tied to eventual occupational choice.
The decline in smoking prevalence is larger among the employed than among those who

are not employed. There has been a substantial increase in refusals to answer questions
about smoking.

Key words: occupation, smoking prevalence, smoking decline

 

INTRODUCTION

There have been a number of reports on prevalence of smoking by occupation,
based largely on data collected prior ta 1971 [Sterling and Weinkam, 1976, 1978;
Covey and Wynder, 1981; Blair et al, 1985]. However, profound changes have taken
place since then that may have affected both the mix of occupations and the prevalence
of smoking of the U.S. population. Widespread introduction of new technology may
have operated to lessen the importance of certain service jobs and to increase
technical, professional, and clerical employment. These same factors may also have
contributed to a shift in racial differences in occupation. Housewives have entered or
reentered the labor force in increasing numbers. At the same time, there appears to
have been an overall decline in the prevalence of smoking.

Changes in smoking prevalence oyer time raise a number of questions of
importance to occupational health investigations:

1. Have ‘here been changes in the occupational differences in smoking
prevalence?

2. Have there been changes in the distribution of occupations within various
smoking categories?

3. Are such changes similar for females and males, for blacks and whites?
