8A21 Paper Technology Support:

Mike Peters participated in the Marlboro standardization effort and attended the
follow-up meetings.

The 8-port instrument was used to smoke production Superslims and additional
commercial brands in order to bulld up our database for commercial brands other than
Mariboro Lights 100. It is possible that a decision will be made to use a different brand
for calculating sidestream reduction either domestically or for the Japanese market, and
smoking of several brands will continue. The Superslims from October QA pickups
were quite variable (68-78 % reduction). During this work the lighter bar caused a
problem, which was corrected by Freddie Ford by replacing a spring and heater cecil.

QSE alerted us to a set of sample cards for Grade 629 (Superslims) with paper
strips without verge lines. Discussed the situation with Maryann Stanton, who looked
into how many pallets had been shipped with the questionable bobbin identifications

and subsequently put two pallets on hold.

Reviewed a patent by Schoeller & Hoesch on battoning of cigarette paper. It
appeared that we might have difficulties pursuing our patent application on calendering
with this “prior art”.

Met with Ty Newby for the Cigarette Storage Gl Team. He described how the
database captures information from Semiworks and options for fine tuning the use of

the system. Some minor modifications were agreed upon, and the full team will look at
the final product to evaluate any additional changes that may be desirable.
