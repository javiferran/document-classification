6A11 Prod, Launch - Japan (IPPS):

Attended a meeting to plan the next steps for moving into production of Virginia
Slims Special Lights, and to prepare for Danchi testing of menthol prototypes.

Discussed incoming material testing for paper composition with QSE personnel,
who will look into potential differences in analytical methodology (CaCO3 and MKP by
X-ray) between the 43g/m? and the current Superslims production 53 g/m? paper.

Sue Tafur and | also met with QSE personnel to discuss conventional QA
testing of shipments of low sidestream paper with experimental codes 10-994A, 10-
995A and 10-996A. It was decided that it would be sufficient to test only every fourth
pallet for Coresta, CaCO3 and MKP. Initially, the Coresta will be measured at R&D
while the possibility of getting a proper 10 cm? external clamp for Cabarrus is pursued.

Received samples from Roger Slagle for investigation of competitor (RJR)
cigarettes in white packs. A testing plan was developed with Liz Chambers, and
samples were distributed to PTL and General Analytical.

4A09 Support to Marketing/Market Research:

Supplied bobbins of 53 gim*, 9.5 Coresta low sidestream paper for additional
{mg prototype production in Semiworks and sent for larger quantities of paper from the
pallet we had arranged for K-C to ship to the warehouse.

Requested cigarettes for 8-port testing and prepared the sampies for
conditioning. Freddie Ford resmoked three of the earlier models after appropriate
aging (1 week) of the cigarettes. The sidestream visibility reduction improved to ~44%
versus the 3 day aging average of ~37%. The three models we resmoked were the
ones that had been selected as primary candidates.
