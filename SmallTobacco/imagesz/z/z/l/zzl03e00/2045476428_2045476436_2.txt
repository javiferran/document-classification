I.C.C.

In general, PM Blues' share in the ICC distributors continues to decline
-with Anter Brothers and Akron Tobacco registering at 0.2 and 0.3,

respectively for the 4 weeks ending 8/14/87. Akron's higher share level

during the last two weeks in July (18 & 19) is most likely a reflection

of intermittently supplying retailers who do not carry. the brand through
their primary sources of supply.
