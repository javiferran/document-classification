Retail Audit Data: Ethnic Store Panel

8/03

Distribution in the ethnic panel registered at 73% with a share level of
0.4 for the two week period ending 8/03. For the 4th consecutive
reporting period, this share was without any free product offer.

However, two stores (1 pack/1 carton) offered a free lighter with pack
purchase promotion.

Salem was the only free-standing menthol which offered a consumer
incentive (BIGIF) in the ethnic panel during this time period.
