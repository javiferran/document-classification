8/17

For the two week period ending 8/17 Blues registered a 0.5 with a slight
increase in distribution to 80%. Again, no aspect of the share was due
to BIGIF's or 5 for 2's; however, one outlet continued to offer the free
lighter with pack purchase promotion. During this period Kool also
offered a consumer incentive ($2.00 off on-carton coupon).
