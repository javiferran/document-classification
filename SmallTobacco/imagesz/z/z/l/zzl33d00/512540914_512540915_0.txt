The Honorable Robert E. Wise, Jr.

Dear Congressman Wise:

My responsibility as Secretary of Veterans Affairs! is to
provide a safe patient environment. America’s proud veterans,
whether smokers or not, require no artificial crutch o which
to base thelr dignity. It is inherent.

Recently, you received a letter from Representatives Wise
and Ridge urging you to support the smoking provisions jincluded
in H.R. 3192. They would have you believe that it is a matter

non-smokers who are forced to endure passive smoke.

Consider those who must endure catheters in the es or

The smoking provisions are the antithesis of good {health
practices. smoking kills and second-hand smoke kills. | Let me
get the record straight on a few issues raised by the
congressmen: |
° Only one of four veterans smoke. We provide gutdoor

smoking shelters at VA medical centers. Long term and
chronic care patients can still purchase tobagco from
VA canteens with medioal approval of their
physicians. We have instituted smoking cessation
programs to assist patients and employees who [wih to
stop smoking.

Qo The veteran who chooses to smoke does so of his own
accord. VA's policy establishes medical center
environments that encourage non-smoking behavior,
particularly among people who already have major
health problems which are aggravated by smoking, and
protects those who do not smoke and who can be damaged
by exposure to others’ snoke.
