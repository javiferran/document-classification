Subject: R5 IWO Recap - thru 10/30/99

Importance: High

Mike, Courtney, Scott,

Enclosed is last weeks recap of installations - we need to take a close look at R5's TPI
capabilities - we continue to lag behind the rest of the country. Why don't we discuss and
put together a game plan next week 11/8/99 when we meet in Denver.

I will forward to each section today the workbook that you compiled of IWOs that need
PM ffup and | will ask for a 2 week turnaround from the FSF to correct / update the issue.
Thanks,
