CONCLUSIONS

On the basis of stopping power ability, "Center Pack" and "Side
Pack" clearly outperformed "Newsprint". While both ads. performed
almost identically regarding total noting, “Center Pack"
demonstrated superiority over "Side Pack" on the unaided
measurement. .

Regarding communication, both Side: and Center Pack ads proved to
be more effective at generating product quality playback. In
particular, "Side Pack" was a better communicator of True's new
improved laser filter. This would seem important given the
marketing strategy behind new True. Both ads, however, prompted
recall. of low tar and nicotine, to about the same extent.

As was expected, "Pack" responses came up higher for the "Center
Pack" adi.

Both purchase intent and attribute rating levels were similar
across all ads. This may be due in part to the utilization of
identical copy for each of the ads. It. may also be related to
overall perceptions. of True that would not necessarily differ by
ad unless various marketing strategies. are presented.

All ads performed similarly on message believability and
importance.

Very few respondents confused the "Newsprint" ad for Merit.
Incorrect levels of brand noting were generally in line with
historical data.

Overall, and based on preliminary results, "Center Pack" and
"Side Pack" should be awarded future consideration. However,
given "Side Pack's" communicative advantages over the others and
the fact. that total noting was comparable to "Center Pack", the
edge: must go to "Side Pack",
