Re: SALEM LIGHTS Defensive Plan

As you know, the Arctic Lights brand is scheduled to begin

national advertising on March 26, 1979, Inasmuch as the Arctic Lights
brand will not be introduced until late March, 1979, the

SALEM LICHTS defensive effort should begin April, 1979. The result:
would be to alter the national break of the Defensive Plan by

one week in 120+ Market Importance groupings.

Therefore, this requests that the national break of the SALEM
LIGRTS Defensive Plan be the week of April 1 and not the week
of March 26, 1979, Marketing Management has agreed with this
start date. Please advise should you have any questions.
