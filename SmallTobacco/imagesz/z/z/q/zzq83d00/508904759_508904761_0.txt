BRANDS R&D TEST DESIGN SUPPORT PROGRAM

o Several additional studies have been designed for Brands R&D during the third
quarter of 1984. The major emphasis this quarter was on menthol related studies
for the FF and FFLT Menthol Teams. The designed studies were mainly screening,
in nature, and concentration of blend and casings variables.

CONSUMER SIMULATION MODEL PROGRAM
o FF and FFLT Non-Menthol Consumer Models

Modeling techniques have been used to predict 70+ acceptance and attribute
ratings on NFO testing of FF and FFLT non-menthol cigarettes. These models have
been recently refined and are designed to predict acceptance and attributes for
the following smoker groups testing RJR products:

FF competitive smokers
FF franchise smokers
FFLT competitive smokers
FFLT franchise smokers

o0o000

The predictive capability of these models has been shown to be quite good and is
based on cigarette design parameters relating to blend, casing, configurational
terms, and combinations of these. Results from these studies have been presented
at the September WINSTON Task Force meeting and the September MDM meeting.

o FF and FFLT Menthol Consumer Models

Analytical data and NFO consumer data are presently being collected on 200
additional cases for the development of the FF and FFLT menthol models. These
additional cases represent competitive brand tests and prototypes tests submitted
to NFO between 1981 and 1984. At present, the data on 40 cases has already been
completed. Preliminary models are anticipated to be generated by January, 1985.

o Consumer Test Data Base

Information continues to be added to this data base. At present information on
292 CT tests has been catalogued.

Â© Review of Competitive Brand Test Results

Information on the competitive wave results for thirteen RJR brands have been
received, catalogued, and are currently being reviewed. This program went into
effect as of September, 1984.
