o Review of Consumer Simulation Models by Tobacco International

A copy of the presentation given to the WINSTON Task Force on the FF and FFLT
Non-Menthol Consumer Simulation Models has peen sent to Dr. Hildegard Keller of
RJR Germany. Tobacco International still remains interested in the model

development technique and the models generated for competitive and franchise
smokers testing RJR domestic products.

MENTHOL and the DESIGN of _eeeeyxx—yx—x;_x————o

Work continues on a comprehensive review of the above topics.
PROJECT SA

o Attended Thirteenth Tobacco Institute College of Tobacco Knowledge in Washington,
D.c. A full report has been issued on the conference along with tape recordings
of the relevant presentations. (See I.0.M. dated July 23, 1984 to M. R. Savoca
and M. F. Dube - Trip Report)

o A review of Project SA activities on malodor has been issued (July 25, 1984).
The report deals with our present activities and includes recommendations. The
memo has been sent to M. F. Dube.

o PD 00211 and PD 00212 have been made in Research Plant. These eight (8) products
are Gori-type prototypes. They have a unique configuration, being 85mm and
22.5mm circumference. All prototypes have a visibly reduced sidestream. Four of
the prototypes contain G-26 (Propane puffed tobacco) and have a significantly
reduced visible sidestream compared to SA-I prototypes. The prototypes were
prepared to examine the effects of ESP-CC paper vs. 719, effects of G-26 vs.
WINSTON Blend and the effects of carbonized filler in WINSTON and G-26 blends.

o PD 00340, PD 00341 and PD 00359 have been written. These tests are scheduled to
be made the week of October 15. PD 00359 is a test to prepare 150 pounds of
propane puffed tobacco. The tobacco blend selected for this test was the same
formulation (Part II) used in the recent products chosen as the SA-I prototypes.
PD 00340 and PD 00341 are second generation Gori prototypes. The aim of these
tests (8 products total) will be to improve the taste characteristics of the
original prototypes (PD 00211 and PD 00212).

PROJECT TSB (2X)

Experiments have been completed for the TSB (ZX) patent. A written disclosure
has been received by M. J. E. Root III who is legal counsel for this project.
Three presentations have been made to RJR Domestic and International management
concerning the experimental design, results, conclusions, and implications. A
patent application was filed on August 31, 1984. This patent application names
Ms. T. B. Greene, Dr. D. E. Townsend and Dr. T. A. Perfetti as co-inventors of
the segmented cigarette concept.
