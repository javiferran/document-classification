Dear Sir:

In response to your concerns relative to the above referenced
order, you can be assured that the design-of this unit in no way
infringes on any existing patents.

The Bird Delta-Washer design employs an air-liquid separation
system which is enmman prantinm an all Fourdrinier paper machines
and makes no attempt to control the level within the individual
vacuum receptacles.

Furthermore, the patents for the original Fourdrinier type pulp
washer are owned and were developed by Ontario Paper Co. and
C.I.P. Co. from whom we license the rights to the Delta-Washer
technology.

In summary, we can assure you that the Bird Delta-Washer is free
of any infringement and, in fact, incorporates the most advanced
technology in countercurrent washing.

Best regards.
