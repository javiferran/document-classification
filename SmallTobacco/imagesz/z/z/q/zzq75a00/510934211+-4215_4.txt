Section III (89-39)

Polyethylene is a polymer of very low toxicity. Acute oral doses

of 8 g/kg or 90-day feeding studies of polyethylene (5% of
dietary intake) produced no adverse effects in rats (Clayton and
Clayton, Patty’s Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology, 1981). Mice
given 2.5 g/kg orally showed no toxic effects. Polyethylene has
been approved for direct food contact (21 CFR 175.300, 177.1520).
During thermal degradation of polyethylene at 800°C, carbon
monoxide is the principle gas evolved. At temperatures below
500°C, CO9, acrolein, formaldehyde, other aldehydes, ketones and
hydrocarbons are generated. Acrolein is the most acutely toxic
compound generated. It is an irritant to the eyes and
respiratory tract at 5 ppm and can be lethal at 10 ppm after
several hours. Pyrolysis of small quantities of polyethylene
will liberate such minute quantities of acrolein that no adverse
health effects would be expected. The American Conference of
Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has set the threshold
limit value (TLV) for acrolein at 0.1 ppm. _
