Re: Foreign Matter Log# 89-39

Investigation of Foreign Matter Log# 89-39 has been completed.
Facts and recommendations for disposal are herewith submitted.

Location - Tobaccoville Plant

Brand - ISLANDS 85 - Export

Foreign Matter - Brown Plastic (Polyethylene)
Quipped - 60 10M cases and 17,900 lbs. of cut filler

The piece of brown plastic (1) was found on the picker roller
during a normal VE-80 check. There was no choke-up during normal
operation. After plastic was found and the system cleaned, no
further foreign matter was found in the new bulker switched to.

After talking with Tobaccoville management and QC manager, Steve
Lane, we are of the opinion that this is an isolated incident and
that the piece of plastic in question may have been lodged there
for some time. With only 60 cases run and normal checks being
only once a day, this could have been lodged for 24 hours or
longer.

The piece of plastic is so small that searching the remainder of
cut filler would be virtually impossible to detect further pieces
this size.

It is the re pogagatien of Cigarette Standards and Tobaccoville
Qc that -: r to the VE-80 check be sent to the landfill
along with all rejects taken out during Protos clean-up. It is
also recommended that the cut filler in bulker be released for
production. If further plastic is found during this period (2
VE-80 checks daily) the remaining cut filler is to be canned off.
All work is to be quipped until bulker is emptied
