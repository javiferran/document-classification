suesect __Pho:

 

 

On 3/8 and 3/9, representatives of the Brand Group, Ted Bates, and
the B&W Esles Force called on Spanish retail outlets in the Phoenix
metro area, The objectives of this trip were as follows.

 

* Evaluate ROOL's performanee (all styles) at predominantly Hispanic
retail cutlets.

Evaluate Hispanic marxet performance of all brands and segments
in general to determine growth opportunities.

Evaluate in-store presence of al] brands and in-store promotional
activity.

Key Cbs

 

The Hispanic market in Pheenix is clearly a full-taste non-menthel
murket. Marlboro an¢ Winston are far and away the leading brands.
At best, menthol usage among Hispanic smokers is about equal to the
al average (30%), In ne way does menthol usage in the Hispanic
community resemble that of the Black community. There does not
appear to be any stigma asgociated with menthol cigarcttcs however,

 
     

 

KOOL and Salem full-taste styles are neck and neck in the Phoenix
Hispanic market but neither is considered by siore managers to be
a fast mover in compazisen to Marlboro and Winston,

Low 'tar' brands, menthol and non-menthol, nave exhibited only
marginal growth among Hispanics according to the trade. Roughly
10-20% of brands stocked in stores in the heart of the Hispanic com-
* munity were hi-fi's.
