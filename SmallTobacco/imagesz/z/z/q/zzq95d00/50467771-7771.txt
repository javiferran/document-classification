Re: Case #3200

Dear Dr. Frey:

Your recent inquiry concerning support by this Council of a proposed
research project has now been considered by the Executive Committee of the
Scientific Advisory Board.

The Committee expressed interest in examining a more detailed plan of the
proposed investigations. I take pleasure in enclosing the necessary fo-ms and
relevant literature pertaining to the filing of a formal application. The next
deadline for submitting proposals is May 31, 1991.

You understand, of course, that no commitment is implied at this time
concerning the final action of our full Scientific Advisory Board on the complete
proposal.

Sincerely yours,

Harmon C. McAllister
