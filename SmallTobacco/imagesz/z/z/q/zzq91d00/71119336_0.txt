Re: Billboards

Dear Messrs. Freedman & Cromer:

Thank you for your correspondence of March 3 and March 5, 1999, providing
additional information about your Ohio billboards so we could proceed with our
alternative advertising plans pursuant to MSA §III(d). As I informed you yesterday by
telephone, Ohio will proceed with placement of alternative advertising on all available
billboards, and to the extent any. billboards are no longer available, Ohio will accept
suitable and comparable substitute space of equivalent value.

Jane Kilgore of our Public Affairs staff has carefully reviewed the several lists
you provided and communicated directly with each of the outdoor advertising firms that
own or sell the space. Attached is the list of billboards we have compiled for placement
of Ohio’s alternative advertising program. In most instances, the billboards are those
you listed, and we have confirmed availability with the vendor. In those instances
where the billboards were no longer available, we have arranged for substitute space of
equivalent value. Any such billboards are included in the attached list. For example,
Cleveland Outdoor Advertising informed us that the 14x48 billboard at W. 117 and I-90
