Dear Loreen:

Here is a list of accomplishments from INBIFO/CRC:

e

Apart from that we of course have also worked on many aspects of SCoR and EHCSS, which are not part of the WSA

Guidance-related:

o Identification of further target(s) for reduction from in vitro cytotoxicity assay with validation in in vive lung

inflammation assay (hydroquinone)
o Identification of the particulate phase as sole contributor to in vive rat lung inflammation, no effect by
smoke from a non-tobacco cellulose cigarette
o Establishment of an in vitro rapid stress signaling screening assay (based on heme oxygenase 1
induction)
Evaluation-related:

o Mouse model for lung tumorigenesis (A/J mouse) reproduced (with ETS surrogate) and mechanistically

investigated
o CVD-related inhalation study in collaboration with externa! experts

o EHCSS-related lung inflammation in rats one third of that of conventional cigarettes (on equal TPM dose)

co PMscientific symposia on carbon monoxide and cancer
Capability enhancement:

o New CRC facility ready to move in
Update of GLP certifications for CRC and INBIFO

o

o AAALAC accreditation for CRC

o New Cardiovascular Research laboratory at INBIFO

o Evolving new technologies successfully initialized (transcriptomics, proteomics, non-invasive imaging)
o Invivo rapid screening assays initialized

Basic research-related:

o Newinsights into changes in cellular development (apoptosis/necrosis) by cigarette smoke and individual

constituents and fractions

projects.

Please do not hesitate to come back to me if you need further information.

Best regards,

Hans-Juergen
