RE: Document Disposal Suspension Notice

We have received a document request that calls for certain records, most of
which are already subject to disposal suspension under the Philip Morris Records
Management Program and prior disposal suspension notices. This notice will serve
to place the records described in the attachment to this memo under disposal
suspension. Prior disposal suspension notices and the Appendix entitled Topics

Subject to Disposal Suspension in each Records Management Manual remain in
effect without change.

If there is any question about whether a record is subject to this or other

disposal suspension notices, the record should be retained pending review by the
Legal Department. Questions should be addressed to John Mulderig (New York

x3056) in the Legal Department.
