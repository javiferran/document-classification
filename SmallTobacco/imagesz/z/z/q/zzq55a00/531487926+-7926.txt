</o><br><hr><br>Bonnie:<br><br>your responses are ok. on the third question, however, i would steer away
from suggesting that we'll likely go national with this product or repositioning. just stick with this is just a test
market in nyc's five boroughs and long island. and no decision has been made beyond
that.<br><br>richard<br><br> -----Original Message-----<br=From: Reese, Bonnie L.<tr>Sent: Friday,

W.<br>Subject: Three Q&amp;A's<br><br>Richard, | left a voice mail message for you this morning, but
thought I'd quickly recap<br>the three questions:<br><br>Question: African Americans predominately smoke
menthol cigarettes. Are you targeting blacks and other minorities with Salem?<br><br>Passible Response:
Absolutely not. There are a wide variety of people who smoke menthol cigarettes, and our new ad campaign
was designed to appeal to a broad base of adult menthol smokers.<br><br>l[if needed: I'd be glad to refer you
to our Public Information Dept., if you'd like.}<br><br><br>Question: What is the difference between the two
blends (new blend vs existing styles)?<br><br>Possible Response: The blend in our three new box styles has
a richer, tobacco taste vs a smoother, menthol taste in our current existing styles.<br><tr><br>Question: Are
you going to natural menthol in areas outside the NY Test Market?<br><br>Possible Response: At some
point, we will be changing to natural mentho! ori all Salem Brand styles nationally.<br><br>or -- “Depending
on the test market results, we may be changing to natura! menthol n ‘Bll Satem Brand styles
nationally."<br><br>Thanks.<br><br><br><br><br></body>
