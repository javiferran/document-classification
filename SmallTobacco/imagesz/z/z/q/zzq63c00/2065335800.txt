FYI, follows attached an article published today at “O Estado de S80 Paulo” about the
action moved against Souza Cruz which first articles I’ve sent you yesterday.

The attached article refers to important legal opinions, who believe Souza Cruz will win in
a second instance, considering that “manufacturing cigarettes is a legal activity...
Adversiting and warnings are regulated by law, which makes the cigarettes manufacturing
activity even more legitime.” One of the lawyers who has been consulted (Dr. Celso
Bastos) also added that “this decision is clearly oriented by US influence”.

An other lawyer (Dr. Jorge Celidénio) questioned “how it could be possible to determine
if the smoker only consumed cigarettes from Souza Cruz, during his whole life”, and still
complemented by saying that “if the person started to smoke as a kid, also his parents
should be considered guilty”. Still this same lawyer added “that other habits can also
provoque heart attacks”.

Only one attorney believes that “sf it could be proven that the smoker only consumed
cigarettes from Souza Cuz and that his death was really a consequence of the smoking
habit, the cause & effect relation would then be a fact”. This same attorney considered, at
the other hand, shese proves difficult to be obtained.
