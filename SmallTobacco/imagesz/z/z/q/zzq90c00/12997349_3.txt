EVALUATION

The W-3 Assault will be evaluated with the following

tools. Perhaps most importantly, we plan to switch Scanner
(consumer takeaway) vendors so that we can also measure
pack purchases (Nielsen does not):

~Scanner Research (IRI) -Redemption

~Compumark

An overview of W-3 is attached as Exhibit III for your
