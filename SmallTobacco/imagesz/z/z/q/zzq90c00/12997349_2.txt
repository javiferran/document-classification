W-3 MARKETING EFFORTS
Direct Marketing: Direct Marketing will function as the

integral connerstone of the Assault expansion. A
sequential stream of mailings will be deployed to take the
prospect from trial through to conversion. Mailings will
target 129,000 identified vulnerable competitive smokers in
Section W-3.

The direct plan will be a translation of an $8,500,000
national targeted/modelled effort (up from $7.5MM in CT).
We will purchase enough smoker names in W-3 to mail to
approximately 7% of all Low/Ultra Lot Tar names (top two
quintiles).

@ CARLTON will also participate in the Val Pack Coop direct
mail coupon program. CARLTON trial coupons (free pack and
B1G1F) will be distributed via the Val Pack program in Key
CARLTON opportunity zip codes to generate further trial by
likely prospects. A three time continuity mailing will be
coordinated.
