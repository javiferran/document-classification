APPROVAL RECOMMENDATION: CARLTON ASSAULT W-3 EXPANSION

 

The following proposal recommends funding an expansion of
the CARLTON Assault effort to Section W-3. Total estimated
costs are $1,920,000.

BACKGROUND

The CARLTON Assault is a fully integrated effort with all
the key elements (Advertising, Direct and Promotion)

focused to create maximum pressure against the retail
environment and competitive smokers. It is a swift and
powerful program designed to build business and capture new
share.

The Assault program is a strategic tool reserved for highly
developed growth opportunity areas -- success breeds
success. To achieve full impact, we continue to believe a
full year of activity is required. Thereafter, the Assault
strategy moves on to another strong area.

Section W-3 is our strongest CARLTON area with a 145 SDI
(2.29 share). W-3 represents 6.64% of population and, more
importantly, 9.61% of CARLTON sales.

W-3 is also scheduled to participate in the 1992 Future
Bold expansion which will provide added S/O support.

CONNECTICUT ASSAULT RESULTS
MSA, which covers the entire store universe, is showing a

positive CARLTON share trend. Due to shipment volatility,
we are examining three month moving shares.
