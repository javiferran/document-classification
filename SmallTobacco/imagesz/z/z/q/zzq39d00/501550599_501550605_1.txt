Developed in 1970 for the dcterminetion of nitric oxise

and nitrogen dioxide in automobile exhaust ceses (kiki,
o Warnick, and era, 1970), this method consists in an _

- oxidation of nitric oxide bY ozone to partially form elec-
tronicelly excited nitrogen dioxide (K03) and in a subse-
quent licht emission in the wavelength region 0.6°3 yp,
Which is unique to this reection, |

-Kitrogen dioxide is deternined by the same reaction ofter

Tada -(1962) reported the concentrations of NO to vary
between 72 end 271 ppu, and thet of hO. between 19 end 118
ppm. -Only 0-25 pp KO, beside 442-1008 ppm KO were deter-
mined by Norman and Xeith (1965).
