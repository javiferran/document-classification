of both the nitrozen oxides is quite fundanental. For, ;
the niirosating, agent involved is 903, which is formed
dJmmediately after ho uns nO, get together in cquinoler

concentrations. N20, directly or indirectly reacts with
the anple secondary and possibly with tertiary onines of

the tobecco smoke to form the K-nitrosemines.

if, according to Norman and keith (1965), the original
concentration of HO, is low, its fornation by the oxidation
of NO through the residual oxygen in the smoke would deter-
nine the reaction rate of the K-nitrosanine formation,
because, as a trimolecular reaction eccording to the

equation
2 xO + 0. = 2 NO,

this reection would be the slovest in the chain.

Experimental

hO and 1.05 a@ecterminaeticn in tobacco smoke

The determination of the nitrogen oxides was carried out

with a Scott j:odel 125 Chemilurninesccnce 0/205 Analyzer

1090 Sctog

equipped with a W4¥ Dual Pen Recorécr 1200 in the sensitivity

ranges O-1f,00 to 0O-10P00 vpn.

For the kO measurenent the instrumcnt was run under converter

bypass.
