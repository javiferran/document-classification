Interference studics revealed ammonia, several onines,
pyridines, and ;yrazines to be effective KO sources in

the converter treal:ent, rn ae
At this tinc studies are under way to overcone this inter-
ference by two sdiffercnt technigues: retention of the

bases in traps containing solid, valer insoluble acids,

‘and variation of the converter and its tempers ture to ens. 7
optimun, which vould be reached, if NO, would sufficiently.
be converted to KO ans no other ni trogen compound would - wo0G

be oxidized to XO. . oe , eo to De 7

First attempts revealed that acid traps led to reduced oa :
x0, values, but not as little KO5 was found as ‘corresponds

to the findings of Korman and Keith (1965). |.”

In general the hO contents of the smoke of the various,
Cigarette brands are in good agreement with the values _

-to be expected from the well known pattems of the nitrate
or nitrogen contents of different tobacco types (Lipp and
Ddlberg, 1964; Keurath and Ehwke, 1964): The values ere
high with cigarettes from air cured tobaccos (Burley, black,
ana cigar tobaccos) and low with cigarettes mainly contain-

ing flue cured or oriental types of tobacco.

The further program comprises model trials on the influence
of the main factors: oxygen, residence time, temperature,
‘and moisture contents on the interaction of the nitrogen
oxides end their reaction with amines and other nitrosatab2
