5 machine run x 10 cig = 50 cig/day.

50 cig/day x 182 days = 9100 cig.

9100 cig x 2.5 mg/cig = 22.75 gn MCA.

9100 cig/(1800 cig/4 machines/wk = 5.0 wks to fill cig.
9100 Benzene treated cig = 5.0 wks to treat cig.

Although 1001C, D and E will be carried together, it
will be necessary to carry two sets of Benzene treated
cig. controls.

D. BaP Fortified Smoke Studies

The Studies with BaP Fortified Smoke will require a
higher total dose carcinogen than MCA based on the earlier
intratracheal studies. [In the IT studies a treatment of
10 x 1.2 mg/2 weeks was sufficient to induce malignant
tumors while 10 x 0.6 mg/2 weeks produced adenomas. We
propose to expose mice to 10 cigarettes per day containing
10 mg/cigarette BaP for a period of 22 weeks to achieve
the same 12 mg BaP deposited in the lungs IT inoculation -
in approximately the same period. To give 6.0 mg BaP
in the same time frame we will give the mice 5 fortified
cigarettes and 5 standard cigarettes.

In order to determine the effect of continued smoke
after 22 weeks on fortified cigarettes, we propose to use:
the higher dose level (12 mg) and look for an increase
in malignant tumors and a reduction in latency for tumor
development over a group which receives no futher smoking.

The following is an outline of the requirements for such
a study.

T. 003A: 10 mg BaP/cig, 10 cig/day, 22wks, 12.0 mg BaP/mouse.
60 mice/(12 mice/machine) = 5 machine runs.
5 machine runs x 10 cig = 50 cig/day.
50 cig/day x 154 days = 7700 cig.
7700 cig/ (1800 cig/t machine) = 4.2 wks to load cig.
This must be doubled in order to provide mice which
will not be smoked beyond the 22 week period.
7700 cig Benzene treated = 4.2 wks to treat.

2. 1003B: 10 mg BaP/cig, 5 fortified cig/day + 5 untreated
cig/day, 22 wks, 6.0 mg BaP/mouse.
60 mice/(12 mice/machine) = 5 machine runs.
5 machine runs with fortified cig x 5 cig = 25 cig/day. ~
25.cig/day x 154 days = 3850 cig with BaP.
3850 cig x 10 mg/cig = 38 gm BaP.
3850 cig/(1800 cig/4 machines) = 2.1 wks to load cig.
â€˜Same Benzene controls as for {[003A. ,
