Fortified Smoke Studies

Cigarette Fortificetion Equipment Capacity
One Machine:
10 cigarettes/run x 7 runs/day x 7 day/wk = 490 cig.
Four Machines:
490 cig/machine/7 day wk x 4 machines = 1960 maxium
Anticipated usable cigarettes = 1800/wk

Toxicity studies Scheduled for January

In the Toxicity studies mice will be smoked with for-
tified smoke for a period of 4 weeks, 10 cig/day, 10 mg/cig.
At the end of the 4 week period we proposed to stop smoking
and hold the mice for tumor occurrence at the time of mor-
bidity. We propose to use the mice now adapted to smoke
which have had Sendai infections. After they have been
smoked with MCA or BaP or Benzene treated cigarettes, they
will be moved from 4807 Laboratory to 4809 Laboratory for
observation. This will allow 4807 to be decontaminated and
new mice to be brought into the facility.

MCA, 10 mg/cig, four - 7 day weeks.
60 mice/(12 mice/machine run) = 5 machine runs/day.
5 machine runs x 10 cig = 50 cig/day.
50 cig/day x 28 days = 1400 cig. .
1400 cig x 10 mg MCA/cig = 14 gm MCA.
1400 cig/(450 cig/one loading machine) = 3.1-wks.
1400 cig/(1800 cig/4 machines) = 0.77 wks.

BaP ~ same as MCA
1400 cig, T4 gm BaP, 0.77 wks to load on 4& Machines.

Benzene treated cig.
1400 cig, O.77 wks to load on 4 machines or 3.1 wks
on oné machine.

MCA Series of Fortified Smoke Studies
Two Studies are proposed with MCA:

We will combine [001A and B to determine if short term
MCA exposure followed by long term Standard Smoke will
induce tumors. This would aliow more fortified smoke
studies to be undertaken by first exposing to fortified
smoke on the Walton and then transfering to the SEM for
long term smoking which may act as a promoter. The fol-
lowing studies have not included a very important group
of controls. We have not included mice which will re-
ceive the MCA in smoke and then allowed to live without
smoking. The inclusion of these mice required the re-
thinking of the entire schedule, equipment capacity,
personnel, etc. in most studies. We could include one
such group with {001A and B, but not both the 3.25 and
7.0 week exposure period. I! want to suggest that we
run one more group for 7 weeks on fortified smoke and
no futher smoking.
