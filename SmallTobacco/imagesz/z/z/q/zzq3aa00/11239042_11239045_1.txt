We will combine [001C, D and E to determine the effects
of exposing mice to fortified smoke for a longer period
of time (13 weeks and 26 weeks). The 13 week period

was selected based on the period of MCA exposure to 6-IT
inoculations at 2 week intervals. The 26 week period
was selected based on the need to increase the amount

of MCA given when 2.5 mg fortified cigarettes are used.

Although this study is quite large with the three
levels of exposure, we could include one group of mice
at one level only which would not be continued on un-
fortified smoke. For such a study we should use either
the 10 cig for 13 weeks or 10 cig for 26 weeks.

The following is a brief outline of the various re-
quirements for the MCA Fortified Smoke Studies.
1OO01A: 10 mg MCA/cig, 10 cig/day, 3.25 wks - 1.4 mg MCA/mouse.
60 mice/(12 mice/machine) = 5 machine runs.
5 machine runs x 10.cig = 50 cig/day.
50 cig/day x 23 days = 1150 cig.
1150 cig x 10 mg/cig = 11.5 MCA.
1150 cig/ (1800 Cig/h machine) = 0.65 wks to load cig.
1150 cig loaded with Benzene alone = 0.65 wks to load cig.

1001B: 10 mg MCA/cig, 10 cig/day, 7.0 wks, 2.8 mg MCA/mouse,

' 60 mice/(12 mice/machine) = 5 machine runs.

5 machine runs x 10 cig = 50 cig/day.

50 cig/day x 49 days = 2450 cig.

2450 cig x 10 mg/cig = 24.5 gm MCA.

2450 cig/(1800 cig/4 machines) = 1.3 wks to load cig.
This will be doubled if we choose to have. one group

smoked only with fortified cigarettes and not continued

on regular smoke. This study will be run with [001A

therefore the same benzene controls will be used.

1OO1C: 2.5 mg MCA/cig, 5 loaded cig/day & 5 standard cig/day,
13 wks, 0.74 mg MCA/mouse. .

60 mice/(12 mice/machine) = 5 machine runs.

5 machine runs x 5 cig = 25. cig/day.

25 â‚¬ig/day x 91 days = 2275 cig.

2275 cig x 2.5 mg/cig = 5.6 gms MCA,

2275 cig/(1800 cig/4 machines) = 1.4 wks to fill cig.

4550 cig Benzene treated = 2.5 wks to fill cig.

{001D: 2.5 mg MCA/cig, 10 cig/day, 13 wks, 1.5 mg MCA/mouse.
60 mice/(12 mice/machine) = 5 machine runs.

5 machine runs x 10 cig = 50 cig/day.

50 cig/day x 91 days = 4550 cig.

8550 cig x 2.5 mg/cig = 11.3 gm MCA.

4550 cig/(1800 cig/4& machines/wk) = 2.5 wks to Fill

Same Benzene Controls as [OOIC.

1OO1E: 2.5 mg MCA/cig, 10 cig/day, 26 wks, 3.0 mg MCA/mouse.
60 mice/(12 mice/machine) = 5 machine runs.
