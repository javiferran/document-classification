The above studies using fortified smoke are based on
using one sex (female), one strain of mice (BC3F1), one
cigarette type (Al), one exposure time (30 seconds, 10%
smoke) and only 60 mice to a group. Mice will be adapted
slowly to 10 cig/day (5 in the AM and 5 in the PM) over a
two month period and then maintained at this level for one
month prior to giving fortified smoke. We hope to use the
SEM for adaptation and change over to the Walton only the
last | or 2 weeks prior to fortified smoke. We hope to do
the long term smoking following the fortified smoke on the
SEM also.

The major problem {| find with our experimental design
is the number of mice per group. The groups are limited
to sixty mice because of the necessity of smoking fortified
cigarettes in the hood. The small number of mice necessi-
tates that mice be allowed to become moribund before sacre-
fice. If we find a number of tumors in moribund mice we
.can of courseâ€™ do a terminal sacrifice with the remaining
mice.

1f the short term exposure of the first study with
MCA produces tumors this of course would greatly increase
our capabilites to do these types of studies.

| understand these experiments have caused a great
deal of controversy. They must be sold to the industry as
a model system which allows the study of cigarettes forti-
fied with various CSC fractions to determine what the most
carcinogenic or cocarcinogenic component of tobacco smoke
really is. They must be assured we are not going to im-
plicate smoke carcinogenesis on the basis of highly fortified
cigarettes using MCA which does not exist in tobacco smoke
naturally. ,
