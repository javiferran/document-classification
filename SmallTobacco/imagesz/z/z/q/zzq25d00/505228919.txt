MS SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES
w/o 10/6/86

Brand met with Production Planning to develop a manufacturing
timetable for Project MS. Production is tentatively scheduled
for a 2/16/87 start-up date, with test market quantities
available by 2/25 for a 3/30 DTS. These dates will be confirmed
once quantity requirements per style are provided by Forecasting.

Brand met with Purchasing and Packaging Technology to discuss . :
timing and next steps for MS packaging development/production.
A timetable was developed, to be presented as part of the total
MS marketing plan the week of 10/13. As current status,

pack and carton comps have been reviewed by Management and
minor revisions requested to improve the readability of the
medalion logo and to use the conventional spelling of "lights"
rather than "lites" on the FFLT style. Revised designs are
expected this week.

Long, Haymes and Carr presented to the Brand revised creative
for several alternative MS advertising campaigns which currently
are under consideration for the April 1987 test market. The
Agency also provided additional price and quality descriptors
which were developed under the objective of succinctly
communicating MS' dual benefits of virile/young adult user
imagery and generic price. Brand selected several visuals

for development into color comps to be presented to R. A. Kampe
this week. Creative and alternative copy lines will then be
taken to focus groups the week of 10/27.
