Measurement of the Sampling Efficiency of Currently Available
Bio-aerosol Samplers _
PI: Robert J. Aitken, Ph.D.
Institute of Occupational Medicine
Edinburgh, Scotland .

The research team will measure the sampling efficiencies of a group of the
current generation of bio-aerosol samplers to determine their range of
applicability and error magnitudes in relation to the internationally
agreed sampling conventions. Results will lead to the determination of
better airborne concentration estimates of bio-aerasols. 7
