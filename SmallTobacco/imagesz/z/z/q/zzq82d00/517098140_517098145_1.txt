IN THIS ACCOUNT UNDER NORMAL GAP STRATEGY, WE WOULD
DISCOUNT FULL PRICE .55 CENTS. BY USING THE PROFITMETER WE HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO GET THE RETAILER TO REDUCE PRICE BY KEEPING SAME
MARGIN AS BEFORE DISCOUNT. WE WOULD GIVE STORE 30 CENTS
INSTEAD OF THE 55 CENTS. IN TURN, WE HAVE SPENT LESS MONEY ON
THE DISCOUNT BUT GET A PRICE CLOSE TO THE GAP. IN A NUMBER OF
STORES WE ARE ABLE TO GET THE PRICE REDUCED TO $1.99 BECAUSE
THAT PRICE POINT IS ATTRACTIVE.

IN MANY CASES, I HAVE STARTED THE PROCESS OF TALKING ABOUT THE
STORE PRICING BY SHOWING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FULL PRICE
AND SAVINGS MARGINS. WHEN THE MARGIN IS 30% OR HIGHER ON FULL
PRICE AND ONLY 25% TO 27% ON SAVINGS, I POINT OUT TO THE RETAILER
THIS HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON WHY THEY SELL SO MANY MORE SAVINGS
BRANDS. THEN I POINT OUT THAT BY LOWERING THE FULL PRICE TO THE
SAME MARGIN AS SAVINGS, THEY WOULD THEN SELL LARGER AMOUNT
OF FULL PRICE BRANDS AND TAKE MORE MONEY TO THE BANK. MOST
STORES UNDERSTAND THIS FACT.

EXAMPLE:

RETAIL COST MARGIN
FULL PRICE: $2.35 $1.70 28%
SAVINGS: $1.70 $1.45 14.5%

PRICE GAP IS 65 CENTS BEFORE DISCOUNT.

PRICING AFTER 20 CENT GPC DISCOUNT
FULL PRICE: $2.35 $1.70 28%

SAVINGS $1.50 $1.25 17%

PRICE GAP IS 85 CENTS AFTER GPC DISCOUNT.

I WOULD SHOW STORE ON THE PROFITMETER WHEEL THAT IF THE FULL
PRICE WAS AT THE SAME MARGIN AS SAVINGS AFTER DISCOUNTING, FULL
PRICE WOULD BE AT:

FULL PRICE $2.05 17%

SAVINGS $1.50 17%
