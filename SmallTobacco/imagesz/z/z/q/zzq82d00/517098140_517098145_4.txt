*WE HAVE CONTACTED OUR SALES REPS. AND THEY ARE NOW WORKING
UP TO 50 CENTS ON THE PRICE GAP. OUR DIVISION HAS MANY EXAMPLES
WERE THE PRICE GAP IS AT THE 50 CENT AMOUNT DUE TO THE HIGHER
MARGINS BEING TAKEN ON THE FULL PRICE PRODUCT.

SAVINGS CEILING STRATEGY:

WE ARE STILL SEEING B&W ACTIVITY ON GPC ABOVE THE $1.50 AMOUNT.
THIS IS BEING DONE AT SELECTIVE ACCOUNTS. SOME ACCOUNTS ARE AT
NO DISCOUNT WHILE OTHERS ARE AT $1.50 - $4.00. WE ARE STILL
MAINTAINING THE $2.00 CEILING ON ALL SAVINGS.

B&W - PM CONTRACTS:

THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY NEW ACTIVITY BY B&W OR PM REGARDING
THEIR CONTRACTS. WE HAVE NOT HAD MUCH RESPONSE FROM EITHER
ONE REGARDING OUR NEW CONTRACTS. ONE THING THAT HAS COME UP
IS THAT ONCE PM HEARS THAT WE NEED 30% OF THE ADVERTISING, THEY
ARE TAKING DOWN ANY EXTRA IN THE CALL. OUR REPS. ARE NOW
ADDRESSING THIS WITH THE RETAILER.
