LISTED BELOW IS THE STATUS FOR THE MONTH OF MAY FOR DIVISION
5624 NORTH SEATTLE:

FULL PRICE STRATEGY:

I HAVE BEEN WORKING INDIVIDUALLY WITH OUR SALES REPS. IN RETAIL
ACCOUNTS TO REDUCE THE PRICING MARGINS BETWEEN FULL PRICE AND
SAVINGS PRICE. WHEN THE PRICE GAP ON FULL PRICE PRODUCT IS OVER
60 CENTS TOTAL, THERE IS USUALLY A DIFFERENT MARGIN USED TO
DETERMINE THE FULL PRICE AND THE SAVINGS BRANDS.

ATTACHED YOU WILL FIND A PROFITMETER WHEEL THAT I PICKED UP
OVER 3 YEARS AGO. I USE IT TO FIND THE MARGIN THAT THE STORE IS
USING FOR SETTING THEIR PRICES. THE KOREAN ACCOUNTS
UNDERSTAND THE WHEEL VERY WELL AND CAN SEE IT IN BLACK AND
WHITE, INSTEAD OF A CALCULATOR. AS YOU CAN SEE THE WHEEL IS
VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND.

HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR MARKET:

PACKAGE ACCOUNTS

RETAIL PRICE COST MARGIN
FULL PRICE: $ 2.55 $ 1.70 33%
SAVING PRICE: $ 1.85 $ 1.45 21.5%

SAVINGS PRICE AFTER B&W DISCOUNTING OF 20 CENT:

SAVINGS PRICE: $1.65 $ 1.25 24.5%
