BECAUSE OF A 55 CENT GAP WE WOULD THEN DISCOUNT CAMEL,
WINSTON AND WINSTON SELECT 20 CENTS AND GET THE FOLLOWING
PRICING:

RETAIL COST MARGIN
FULL PRICE: $1.85 $1.50 19%
SAVINGS $1.50 $1.25 17%

IN MANY CASES THE STORE CAN SEE THAT THE PRICING OF SAVINGS
WITH A LOWER MARGIN IS BEING DONE BY OTHER STORES AROUND THEM
AND THEY ARE ONLY MATCHING THE PRICING.

BY LOWERING THE PRICE MARGIN ON THE FULL PRICE BRANDS SUCH AS
CAMELS, RJR WILL HELP SUPPORT THE PRICE REDUCTION AND THEY WILL
LIKELY HAVE A PRICE ADVANTAGE THAT OTHER STORES DO NOT HAVE.

THIS PROGRAM IS BEING PRESENTED IN CALLS THAT ARE SIGNING OUR
NEW PARTNERS CONTRACTS. THESE ACCOUNTS SEE THAT BY SELLING
CAMELS, WINSTONS, AND WINSTON SELECTS WITH A MARGIN CLOSER TO
SAVINGS, THEY WILL INCREASE RJR SALES AND INCREASE CONTRACT
MONIES.

ON THURSDAY, JUNE 1, 1995, WE PLAN TO GIVE ALL OF OUR REPS.
PROFITMETER WHEELS AND TAKE THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS.
