MEMORANDUM

TO: All Employees

FROM: A. W. Spears

SUBJECT: USA TODAY -— PHONE SURVEY

—— ee NINE SURVEY

"Final results are in from a phone-

in survey by USA TODAY and
USA TODAY: THE TELEVISION SHOW
on the question: Should smoking
be banned in all public places?
NO, say 64,711 callers vs. 55,208
endorsing such a ban."

That's the way USA TODAY reported the results in
today's edition. fThat!

S all that was written, no more.
can assure you that if

the vote had gone the other way, the
results would have been spread across page one.

We won 54% - 463._
We won’ because we did something.
We won because many of you took the time to be heard.

I honestly believe if we hadn't acted, USA TODAY woulda
have had a front page story.

My thanks to you are boundless; may your Thanksgiving
wonderful as mine will now be.
