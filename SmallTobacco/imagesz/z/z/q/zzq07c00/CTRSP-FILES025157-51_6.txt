variables to replace 5 of the original variables.
The additional dummy variables contained 3 for
chronometry (“symptom duration”), 3 for symp-
fom pattern, 2 for functional severity, 2 for TNM
stage, 5 for histologic type, and 2 for other
smoking.

The 27 coded variables were entered into the
analyses as the independent predictor variables
for each patient. For the linear, logistic, and
discriminant function procedures, the outcome
variable for each patient was coded as alive or
dead at 6 months after zero time. For the Cox-1
and Cox-S procedures, the outcome variables
were coded as the actual survival times, with
living patients being censored at either 1 or 5
years, as described earlier.

ORIGINAL RESULTS

In previous analyses [14] of data for the 1266
patients. 2 complex set of clinical and statistical
judgments had been used to partition the
original 17 variables into categories, and to
combine those categories into the five composite
stages or strata, designated as A-E. The biologic
components of those strata, as noted earlier,
came from categories of the symptom pattern,
Functional severity, and TNM stage variables.
The remaining 14 basic variables were omitted
from the A-E composite stages mainiy for the
sake of simplicity and also because they did not
scem to add a major prognostic impact beyond
the three selected variables. Nevertheless, to
allow the mathematical models a chance to
work with all the appropriate data, the 14
additional variables were included in the current
analyses.

Table 2 shows the distribution of the entire
cohort in the composite A~E stages, and the
6-month survival rates for each stage. The
composition of the cohort showed that almost
three-fifths of its members were in Stages D and
E (G1 and 26% respectively), with the remainder

distributed in proportions of 18-12% in Stages
A-C. The overall survival rate, 44% at 6
months, is partitioned into a large prognostic
gradient, ranging fram 85% survival into Stage
A to 14% in Stage E.

SUBSEQUENT ACTIVITIES

Creation of challenge set

Before any analytic work was done with the
data, 200 patients were randomly selected, by
stratified sampling within the A-E stages, to be
a “challenge set”, having the same proportion-
ate distribution as the parent population of 1266
cases. The challenge set, which was put aside for
testing subsequent predictions, had the follow-
ing numbers and proportions of patients in each
stratum: A, 35 (18%); B. 26 (13%); C, 24 (12%);
D, 63 (1%); and E. 32 (26%).

Preparation of generating samples

After selection and sequestration of the
challenge set, the remaining 1066 patients in the
parent population were used to prepare 7 sets
of generating samples, each containing 400
patients. These patients were chosen, by strati-
fied random sampling, to produce groups
having the following defined “shapes” in their
distributions of the A~E strata: proportional,
uniform, symmetric unimodal, bimodal, de-
creasing exponential, increasing exponential,
and U-shaped.

Each sample was “replaced” in the 1066
patients before selection of the next sample;
thus, a particular patient might be a member of
more than one generating sample. The different
shapes of the generating samples were chosen to
offer a wide and challenging spectrum of statis-
tical distributions for the same biologic phen-
omena. Because the phenomena would retain
the same biologic attributes, regardless of their
statistical distributions, the different arrange-
ment would serve as a test for the “biologic
