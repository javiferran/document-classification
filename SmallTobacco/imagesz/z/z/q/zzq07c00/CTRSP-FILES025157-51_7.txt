robustness” of the mathematical models. A
model that was teo “data dependent” might not
be able to recognize and distinguish the import-
ant biologic attributes when they appeared in
different statistical distributions.

For the arrangements, the proportional
sample of 460 patients was distributed across
the A~E categories in the same pattern as the
original population, and the uniform sample
contained 80 members in each group. For the
symmetric unimodal, exponential, U-shape, and
bimodal distributions, suitable patterns were
obtained by taking sample sizes in adjacent A-E
stages to have the approximate ratios of 2:3 or
3:2. The numbers of patients in the strata of
these seven generating sets are shown in Table 3.

' Although the basic biologic attributes of the
predictors rernained unchanged, the overall 6-
month survival rates in the seven generating sets
varied with their distributional arrangements
and randomly chosen constituents. Table 4
shows the 6-month survival rates for each stra-
tum in each sample. As expected, the survival
rates remained similar (within limits of random
variation) for each of the five strata in each
sample. The overall survival rates among the
seven groups, however, ranged from a high of
64% to a low of 33% in the two exponentially
distributed samples, which had the highest

We now had a sequestered challenge set of
200 patients, seven generating samples of 400
patients each, and five mathematical methods.
to be tested. In the operational procedures, all
of the independent variables were standardized
within each generating sample to permit a direct
comparison of the partial regression coefficients.

Parts II and HI of this series describe the
operations and results obtained when the multi-
variable analytic procedures were applied to the
seven generating sets of data, and later, to the
challenge set.
