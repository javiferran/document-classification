OK, not a problem. They are located within the City limits, though about as
far as you can get towards the suburbs without crossing out of the City.

The school is located in what we call the Far Northeast, which is primarily

a white middle class neighborhood, many residents of which do not consider
themselves to be part of the City. I'll be very interested to hear your

report on the diversity of the student body, since the school's Website
(http:/Avww.philadelphiaacademy.org/index.html) promotes it as an
institution commited to diversity. The school is run by a for-profit

company. The Website is pretty poor -- not much info to be had there, ccc
