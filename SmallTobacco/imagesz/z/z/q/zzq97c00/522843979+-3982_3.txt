USE OF BRC TO REQUEST REFERRAL KIT - cary made suggested option to include bre to be
given to friends who could then send in for referral kit; rather than sending out with each carton
order. key issue: would eliminate challenge of getting the referral kit inon the carton mailer,
would eliminate waste of materials and additional mailing if can't get kit in/on carton, would

provide self selection. this option will not be pursued. current direction is to include the referral kit
inside each carton order.

SHIPPING CONTAINERS - need to consult with brand on acceptability of plain brown/white
corregate 4 pack and 1 ctn standard boxes. have confirmed that a 2 ctn std box does not exist.
white corregate is slightly more expensive than brown. brown ctn boxes are a stock item and
inventory is continuously replenished at the lowest possible cost. possible option to “dress up” the
box: peel and stick eclipse oval logo. key issue: customer perception of cost of shipping
materials, meeting brand marketing objectives, keeping costs low on test program. ideally

would like to include referral kit for friends in carton order, brown boxes will be used for the test.

CARTON FINISHED GOOD - the brand has agreed to establish one configuration for all carton
inserts (documentation reflects components). key Issue: how will the product style be
transmitted to GATX for proper fulfillment and what Impact will this have on multiple finished
goods? YA will pass identification for style ordered. GATX will use cross-reference table to pack
correct style, resulting in 4 finished goods. ‘
