Well, with Market Group | concluded, | would like to take this opportunity to personally
thank you and your local market staff for assisting in a job well done.

Thank you for your dedication and commitment. After being in those wonderful crowded,
sold-out clubs, | am convinced that this promotion is without a doubt America’s premier
summer club promotion.
