Attached is a memo from Wachtell Lipton which | would like you to review.
As you will see, in addition to outlining certain assumptions (which should be
corrected if erroneous), they have identified documents that we will need to
consult. it would be helpful if you could either bring these documents to
Thursday's meeting or at least be familiar with their location.

You will also find a copy of the amended complaint which has been
highlighted to focus on issues for which your input is specifically requested.
