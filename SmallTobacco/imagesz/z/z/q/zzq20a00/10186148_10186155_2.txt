Capoing

There is little difference in the percent of cells which cao Slq,
RTl, or thy-1 (Table 1), although, Sig caps after the application
of a single ligand while RTl and thy-1 require two ligands. RT1
caps equally well on thymocytes and splenocytes and thy-1 caps
equally well whether monoclonal or alloantibody is used as the
first antibody.

FRAP

Sig - Surface immunoygivouTin when tabeied wilh Fi-Fab* anti-iy is
relatively restricted in motion when compared to RT1 and_ghy-}
(Table Il). It diffuses more slowly (D = 1.0 + 0.1 x 10” cm'/sec)
and the extent of recovery is less (% R = 37 + 2). SIg when cross
linked with 100 ug/ml of F(ab"), is almost completely immobite
(%R=8+ 2). Satisfactory labeling of cells could not be a-
chieved with Tess then 100 ug/ml of antibody.

RT1 - RT1 when labeled wgth B1-Fab' anti-RTl is more mobile than
SIg (0 = 2.7 + 0.2 x 10° cm/sec, 2 R = 62 + 2). RTL remains “10
mobile when labeled with 100 ug/ml F1-F(ab'), (D = 8.4 +1 x 10
cm/sec, % R = 42 + 3) and is immobilized by°400 ug/ml of F(ab‘),
(R= 11+ 2).

Thy- 1 - Thy-1 when labeled with Fab! anti-bhy-} is more mobile
than either SIg or RT1 (D = 8.4 + 0.7 x 10° cw /sec, BR 2 86 +
3). Thy-1 remains mobile when Vabeted with F(ab‘), (D = 1.8 + 0.2
