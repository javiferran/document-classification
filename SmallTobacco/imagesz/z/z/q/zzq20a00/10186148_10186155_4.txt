"Data shown are the percent recovery and diffusion coefficients of
cells labeled with F1-F(ab'), and Fl-Fab' antibodies directed
against thy-1, RT1 and SIg.

In parentheses, number of bleached cells.

“The percent recovery of fluorescence in the bleached area was
determined by the following formula:

% Recovery = I, (m) - I, (0) x 100

: I, QO; - In 0

Where I, (m) fs the maximal tluorescence intensity at the end of
recovery, I, (0) and | (o) ere, respectively, the fluorescence .
intensity ifmediately Before and after bleaching. The data ere
expressed as the mean + S.E.M.

“The diffusion coefficients were calculated from values of T1/2
with the equation: BW
De W2

Where W is the half width of the laser beam evaluated at en?
( = 0.135) hal# height and B is a parameter which depends on the
vercent bleach. The data ere expressed as the mean + S.E.M

DISCUSSION

Our FRAP experiments have shown that there is heterogeneity in the
diffusion characteristics of lymphocyte membrane proteins.
