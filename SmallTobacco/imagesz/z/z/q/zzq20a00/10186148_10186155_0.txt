ABSTRACT

Surface immunoglobulin (SIg), RTL (rat histocompat ibility proteins)
and thy-1 present on rat lymphocytes cap with similar kinetics and
to the same extent, the only difference being the antibody require.
ment. SIg requires one Cross-linking antibody to induce Capping,
while RT1 and thy-1 require two antibodies, Fluorescence recovery
after photobleaching experiments show that there is heterogeneity
in the diffusion Characteristics of lymphocyte membrane proteins.
SIg is relatively immobile when labeled by Fab! and is immobilized
by F(ab'),. RT diffuses 2.7 times as fast as S!g and the mobile
fraction bf RTl is greater. When RTL is cross-linked by relatively
Tow concentrations of F(ab"), its mobility is about the Same as
that of SIg. When the concehtration of F(ab’), is increased, RT
is immobilized. Thy-1 diffuses faster than sig and has a higher
mobile fraction. then thy-] is labeled with F{ab’)}, it remains
mobile and is immobilized when a Second antibody lafer is added,
The relative order of mobility is thy-1 >> RT1 > SIg.

INTRODUCTION

Lymphocyte membrane proteins undergo polar migration or capping
after Cross-linking by antibodies (Schreiner and Unanue, 1976),

Capping characteristics, _The prototype of one class is surface
immunoglobulin (SIg) which caps after binding of a Single cross-
linking ligand. RT] (rat histocompatibil ity proteins) and thy-1
are members of a second class of integral membrane proteins which
Cap only after the additidn of a second ligand (Braun, et. al.,
1978; Gilman, et. al., 1981; Woda, et. al., 1979),
