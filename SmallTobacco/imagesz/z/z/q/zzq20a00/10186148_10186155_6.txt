et. al, 1979), when we used cross-linking anti-thy-1, the D
and mobile fraction of thy-1 approached that of SIg and thy-1
was immobilized by a second ant ibody.

lattice formed on the membrane and the association of membrane

proteins with coated pits may influence the mobility characteristics
of membrane proteins.

The arrangement of proteins in the membrane may be of functional
Significance. Whether cross-linking of membrane protein receptors
provides a mitogenic or differentiative signal may depend on the
interaction of the receptor with the cytoskeleton and the later
intracellular fate of the receptor-ligand complex.
