In this paper we present data on the lateral mobility of S!g, RT)
and thy-1 as measured by fluurescence recovery after photobleaching
(FRAP) when labeled by cross-linking and non-cross~linking anti-
bodies and correlate these results with the capping characteristics
of these proteins. This data shows that while there appear to be
only two classes of lymphocyte membrane protein capping, the lateral
mobility of membrane proteins is more heterogeneous. The relative
order of lateral mobility of membrane proteins is thy-1 >> RT1 >

SIg.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cells -Lewis rat spleen cell suspensions were prepared as previous-
ly described (Woda and Feldman, 1979).

Antibodies - The preparation of fluorescein labeled (F1) F(ab'), anc

Fab' goat anti-rat immunoglobulin (GARG), Fl IgG, F(ab'), and Fab*
BN anti-Lewis alloantibody (RT1), F(ab), rabbit anti-rat y chain
(RAG) and Fl-F{ab*), goat anti-mouse IqgG°(GAM) have been deserihed
(Woda and Feldman, ¢979, Woda, et. a1., 1979). Monoclonal mouse
anti-rat thy-3, MRC OX-7, (Mason and Williams, 1980) was a gift of
Dr. A. Williams. Alloantibody specitic for thy-1 (AKR/CUM anti-
AKR/J) was a gift of Dr. A. Altman. FI-F(ab'), and Fi-Fab' anti-
thy-1 were prepared by previously published methods (Woda, et. al.,
1979).

Cell Staining

SIg - For capping experiments, spleen cells or thymocytes were
stained with 200 ug/ml F1l-F(ab'), GARG for 30 min on ice and washed
two times. For FRAP experiments“spleen cells were stained with 400
ug/ml Fl-Fab' GARG or 100 ug/ml FI-F(ab"), GARG.

RT1- For capping experiments, spleen cells were stained with 300
ug/ml FY antieRT? foliowed Ly 250 ug/ml RAG. For FRAP experiments,
spleen cells were stained with 400 ug/l Fl-Fab’ anti-RT! or 100-400
ug/ml FI-F(ab"), anti-RTl.

Thy-1 - For capping experiments thymocytes were incubated with
1:2400 monoclonal anti-thy-1 or 1:40 alloanti-thy-1 followed by 150
ug/ml Ft-F(ab*)., GAM. For FRAP experiments, cells were stained with
50 ug/ml Fl-Fab* monoclonal ant i-thy-) or 50 ug/ml Fl-F(ab‘)., or 50
ug/ml FI-F(ab"), anti-thy-1 followed by 125 ug/m? F(ab"), GAR.

Capping and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP)

Studies were done as previously described (Woda and Feldman, 1979;
Woda, et. al., 1979; Woda, et. al., 1980). The % capped cells =
tapped cells/fluorescent cells x 100. 0D represents the diffusion
coefficient and the percentage recovery (% R) represents the mobile
fraction of fluorophore.
