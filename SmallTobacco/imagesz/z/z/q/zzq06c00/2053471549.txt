Subject: Minutes of Meeting on NO Concentration Modification and Document
Availability

 

On 17 November a meeting was held to develop ideas on modifying the concentration of NO in
mainstream smoke. The following issues were discussed:-

1. Nitrate in tobacco as the principal source of NO in smoke.

2. General methods identified in existing patents and literature.

3. The impact of cigarette dilution on smoke component concentrations.
4, Existing patents

5. Results of a Central File search on this topic.

It was felt that discussions should be resumed once there has been an opportunity to review the
existing patents and literature. To this purpose the result of a recent search is attached to this
memo. The complete set of documents, patents, internal memos and reports, and some external
articles has been assembled and is available in Central File, see either Michele Thomas or Mary
Satterfield and refer to the "NO" File. This set can be borrowed for review, but no internal

document should not be copied. If you require a personal copy of any of these documents please
request it through Central File or the Patent Group.

In order to give everyone an opportunity to review the existing level of knowledge the next
meeting will be held on January 11 from 9-11 in ---- conference room.
