Another Concept/Product Test is in field to evaluate products containing
Colgate-type (spearmint) flavors in the same controlled release
technology. The 5% menthol product was included in this test to obtain a
second read and to give a baseline for comparing the spearmint products.

Qualitative research was conducted the week of 11/9/87 on these spearmint-
type products. The respondents had received two packs of product prior to
the groups for in-home trial. The reception of these products was
overwhelmingly positive.

This technology appears to provide the consumer benefits of fresh
aftertaste in cigarette products. Efforts are continuing to refine the
aftertaste flavors with both IFF and Quest. PT&D is currently developing
a pellet insertion machine for use in Manufacturing. The controlled
release flavor complex is being refined to optimize handling and flavor
delivery characteristics.

The technology is also currently being evaluated as a product
characteristic of the TF product, which has active new brand status.
