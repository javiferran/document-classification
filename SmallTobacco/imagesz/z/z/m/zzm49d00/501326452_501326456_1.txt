MO. Watson -?- April 27, 1972

d. "Kodak Camera" General Media Promotion (No MRD # assigned yet)
MRD will do redemption analysis. The question of testing
for the advertising value of this promotion was discussed,
but MRD pointed out that it was too late to test the
successfulness of achieving this promotion's objectives.
Testing will be done on future media promotions instead.

e. Winnebago Camper & Trail Bike Sweepstakes ("B" Promotion)
(MRD # 72-0275) It was agreed that in addition to

redemption analysis, consumer follow-up will be conducted
by MRD after drawing of the winner. It will consist of
about 300-500 respondents to determine competitive trial
and demographic composition of the entrants, but that's
all. A proposal is’ to be prepared for this.

Interest was expressed by the Brand Group in the influence

of the motorcycle prize upon the composition of the

entrants, especially younger age groups. Also, MRD was

asked to keep in mind that almost 20% of the U. S. population
was excluded from full salesforce effort on this promotion.
