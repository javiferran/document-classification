Mr. J. O. Watson

Re: WINSTON BRAND GROUP AND MRD SALES PROMOTION PLANNING MEETING

To recap our meeting of Monday, April 17, 1972, here is a summary
of the topics covered:

1. Change in Marketing Objectives of WINSTON Promotions -
Primarily due to the high level of smoker trial, WINSTON
already enjoys (about 70% of all smokers), "attainment of
competitive trial" has now been given secondary status.

In its place as primary objectives are now:

a. Achieve visibility for the Brand at point-of-sale, and

b. Reinforce the Brand's major selling points to consumers
at point-of-sale. In addition,

C. "Reward current smokers of WINSTON" remains a primary
promotion objective.

2. Review of Current Promotions -

a. Hi-Lo Baseball Sweepstakes Promotion Evaluation Report Pp"

(MRD # 71-0221). The report on this promotion
has been released. ,

b. WINSTON Menthol 50¢ Coupon Direct Mail Test (MRD #71-0476) oe
The research currently being completed on this offer
appears to be sufficient: redemption analysis, sales

analysis, and consumer follow-up to determine competitive
trial and demographic composition.

C. "Real-Rich-Cool" Negro Sweepstakes (MRD # 72-0230) ow
The research currently under way appears sufficient: ,€

redemption analysis and an estimate of the multiple
entry rate.

There was some discussion on the need for research into
why "scaled down" promotions which are aimed at specific
market segments seem to attract fewer participants with
a higher cost per entry. Several alternatives were
suggested: ,
i. Ballot testing
ii. Focus group sessions
iii. Experimental techniques for identifying

which one - of several - alternative
sweepstakes smokers would prefer to
enter.
