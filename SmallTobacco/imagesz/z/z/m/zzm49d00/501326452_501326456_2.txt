It was requested that evaluation of the promotion include
redemption analysis, multiple entry analysis, an analysis
of the demographic composition of the entries for each

of the 6 prizes, and an evaluation of the relative consumer
appeal of each of the six prizes, since the Brand Group is
very interested in the potential use of some or all of

the six as a national self-liquidator.

There will be some limited media support in some, but

not all, of the sélf-liquidator states via Sunday supplement
ads only. Normally, self-liquidators offered at point-of-
sale in non-sweepstakes states do not receive media support.
The Brand Group will send MRD a schedule of the placement
and timing of this media support for the self-liquidator
states, and for the sweepstakes states... ©

MRD requested that the Brand Group or Sales Promotion have
separate P. O. Box numbers for both sweepstakes and self-
liquidator entries such that distinctions can be made as
to whether an entry came from point-of-sale displays, or
from media, in each of the two groups of states. The
Brand Group will send MRD a list of the box numbers, and
MRD can therf prepare proposals for this research.

November-December, 1972: A counter display only (no
floor promotions) will be selected. Since the nature
of this promotion has not been determined, research
requirements will be discussed at a later date.
