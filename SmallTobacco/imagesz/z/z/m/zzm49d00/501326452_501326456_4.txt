a. T-Scope Testing.- This technique was discussed as a means
of pre-testing alternative promotion artwork (such as
riser cards, and promotion ads) or special-event related
banners carrying WINSTON logos (such as "Welcome Rodeo,
Racing, or Bowling Fans"). This research will be
conducted in May on alternative Rodeo banners.

As a reminder, let's include space for telephone numbers

assigned, etc.

If you have any questions or changes to be made, please call.
