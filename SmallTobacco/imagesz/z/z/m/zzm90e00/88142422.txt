All Concerned

J. R. Ave

The following will be released to the press today:

Lorillard, Inc. announced today that the KENT cigarettes
advertising account has been assigned to Batten, Barton,
Durstine & Osborne, Inc.

KENT advertising was previously handled by Foote, Cone
& Belding, New York.

J. Robert Ave, President and CEO of Lorillard, Inc. fit
said, "It is with both regret and great anticipation

that we make the announcement of this change. FCB has

been our stalwart partner for many years. They have

helped us when at times we could not find the way to

help ourselves. BBDO receives an account which has

been professionally managed and we are eager to work

with them in the further development of our KENT

business."
