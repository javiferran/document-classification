Re: WINSTON 100's "X", 16 mg Tar Unannounced Shipment Test

March 17, 1978

The purpose of this document is to outline the current status and
proposed timetable for unannounced shipment test of the WINSTON
100's 16 mg product.

Background

The WINSTON 100's Improved Product program was initiated in February,
1977, when NFO results determined that the current product was less
preferred to Marlboro in blind testing. Test results showed that
female WINSTON 100's smokers and all Marlboro smokers preferred
Marlboro 100's over WINSTON 100's. ‘The primary reason for WINSTON's
lack of preference was its being perceived "too strong/harsh" "less
smooth/mild" relative to Marlboro.

Accordingly, three lowered-tar blends were developed which were
judged to be milder than current WINSTON 100's. It was intended
that one of the products would be introduced into an "announced"

test market if it met the required action standards, which have since
been modified. The new "announcement" action standards specify:

* Significant preference over current among WINSTON smokers.

-

* Significant preference over Marlboro among WINSTON smokers.
(Additional element)

* parity or better vs. Marlboro among Marlboro and B&H smokers.
(Same blend used in Marlboro and B&H)

* preference over Marlboro among other NFF smokers.

* preference to be maximized versus females, the primary target
for the 100mm NFF category.

* TPM at 17 mgs or less.

Test Results

Blend #2 demonstrated significant advantages over current WINSTON

100's, although the blend did not fully meet the action standards

for “announcement” test market. Test results indicated that blend
#2 was:
