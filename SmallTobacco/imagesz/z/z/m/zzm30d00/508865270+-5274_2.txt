Test Markets

MRD has recommended test and control markets which are suitable
for shipment testing. The markets are characterized by similar
WINSTON 100's SOM and total WINSTON SOM. MRD indicates that both
provide sufficient volume for WINSTON 100's to be read with
confidence.

The Sales Department has evaluated trade spillage in the test
divisions and indicates that 90% of the product at retail in the
divisions will be test product.

perforated tipping, plug wrap, and other modifications to produce
the new product. Additional shipments of 221.3MM units (1.4% over
current 1978 forecast) must be achieved to pay back the incremental
