Measurement August, 1977
Blend #2 16.0 mg -
Curr. WINSTON 100's' 19.7 mg 19.0 mg.

Primary reasons for preference for blend #2 versus comparison
products were perceived mildness, less strength, and less
harshness, particularly among the target group of women and
older smokers.

Based on blend #2's demonstrated improvements over current WINSTON
100's, Brand Management has recommended shipment test of the blend.
The test objective is to confirm in-market consumer acceptance
versus the current product and the competition. If test results

are positive, the blend may serve as a reduced tar-level replacement
nationally for current WINSTON 100's until a blend meeting the
"announcement" criteria is developed.
