Traffic

Traffic will substitute the new product for current WINSTON 100's

in the Minneapolis and Huntsville warehouses to expedite product
availability at retail. The cases for the new product will be

marked WINSTON 100's "X" to distinguish it from current WINSTON 100's.

Research

MRD will develop a sales trend for the test market on a pretest
basis and forecast the trend for the test period (six to nine
months). Actual shipments will be compared with projected shipments
in the test and control divisions via a mathematical model to
determine the impact of the test blend on sales.

In addition, MRD will conduct a consumer study in the test market
to analyze consumer product perceptions of WINSTON 100's prior to
and following shipment of the test product. Perceptions from the
test market will be compared to smoker perceptions of current
WINSTON 100's in the control market. In each market, smokers will
be asked if they noticed a change in the product. Smokers noticing
a change will be asked to evaluate the change and give reasons for
preference.
