Weekly means of body weight, food consumption and food con-
Sumption relative to body weight are plotted as function

of time. These parameters were statistically tested for
significant deviation between the groups.

Use of different sized animal tubes is tabulated and shown
in diagrams for all groups as function of time.

Results of microbiological tests, included general hygienic

controls and tests of food-, air- and water-samples are shown in tables.

Methods and schedules applied to measure the reported data
are summarized in chapter 2.
