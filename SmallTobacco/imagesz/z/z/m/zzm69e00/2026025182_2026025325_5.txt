1. INTRODUCTION

Biological effects of two types of cigarettes were to be com-
pared in a long-term inhalation Study with male rats under
SPF-conditions. The cigarettes differ in their tobacco formula:
the cigarette being tested is filled with et-tobacco;

the reference cigarette is filled with net-tobacco.

There are 2 inhalation groups per cigarette type. Exposure
times per session are 15 min for groups 15.1-GR° (et- tobacco) ©
and 15.2-GR (net-tobacco). Groups 35.1-GR (et-tobacco) and
35.2-GR (net-tobacco) are exposed for 35 min per session.
Each group. receives 5 exposure sessions per day,

7 days per week.

Each inhalation group and an additional sham smoking group
contains 120 rats.

The smoke-air dilution ratio was chosen to result in an almost
identical TPM-concentration fior each inhalation group.

This volume contains biological data for days 400 to 600 of the
smoking period.

Data of mortality, body length and femur length are tabulated for

each group. Body weight and food consumption are tabulated for
each group together with weekly mean values and the resulting
relative standard deviation.

Differences in mortality, body length and femur length between
different groups were tested for statistical significance.
