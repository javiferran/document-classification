Cigarette industry price elasticity is estimated at .35. when
the “real price" (retail price divided by the CPI) increases by
1.0%, industry volume declines .35%.

Since mid-1981, the real price of cigarettes has been
increasing and industry volume has been declining.

The 1983 Federal Excise Tax increase caused a sharp rise in
real prices with a corresponding drop in industry volune.

The accelerated volume decline in 1989 reflects the impact of
higher real prices resulting from higher manufacturers’ price
increases ($2.50 per thousand in December 1988 and June 1989)
together with excessive state tax hikes (averaging 15¢ per
pack in 31% of the country).

number of Americans who smoke is decreasing.

There are about 48 million smokers in the U.S. Annually
during the 1980’s, the number of quitters (about 1.5 million)
has exceeded the number of new adult smokers (about 800
thousand), resulting in a net loss of about 700 thousand
(~2%).

Increasing prices and the negative external environment tend
to accelerate this decline by increasing quitting and
reducing the number of new smokers.

The main source of business to help offset losses from quitters
is younger adult smokers (ages 18-24), .

The 800 thousand new smokers who enter the adult market each
year represent about 1.6 share points. At least 95% of these
new smokers are under 25.

Younger adult smokers represent 13% of the total smoker
population. Their daily consumption rate is lower than
average(25 cigarettes per day compared to 31 for total 18+).
Thus, they smoke about 60 billion cigarettes annually.

The only full priced brands in the industry that are not
declining are those which are stronger among younger adult
smokers than older smokers, i.e., brands which attract more
new smokers than they lose to quitcing.
