INDUSTRY

Brand switching, when defined as a change in purchase loyalty
from one usual brand to another, involves 4% to 8% of total
volume annually.

° The net switching benefit to any single brand is usually
quite small, especially for full-price brands.

Occasional use of non-usual brands is common and can generate
short-term brand sales benefits from, for example, price
promotion.

Brand loyalty continues to drive the cigarette market, although
it is being lessened by a number of factors now present in the
marketplace:

° Increasing price sensitivity.

. Proliferation of brands and styles.

e Heavy use of retail promotions.

e Health and social acceptability concerns.

The savings segment currently represents 16% of the market, up
from 13% in 1988. It is the only segment currently showing
significant switching gains and is expected to comprise xx%t of
industry volume in 1990.

e The category had its beginning with Liggett’s introduction of
Plain generic products in 1980, but is now dominated by
generic-priced branded entries from R. J. Reynolds and Philip
Morris.

The current average retail price of branded generics is
$10.60 per carton, about $2.40 or 18% lower than full priced
brands.

A sub-generic "third tier" price level emerged in 1989 with
Liggett’s introduction of Pyramid, priced at retail about
$2.40 per carton less than branded savings entries.

- Generally, the wholesale trade has not been receptive to
third tier price brands, citing low margins, billing
confusion and lack of the manufacturer’s sales force
support.

Many major chains have rejected Pyramid because they have
their own house generic brands, but some smaller chains
have accepted it to compete with major chains’ private
label products.

With continuing escalation of retail prices, growth of the
savings segment is expected to continue. It is projected to
represent XX% of the market in 1990, and could grow to xx%
by 1993.
