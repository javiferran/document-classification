Smokers’ wants differ by their demographic and social situation. wants also
change over time, as external factors change.

Younger adult smokers choose brands based on a combination of taste and
image. Historically, they prefer mild, smooth products which are
pesitioned to smoking enjoyment. These have tended to be the solo
menthol or non-menthol brands such as WINSTON, Marlboro, Kool, or
Newport. Peer acceptability is their main criterion for brand image.

Black smokers show an overwhelming preference for menthol, the choice of

nearly 90% of Blacks 18-24. However, menthol has declined steadily
among most other smokers.

Older smokers (25+) are more attuned to smoking "problems" and may
switch in large numbers to brands which offer a "solution" for the
concern of the times. Major examples include filter cigarettes in the
1950’s (WINSTON, SALEM), “low tar” in the 1970’s (VANTAGE, Merit,
Carlton, NOW), and price in the 1980's (DORAL, Cambridge).

Price will continue to be an issue in the 1990’s. Social acceptability

is also a current problem for smokers, but no manufacturer has yet
offered a widely accepted solution.
