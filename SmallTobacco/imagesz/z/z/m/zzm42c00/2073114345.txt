PHILIP MORRIS USA INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

FROM: Natalie Ellis

SUBJECT: Promotional Lift Analysis

Attached is the most recent Marlboro promotion analysis. It contains the lift numbers
for the March price off. As } explained on the phone, the analysis uses statistical
modeling to estimate weekly share lifts in stores carrving the promotion in a given
week. li does not measure the total market performance of the promotion. The reason
for modeling is to allow comparison of promotions on an “all else being equal” basis.
Needless to say, in the marketplace all else is rarely aqual. Still 1 hope this is useful.
