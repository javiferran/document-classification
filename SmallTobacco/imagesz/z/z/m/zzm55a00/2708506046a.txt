Hi Dwight,

All the numbers for stage 2 sign-off match with the exception of Marlboro. The Monarch
counts for Marlboro are higher than the Brio counts. I think that's kind of weird. Can
you help Brian with this? Could it have anything te de with Marlboro looking at 200 and
900 series program numbers? I don't know but it doesn't seem right that only one brand's
numbers are different.

Hi,

Attached, please find the documents fer approval Stage 2 of the Selection

documents.

Provided is a report run far the past 19 months which simulates the DB2
report in the “comparison binder" and the numbers compare favorably.

Also provided is a sgl verification script and calculation verifications
that verify against the data in the Monarch database.

Please fill out the attached form and return by 7/25.
Thanks.
