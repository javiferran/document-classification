Subject: RE: YSP Plant Cmty communication

fyi, here is info i received about Richmond MC's PMT/FLT meetings; still waiting on Park 500:

The MC's combined PMT/FLT meetings are scheduled on an "as-needed" basis. We are holding 2 in
September, but they are dedicated to "Creating the Future".

With reasonable advance notice, we will be happy to arrange a PMT/FLT Meeting to accommodate
YSP during 4th Quarter, 1999. The PMT is scheduled to meet on the dates below, from 8:00 a.m. to

12:00 noon. if one of these windows meets NY needs, then we could expand the meeting to include
the FLT:

Oct. 14
Oct. 21
Oct. 28
Nov. 4
Nov. 11
Nov. 18
Dec. 2
Dec. 9
Dec. 16

Alternative dates can also be arranged. At least this will give you a place to start! (If NY would like to

suggest several dates that are convenient for them, | will gladly follow up to make arrangements on
this end.)

Thanks, Sally
