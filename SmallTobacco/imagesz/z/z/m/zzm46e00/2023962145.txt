IS EPA BLOWING ITS OWN SMOKE?

How Much Science Is Behind Its Tobacco Finding?

By Michael Fumento
In Los Angeles.

“Taken together, the total
weight of evidence is conclusive
that environmental tobacco
smoke increases the risk of lung
cancer in nonsmokers.”

So declared Environmental! Protec-
tion. Agency: Administrator William
Reilly at.a news conference earlier this
month, announcing the impending re-
lease of an: EPA: reporti attributing
approximately. 3,000: deaths a year to
passive smoking, or environmental
tobacco smoke.

Yet many in the scientific and! medi-
cal community say the data the EPA
cites does not bear out its conclusion.

While’ virtually: all. scientists agree
that smoking is unhealthful — both for
smokers and those around them — it’s
the degree. to which smoking is un-
healthfyl|_and the way the government
mustérs its scientific case, that raises
questions.

Some scientists andi policy analysts
who say. they. couldn'ti care less about
tobacco company profits or even the
rights. of smokers: are worrying aloud
that the EPA report is paving the way
for:justifying new health-based'govern-
mentiregulations and'programs without
any real science behind them.

Watch based in Chantilly, Va., “It's
now. open season on whatever contami-
nant the EPA chooses to label the killer
contaminant of the week, with the effect
that once again, Americans are going to
be. stampeded into fearing:a: substance
for reasons which upon close inspection:
are scientifically indefensible.’

Yale University epidemiologistiAlvan:
Feinstein, writing in the journal Toxico-
logical Pathology, said he recently
heard a prominentileader in epidemio-
logy admit of the BPA‘s work on
passive smoking: “Yes, it’s rotten’ sci-
ence, but it’s in a worthy cause. Iti will
help us to get rid of cigarettes and to:
become a smoke-free society.”

Another criuc, Alfred P. Webiner,
presidenti of Biomedical and Environ-
mental Consultants Inc., in Richland,
Wash., said: “I did work for the EPA in
the: past and. thoughti of them rea-
sonably well, but. when I saw. that
report, I was really embarrassed. It was
a bad document”

One thing both sides: agree on is that
the direct policy ramifications of the
EPA report could be tremendous.

“You can bet your next: paycheck
that OSHA (the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration) will ban all
smoking in the workplace,”” said John
Shanahan, the environmental policy
analyst atithe Heritage Foundation.

Although, in unveiling the report.
Reilly expressly referred to: cancer in
children and in the workplace, the
statistical! analysis in the EPA report
actually ignored the studies that looked
forisuch links.

Rather, the EPA survey. is based' on
II! American studies of spouses of.
smokers. The report discussed, but' did
not. put into its statistical analysis, the
results of 19 other studies done outside
the U.S.

In its analysis ofithose 11 studies, the
EPA. found that there was a “statisti-
cally significant” difference in the num-
ber of lung cancers. suffered by. non-
smoking spouses of smokers, equal to
119-such cancers in nonsmoking spouses
of smokers compared to 100 lung:
cancers in nonsmoking spouses of non-
smokers.

This finding of statistical significance
allowed it to rank passive smoking as a:
Class. A carcinogen, the highest risk
ranking possible.

Statistical! significance, while sound-
ing like arcane academic talk, is actually
quite important. It is used to account for
the possibility that something happened
— inthis case the (9. additional | lung
cancers — by.chance.

But critics say, that, using its. own
previous statistical standards, the EPA
reportishows no such significance.

“Frankly, I was embarrassed! as a
scientist with what they came up with.
The main. problem was. the statistical
handling: ofi the: data,” said Wehner,
who headed a panel/ of scientists. and
doctors that analyzed the drafti version
of the EPA report! for the tobacco
industry.

‘Meta-Analysis’

One aspect of this problem, say.
critics, involves the combination of the
11 studies into one. big group — what
the EPA called a “meta-analysis.”

The EPA: has never before. done this.
Critics say such combinations may. be
valid, but if the. studies .weren’t done in
the same. way, the results: will be like
comparing apples and oranges and
pears.

Not everyone agrees.

“Meta-analysis is totally fair,” said
Stanton Glantz of the Institute of
Health Policy Studies at the University,
of California, San Ftancisco.."I review.
reports like that for the. State of Califor-
nia, and the work the. EPA: did is
absolutely firsti rate,, one of the best
pieces of science I've seen about' any-
thing.”

But Wehner said the study was faulty.

“To get scientificaily valid data, there
are very strict rulés and requirements on
how and when you can apply’ meta-
analysis, and virtually.all of them were
violated in the EPA analysis,” he said.

‘Confidence Intervals’

The 11 studies together actually
reflected 10 studies that showed no
stalistically significanti increases in can-
cer and only one that did. When the
EPA says that the weight of! 11 studies
showed harm from passive smoking, it
really meant one positive combined with
10 neutrals.

More important than the use of the
meta-analysis, say critics, is the EPA’s
use, also for the first time, of a less
rigorous statistical analysis.

Epidemiologists — those who study
disease and accident: patterns to estab-
lish why they occur — calculate ‘*confi-
dénce intervals’ to express the
likelihood that a result could have
happened strictly. by chance.

A 95% confidence interval means that
there is a 95% possibility that the result
didn’t happen: from chance, or a 5%
possibility thatit did.

Until the passive smoking report, the
EPA has always used 2.95% confidence
interval, as have most researchers doing:
epidemiological studies. Indeed, all. of
the individual ETS studies were pub-
lished with 95% confidence intervals..

Yet). in. its averaging of those ETS
studies, the EPA decided'to go witha
90% confidence interval.

“That doubles the chance ofi being
wrong,” explained James Enstrom, a
professor of epidemiology at the Uni:
versity of California, Los Angeles.

Reilly said simply: “With respect to
the confidence interval, we have here.a
90% confidence level. And that was, in
fact,, what was recommended to us by
the scientific community as appropriate
to this data.” Repeated calls to the EPA
to find out who in the scientific commu:
nity had done so went unanswered. .

‘Hairsplitting’ Factor

Glantz said ithe criticism of the change
in the confidence. level is a: kindi of
“hairsplitting that. only: professors care.
about.”

Many ‘epidemiologists, however, dis-
agree.

“In mosti cases, a scientist would
never do this sort of thing,’’’ Enstrom
said. “It's surprising that they would try
to get away. with it.”

The bottom line is that such “‘Hairs-
plitting” allowed the EPA to come toa
totally, different conclusion than it
wouldi have using
its normal method.

It could now de-
clare that the re-
sults of the
American studies,
when lumped to-
gether, were ‘‘sta-
tistiecally
significant,” a term
of great impor-
tance. to the medi-
cal community. At
a 95% confidence
