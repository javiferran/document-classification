Tobacco samples collected from under the Tobaccoville C&D dryer apron,
which were analyzed by RAD, ravealed the presence of the chemica) °
2-butoxyethanol. Witco-Co::“information. on theKelgrafel200-o11e.
indicated the presance of .5% glycol -athers-that.are.added.for chatni
cleaning. Scientific Affairs has ‘stated that "use of this off in.
aveas where it will coma into direct contact with tobacco or is likely
to contaminate tobacco indirectly should ba.discontinued",-

Ms. Carolyn Rahn contacted Witco Co. and discussed -alternative-chain

the scheduled pressure washing of the feeder chains greatly reduces: 926 93
the need for the chain cleaner package and (2) that the investigation

administrative controls,

Witco Co. ts sending me a 3-1/2 gallon sample of th, <or ‘Chain |
lubricant to test. Since 601 WP has the wash system Thstallad on
their dryers, I would propose the tasting be conducted at that plant.
The two (2) parameters that can be monitored for comparison are: |
