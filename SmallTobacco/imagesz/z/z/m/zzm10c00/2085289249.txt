Jack,

Joe Bickett will be presenting the attached update on the revision to the QS Standard at Friday 6/29's OBT meeting. | just
went over it this moming with Judy, so it's now a "mature draft”. Will you please review at your earliest convenience and
get your comments back to Joe Bickett? (I will be on vacation for the next two weeks, but | would appreciate a copy of
your commenis, even though it will be after the fact.}

Thanks so much for your help!!
