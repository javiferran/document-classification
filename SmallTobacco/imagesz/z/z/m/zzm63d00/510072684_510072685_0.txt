RJR Interoffice Memorandum

SUBJECT: Proposal to HRRC for Sensory DATE: March 10, 1989
Evaluation of Vantage Excel
100 Cigarettes Prepared with
Low Sidestream Paper Containing
Boron

TO: Dr. John H. Reynolds, IV FROM: Patricia F. Perfetti

I would appreciate consideration by you and the HRRC of the following proposal
to request consumers to smoke Vantage Excel 100 and one test VRP prototype
prepared with cigarette wrappers containing low levels of boron.

Background:

Vantage Excel 100 entered test market January 31, 1989. Although consumers
are very enthusiastic about the taste and product concept, numerous written
and verbal complaints have been received by RJRT regarding the "messy,
fly-away nature of the ash". It is paramount that the ash be improved
immediately to insure the success of the brand. Two prototypes (described
below) have been prepared with modified VRP low sidestream paper with the
intent of improving ash cohesiveness.

Need For Human Subjects:

Unbiased human subjects are required in order to determine if the ash
improvements demonstrated by either prototype are significant enough to be
noticed by the typical consumer.

Scientific Affairs Review:

 

Memorandum attached (Rhenda Steele to Pat Perfetti, March 10, 1989). The
conclusion is that boric acid and sodium tetraborate decahydrate are approved
for further review by the HRRC. Also, attached is information from the U.K.
Independent Scientific Committee on Smoking and Health (Fourth Report, 1988).
