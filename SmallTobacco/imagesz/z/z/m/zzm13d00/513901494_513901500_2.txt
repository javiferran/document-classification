ABOUT THE EPA REPORT

EPA Report Sparks Antismoking Plans:
Plaintiffs’ Suits May Prod Firms To Bar
Smoking — The [EPA] is counting mainly
on plaintiffs lawyers, rather than regula-
tors, to drive businesses to ban smoking
on their premises, and ihe iawyers are
eager to comply. As a result of the EPA's
report linking ‘passive’ tobacco smoke to
lung cancer and other ailments, a new
wave of tobacco-related lawsuits is likely.
Wall Street Journal

“No one would grant his neighbor the right
to blow tiny amounts of asbestos into a
room or sprinkle traces of pesticide onto
food. By the same logic, smokers have no
right to spew even more noxious clouds
into the air around them. The next step
has to be a searching examination of how
to tighten restrictions on smoking in ail
public places, and the workplace as well."
New York Times

"More and more the owners or operators
of public facilities like the Orioles are send-
ing tobacco smoke the way of flaking
asbestos — and for the same reason. It
kills innocent people." Baltimore Sun

"Smoking is being slowly pushed farther
and farther out of public places. Given the
findings on passive smoking, smokers and
non-smokers should cooperate to extend
the process to private places as well."
Albuquerque Journal

“if indoor smoking isn't curbed, some
people who think they've been put at risk
by secondhand smoke may wind up taking
their complaints to court."
