THE EPA HAS ACTED — NOW IT’S YOUR TURN!
Dear Friends,

The just-released EPA Report is an important new weapon
in the war to protect nonsmokers’ rights. As many have request-
ed, we've made it available in a form you can use wherever you:

Work

Eat out

Have your hair cut, your car repaired, or
Visit an office or other workplace.

The EPA Report concludes that secondhand tobacco smoke
is a "Group A carcinogen" like asbestos, and that it causes
serious health problems for millions of children every year.

ASH worked hard to protect the report from tobacco-
industry sabotage. We succeeded: the interrogations of EPA staff
by the tobacco industry ceased, and the secret EPA compendium on
the dangers was made available to the public.

Now, like you, we want to be sure that we make the most
of this dynamite report. THAT’S WHY WE REALLY NEED YOUR HELP.

ASH will be using the EPA Report to help persuade
legislators to ban — not just restrict — smoking in public
places. Some already have, but WE NEED YOUR HELP IN REACHING.
MORE OF THEM.

ASH is also informing businesses — including fast-food
restaurants, airlines, and others — about the EPA report. But
often its conclusions must be brought to their attention person-
ally before they will act. This is especially true of small and
local businesses. THAT’S ONE REASON WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP NOW!

So ASH has taken the major findings of the report and
added legal threats and additional arguments for businesses to
ban smoking. Then we combined them all in a brochure for OUR
SUPPORTERS TO MAIL, POST, AND — MOST IMPORTANTLY — HAND OUT!

We know that even this brief brochure can be very
effective, but only if it is placed in the hands of decision-
makers across the country. THAT’S WHERE YOU COME IN!
