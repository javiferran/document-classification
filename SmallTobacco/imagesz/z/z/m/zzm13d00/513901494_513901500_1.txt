Please take just a few minutes to copy the enclosed
brochure on a copier. Or, you can write ASH for additional
copies. Then we suggest that you:

™@ Give one to the owner or manager every time you dine out,
especially in fast-food restaurants.

m™ Distribute it where you get your hair cut, your clothes
cleaned, your car repaired, or receive any other service.

m Pass out a copy at day-care centers, bowling alleys, ar-
cades, and other places where children congregate.

™ Send it [anonymously if necessary] to your supervisor and to
other decisionmakers at your place of work.

m Make it available to your nonsmoking friends, relatives, co-
workers, and members of your church and social clubs.

m Use it — wherever and whenever — to educate people about the
need to protect themselves from secondhand tobacco smoke.

We also ask that you take just a moment to help ASH
another way: by sending a generous check.

The costs of educating business and legislators about
the report, of suing to make OSHA act on it, and of countering
the tobacco industry’s big lies designed to discredit it are
enormous. ASH CANNOT DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE — AND WHAT WE KNOW
YOU WANT DONE — WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

The EPA has given nonsmokers a tremendously powerful
new weapon. But, LIKE ANY OTHER WEAPON, IT HAS TO BE BROUGHT TO
THE FRONT LINES AND FIRED. Otherwise, it is useless. The weapon
is wasted. And your lungs will be the losers!

So, please use this weapon ASH has,crafted from the EPA
report. And please make sure, with your check, that ASH has the
funds to use the EPA Report in legal and legislative proceedings.

Your efforts now — today — can help protect your health
tomorrow, and for many tomorrows to come.

Please help as if your life depended on it. It might —
SECONDHAND TOBACCO SMOKE KILLS MORE INNOCENT PEOPLE EACH YEAR
THAN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS, GUNS, AIDS, OR ILLICIT DRUGS!
