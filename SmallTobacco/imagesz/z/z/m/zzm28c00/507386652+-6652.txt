RE: Marlboro Media Plan

Attached is an excellent compilation of Marlboro's 1986 media plan and
key learning/conclusions relative to this formidable competitor's
media strategies/tactics, The information was compiled and analyzed
by Gabe Gabriel and is illustrated in a standard RJR plan deck format.

As Gabe concludes, Marlboro's media activity is extraordinarily broad
and extensive - a mass media schedule befitting a dominant~share brand
with appeal transcending focused demographic parameters.

Importantly, it appears the media schedule is not designed to address
Marlboro's FUBYA strength but, rather, to maintain its ubiquitous
presence against total smokers, thereby defending its business against
smokers likely to switch out of the franchise,

This strategy is similar to RJR's in that neither Marlboro nor RJR
primarily concentrate efforts against franchise smokers. The key
difference is the direction in which the brands view their opportunity
segments, Marlboro's focus appears to be franchise maintenance as
their smokers grow older in age. Conversely, RJR's focus is against
younger adult smokers who may be brought into the franchise.

Opportunity = Convert Base Opportunity = Maintain
Opportunity = vonvert a penne ~PP y

 

Marlboro Franchise ———~—------> _ Older Adult
Smokers
Younger Adult ——-~—~--> RJR Brands Franchise
Smokers

With your approval, next steps are to distribute Gabe's analysis to
the CAMEL, WINSTON and MAGNA Brand Groups, as well as Media Planning,
for their review and an enlightening look at the specific tactical
activity behind Marlboro's known high spending levels.

Let us know if you would Jike to discuss.
