Subject: Mass Spectral Analysis of Residue from ART Pilot Plant

GC-MS analysis was performed on a sample of residue obtained from the
reactor at the ART pilot plant. This sample was originally submitted by
Jose Nepomuceno, request code 289095, sample code Z9DS. The sample was
taken up in hexane and analyzed by GC-MS using the JEOL SX 102 mass
spectrometer. A 15 meter, DB-5, 0.25 um column was used with conditions of
initial temperature 100°C, heating rate of 10°/min., and final temperature
of 325°C with a ten minute hold time. The mass spectrometer was operated in
the electron impact mode (EI) with 70 eV ionization potential, 10 Kev
acceleration and a scan speed of 1 scan/sec over the mass range 0-800.

Figure 1 shows the total ion chromatogram for the sample. Important
components include: hexane solvent (scan 67), neophytadiene (scan 516),
(18,2E,4R, 7E,11E) -2,7,11-cembratriene-4, 6-diol (scan 746) and a number of
long-chained hydrocarbons in the region of 950-1300. Although most of the
components in the region of scan 950-1300 are long-chained hydrocarbon
waxes, there are two notable exceptions. The first is the component
observed at scan 1158 which has a structure that likely contains a
substructure with aromatic character and an aliphatic chain. The second is
the component observed at scan 1205 which appears to have a cholestane type
structure. Absolute identification of these compounds has not been
acheived.

Comparison of this material to ART materials analyzed previously
reveals no components unique to this residue (see memo: Mass
Spectral Analyses of ART Samples to D. Leyden, from N. Jensen 9/22/89). If
one compares this material to solid material obtained as residue from higher
pressure ART runs, the major difference is in relative distribution of
various components. For this residue sample, the abundances of
neophytadiene, the cembratrienediol and the cholestane type compound are
increased with respect to the abundances of the hydrocarbons as compared to
ART solid material analyzed previously. There are also some differences in
relative distribution within the hydrocarbon region.

The total ion chromatogram for the sample is attached and mass spectra
have been obtained for all components indicated in the TIC. If you need
additional information or have questions please contact me.
