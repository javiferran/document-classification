7. 10/26/94 - Dr. Vello Norman requested that tne unknown paper
additive in the cigarette paper of Salem Preferred 100mm and
Salem Preferred Lights 100mm test products be identified.
RUR, the manufacturer of the preferred cigarettes, claims
that “the cigarettes use a paper treated with a common food
additive which reduces the odor of cigarette smoke and gives
a smoother taste". RJR has not disclosed the identity of
the additive. J. JOHNSON, A. PRAKASH, 8. J. CRAVEN,

ACTIVITY ON PROJECTS:

ANALYTICAL SERVICES PROJECT (Q-449):
Effect of Diammonium Phosphate on Nicotine Delivery

Dick Striegel worked with Product Development to prepare test
cigarettes made with tobacco containing various levels of
diammonium phosphate (DAP). DAP levels ranged from 0% to 3.0%.
The following analyses were performed: “Smoking Lab" analysis;
"Leaf Lab" analyses, burn rate analysis and smoke pH analysis.

Dick Striegel compiled the data, evaluated the results and
included a complete set of data in the 10/4/94 memo. As a result
of this study, Dick concluded that the CPM (corrected particulate
matter) and nicotine yields per puff and hence the nicotine to
CPM ratios were not affected by increased levels of diammonium
phosphate.

NIR Analysis of Plasticizer

Bill Deaton is interested in using a NIR (near infrared) system
to determine plasticizer on filter tow. Rob Stevens evaluated
the system and its possible use as an on-line measuring device to
control the percent plasticizer applied to tow.

Review of Funding Recipients

Jennifer Johnson assisted Dan Heck in the review of an applicant
as a recipient of AIRC funds. After examining the research work
and publications of this applicant, Jennifer recommended that
they not be funded.
