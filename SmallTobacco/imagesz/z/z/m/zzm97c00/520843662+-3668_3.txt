Name

We only include smokers on our list who have at least one character in their first name
and two or more characters in their last name. We reject any records that do not meet
this criteria.

Usual Brand/Second Usual Brand

Research and program results indicate that Usual Brand information from Brand sources
is more biased than information from Blind sources. The procedures outlined below are
designed to improve the accuracy of UB information on the database by giving
preference to Blind sources.

UB, flavor, style, length, soft pack/box, how long UB, and last.10 UB are all maintained .-
together as one block of questions about the claimed Usual Brand of a smoker. After we
edit incoming records, the way we handle Usual Brand information depends on whether
the smokers are duplicates or incremental to the database.

« Duplica

- When the database source = Blind (Mass or Rescreen or Brand funded) and the
update is 12 months or less:

* If incoming record is Branded source and UB = promoted Brand, keep the
DB UB over the incoming UB and move the incoming UB to 2nd UB.
Change update date to incoming keyed date.

¢ — Ifincoming record is Branded source and UB is not promoted Brand,
update DB with Brand source information.

e If incoming record is Blind source, update DB.
- When database update is 13 months or greater:

e  Ifmore than one incoming record, select UB information from Blind
source, if available,

e If only Branded sources, build best (most complete) record from various
sources.

« — {fonly Blind sources, build best record and choose Rescreen as source if
present; otherwise, randomly choose source.

e [neremental

- If more than one incoming record, select UB information from Blind source, if
available.

- If only Branded sources, build best record.
