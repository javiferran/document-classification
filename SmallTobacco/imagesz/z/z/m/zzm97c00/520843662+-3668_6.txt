Allocation Guidelines
As incremental Competitive smokers names are added to the database, they are
allocated to effectively and efficiently match Competitive smokers to the most appropriate
RJR Brands for potential conversion programs. The allocation guidelines are based on
past research and program results. "New" Competitive smokers are allocated in the
following sequence:

e If claimed UB = RJR Brand, smoker is allocated to that Brand.

e If claimed UB or 2nd UB = Savings, smoker is allocated to Savings program.

If claimed 2nd UB = RJR Full Price Brand, smoker is allocated to that Brand.

° Ifname source = RJR Brand program, smoker is allocated to that Brand.

« If none of the above, smokers are allocated to Brands as follows: «

Select: _ Non-menthol, VMT UB's

Camel: Non-menthol, VMT UB's

Salem: Full-Price Menthol UB's (except 120 length and "Concemed”)
