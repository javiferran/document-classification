Dear Dr. Feinstein: |

Tt has been suggested that you might evaluate for us a grant
proposal we now have under consideration, for which we require a
eritical review. :

Because of the pressure of time, I have taken the liberty of
enclosing a confidential copy of the application, and hope that you
would evaluate it for us. You have entire latitude on how you set

“down your comments. The Council provides a modest honorarium for
such evaluations. :

As we are now preparing for a semi-annual meeting of our
Selentific Advisory Board, we trust that we may hear from you within
‘the next few weeks 2t the latest.

If you are not able to provide the requested evaluation, please
simply return the application in- the enclosed postpaid envelope.

Sincer ely yours,

David Stone, Ph.D.
Associate Research Director
