TEST L-13,257 - WINSTON MENTHOL 100's
WITH NWA FILTER.

 

 

OBJECTIVE:

Determine parameters necessary to place this brand into production
with non-wrapped acetate (NWA) filters.

SUMMARY :

Various porosity tipping papers were used with the NWA filters on WINSTON
Menthol 100 cigarettes in order to arrive at an air dilution system which equals
the standard. TPM, smoke panel, and physical properties analysis indicate that
a 70 second (470. Coresta P): electrostatic perforation achieves the desired
results. Heat seal tipping (HST) is the preferred method of sealing the filter,
although limited tests with an emulsion adhesive were also successful.

Another test, L-13,408 has been produced (and packed) in order to increase
our confidence that 70 seconds ts the proper tipping porosity and to perform
a U. S. Mail Panel test to compare the NWA to our present cigarette.

DISCUSSION:

Regular 68 mm. green line cork tipping was gravure coated with a diamond
pattern (See Attachment 1) in the perforating area. Bobbins were then elec-
trostatically perforated to approximately 50, 70, and 90, seconds (650, 470,
and 350 Coresta P.). A chart of porostiy measurements and their percent
standard deviations for both Gurley and Coresta P. is presented in attachments.

Test cigarettes were produced on May 24 in Factory #1-3, Mark 9/PA-8
machine #1. Machine start-up and the test run was without problem. No
bad-wrap was encountered with the HST/NWA combination. One leg of the test
involved using NWA filters and Sampson #EX-267/9 emulsion adhesive with the
skip-gap-gummer. The machine started and made enough sood cigarettes for
test purposes, but the run was too short for a judgment of its mechanical
performance.
