Hi Mike!

I thought ] would have seen you by now to give you a T-shirt and souvenir bag from the
Mideast Regional. ] am carrying around in my car! Thank you so much for sponsoring
the t-shirts. The Regional meeting was a success. The Twin City Chapter made quite an
impression, Everyone felt this was one of the best conferences they had attended. I have
attached a formal thank you for your files.

I will be in touch soon.

Take Care

Cheryl
