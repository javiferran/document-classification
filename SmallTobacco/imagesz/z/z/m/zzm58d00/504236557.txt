Dear Andre,

I have now managed to sit down and organize the

two projects which we are to offer for PILC work

with the Smoke/Technology Groups. I thought you

‘would like to have details to be able to present

a more detailed programme at the meeting in Florence. ESET Shas tity

l. Nitrogen sources and nitrous oxide in smoke

We will have tobacco from three sources of nitrogen,
ammonium nitrate, sodium nitrate and urea. This is
a properly replicated trial so we can give them up

to ten replications. s

2. Effect of sucker control compounds on leaf quality

We can supply up to four replications of cured leaf
treated with n-decanol, octonol decanol mixtures,
Prime Plus (CGA41065) Bud Nip (chlorpropham),
Accotab (pendimethalin), Tamex (butralin), FST-7
(n-decanol plus potassium salt of maleic hydrazide)
and several others.

 

From ooth these trials we will have yield and quality
figures and this could be supplemented by any figures
from Smoke group. Our tobacco will be available at the
end of April 1984.

I hope this will be useful in presenting your case in
Florence.

Yours sincerely,

ives ,

L.T.V. Cousins,
SENIOR AGRONOMIST.
