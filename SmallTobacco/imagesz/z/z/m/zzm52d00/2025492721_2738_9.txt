As a study of this effect, Fig. 2 shows a plot of CORR-m vs CORR-r for each

of our SEV. We see there that every SEV with a large |CORA-r] has a targe CORR-m
of opposite sign, and vice-versa. This could be a very remarkable coincidence, but it
is much more credible that it is the result of the effect we are studying. This implies
that the reduction in our discrepancy in going from simple to multiple regression Is
largely artificial, and the true vaiues of 8 are close to -7.3 for males and -8.3 for
females.

It is well known that radon levels correlate strongly with geography", which
Suggests that it be considered as a CF. We treat it by our stratification method.

The U.S. Bureau of Census divides the nation into 4 regions, each consisting
of 2 or 3 divisions. Stratifying by regions and averaging B-values over the four strata
gives B=-6.1 for males and -8.0 for females, reasonably close to our values without
stratification, -7.3 and -8.3. However, stratifying on the 9 divisions gives an average

B of -4.4 for males and -6.6 for females, a substantial reduction In our discrepancy.

This suggests that finer stratification on geography may help explain our discrepancy. -

The finest stratification readily available is by Individual states. There are 34
states in which we have data on st least 20 counties. The average B-value from
separate anatysis of each of these is -6.1 for males and -7.2 for females. These
reduce our discrepancy by 8% and 7% respectively. We conclude that confounding
by geography does little to reduce our discrepancy.
