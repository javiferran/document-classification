less than 0.23. For the S-values we are using, CORR-r is -0.28 for males and -0.19
for females. It therefore seems incredible that the true r-S correlation can be of the
magnitude necessary to explain our discrepancy, even if coupled with a large error in
the width of our distribution of S-values. We conclude that uncertainties in S-values
are not @ major cause of our discrepancy.
Confounding by SEV and factors that correlate with them

If a particular socioeconomic variable (SEV) is an important confounding factor
(CF), stratifying our data on it into subsets and analyzing each subset separately
would greatly reduce the problem as all counties in a given subset would have
approximately the same value of that SEV. The average of the B-values obtained from

the various subsets would then give a value of B free from the effects of confounding.

The data were stratified into five. quintiles of 1601/5 =320 counties on the

basis of each of our 54 SEV in turn. This gave 540 subsets (including both sexes),
and for all 540 of them, B was found to be negative. Thus, the negative slopes in Fig.
â€˜1b, d are found if we consider only the most urban counties, or if we consider only
the most rural; if we consider only the richest, or only the poorest; if we consider only
those with the best medical care, or only those with the poorest medical care; ete for
our 54 SEV. They are also found if we consider any of the strata in between.
Following up on our method of averaging B-vaiues over the five quintiles to
obtain B-values free of confounding gives, for our 54 SEV, results ranging between

-5.6 and -7.7 for males, and between -5.4 and -9.1 for females, reasonably close to
