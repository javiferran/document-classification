Predicted from SEV. When S values derived from this process are used to calculate
m, from Eq. (4), and these are then used to fit the data to Eq. (5), B values are
changed from -7.3 to -6.0 for males, and from -8.3 to -6.3 for females. Since this
represents only a modest reduction in our discrepancy, and since it is questionable to
use S-values derived from m-values to predict m-values, these S-values were not used
in our other studies. But this exercise indicates that the obvious probiems in our
derivation of S-values are not the cause of our discrepancy.

As an entirely different approach to evaluating effects of uncertain S-values, we
then set out to determine how strong a negative r-S correlation would be needed to
explain our discrepancy. We re-assigned S-values for our 1601 counties in perfect
reverse order of their r-values, and used these S-values in our analysis. This “perfect”
negative r-S correlation reduced our 8-values essentially to zero (+0.7 for males, -0.3
for females), only cutting our discrepancy in half. The problem is that our distribution
of S-vaiues is rather narrow - for males, mean - §1.7, SD - 6.9, min/max - 28/70. If
we arbitrarily double the width of this distribution by doubling the difference from the
mean for each county to give mean - 51.7, SD - 13,8, min/max - 0/88, we are able
to eliminate our discrepancy by reassigning S-values in a manner that gives the
coefficient of correlation (CORR) between S and r to be -0.90.

We then consider the question of how strong an r-S correlation is credible.
Since any such correlation must arise from confounding by socioeconomic variables,
we studied correlations of our 54 SEV (Table 1) with r. The largest |CORR-r| for any

of our SEV is 0.37, the second largest is 0.30, and for 49 of our 54 SEV, CORR-r is
