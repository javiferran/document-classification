Rather different types of potential confounding factors are barometric pressure
{determined by altitude} and weather. Data on these are available only by states.

It we treat data on states analogously to how we have been treating it for
counties, we have only 46 data points instead of 1601, but an analogous analysis can
be done. This gives B=-13.042.3 for males and B=-14.4+2.7 for females, as
opposed to B= +8.3 predicted by the theory, a very statistically robust discrepancy.

As potential CF we consider altitude (meters above sea level), average winter
temperature, average summer temperature, millimeters of annual precipitation,
days/year with measurable precipitation, average wind speed, and percent of time
with sunshine. We stratify the data on the basis: of each of these in turn into three
subsets of 15-16 states and analyze each subset to determine B. This gives a total
of 42 analyses for both sexes, and all 42 B-values are found to be negative.
Averaging over the three strata gives 8-values ranging for our seven variables from
-9.0 to -15.5 for males and from -11.8 to -15.6 for females. In no case are the
deviations from values without stratification for a given variable in the same direction

for males and females, and in no case is the average deviation for the two sexes more

than 0.6 SD. Large negative 8-values are found if we consider only low altitude -

States or if we consider only high altitude states; if we consider only warm states, or
only cool states; if we consider only wet states, or only dry states; ete. They are also
found if we consider only states with average values of these properties. These
properties cannot, therefore, be the cause of our discrepancy.
