We recently completed a compilation of radon measurements from available
sources which gives the average radon level, r, in homes for 1730 counties, well over
haif of alt U.S. counties and comprising about 90% of the total U.S. population. Plots
of age-adjusted lung cancer mortality rates, m, vs these r are shown in Fig. 1a, c
where, rather than showing individual points for each county we have grouped them

into Intervals of r (shown on the base-line along with the number of counties in each

group) and we plot the mean value of m for each group, its standard deviation, and _

the first and third quartiles of the distribution. We-see, in Fig. 1a, c, a clear tendency
for m to decrease with increasing r, in sharp contrast to the increase expected from
the fact that radon can cause lung cancer, shown by the line labelled "theory".
One obvious problem is migration: people do not spend their whole life and
receive ail of their radon exposure in their county of residence at time of death.

However, it is easy to correct the theoretical predication for this, and the “theory”
