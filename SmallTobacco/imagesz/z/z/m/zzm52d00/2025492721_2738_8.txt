our values for the entire data set, -7.3 and -8.3. We conclude that confounding by
any one of our SEV can do little to explain our discrepancy.

This also excludes factors that correlate strongly with SEV as potential CF. For
example, air pollution correlates strongly with several of our SEV (e.g. population) and
therefore cannot be an important CF.

This still leaves open the possibility that some combination of SEV can explain
our discrepancy. The best way to investigate this is through multiple regression
analysis, fitting our data to

mim, = A + Br + OX, + OyXq + 0. + CagXuq (7)
where X,...X5, are our 54 socioeconomic variables and A, B, C,...Cg, are Constants
used to fit the data. With 1601 data points, there is no difficulty in deriving
Statistically robust estimates of these 56 constants. The results are B=-3.1 +0.6 for
males, and B=-3.5+0.9 for females, reducing our discrepancy by 29% and 31%

respectively.

However, the statistics community generally takes a dim view of using muitiple .

regression on many variables to quantify the causal relationship of one particular
variable. In our case, the strong negative correlation between m and r would cause
any variable strongly correlated with m to have a correlation of opposite sign with r.
In fitting Eq. (7), its term will therefore drain away some of the strength of the Br

term, reducing the value of B.
