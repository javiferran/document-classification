lines in Fig. 1 have been corrected. As part of this correction, data for Florida,
California, and Arizona, where many people move after retirement, have been deleted,
reducing the number of counties to 1601. (This deletion does not affect results.)

A more serious problem is that Fig. 1 is what epidemiologists call an "ecological

study”. Epidemiologists normatly study the relationship between mortality risks to _

individuals, m!, vs their personal exposure, r, whereas an ecological study like ours
deals with the relationship between the average risk to groups of individuals
(populations of counties) and their average exposure. it is well known to
epidemiologists that, in general, the average dose does not determine the average risk,
and to assume otherwise Is called “the ecological fallacy". However, it is easy to

show? that, in testing a linear-no threshald theory, “the ecological fallacy” does not

apply; in that theory, the average dose does determine the average risk. This is

widely recognized from the fact that "person-rem" determines the number of deaths.
Dividing person-rem by population gives average dose, and dividing number of deaths

by copulation gives mortality rate.

Because of the "ecological fallacy", epidemiology textbooks often state that an -

ecological study cannot determine a causal relationship between risk and exposure.
That may be true, but it is Irrelevant here because the purpose of our study fs not to
determine a causal relationship; it is rather to test the linear-no threshold dependence

of monr.
