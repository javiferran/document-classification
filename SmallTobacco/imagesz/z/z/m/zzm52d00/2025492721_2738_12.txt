miners. The principal differences among competing theories are in their treatment of
smoking, but since r-S correlations are not very strong, these differences have little
effect on the results.
Unrecognized confounding factors

ttis logically possible that there is some unrecognized confounding factor (UCF)
which is causing our discrepancy. Of course a UCF could invalidate any
epidemiological study, and few if any epidemiological studies have included as
thorough. investigation as ours of confounding factors.

Let us consider the properties of a UCF necessary to explain our discrepancy:

(a) it must have a very strong correlation with lung cancer, at least comparable

to that of smoking, but still be unrecognized as such

{b) it must have a very strong correlation of opposite sign with radon levels

{c) it must not be strongly correlated with any of our socioeconomic variables,

or with pressure, temperature, or other weather variables

(d) it must be operative in the great majority of geographical areas.

Requirement (1) means that in addition to causing lung cancer and being
unrecognized as such, it must have increased in importance by orders of magnitude
since the early part of this century, it must have affected males much more than
females until mid-century with females closing the gap in recent years, it must be an
order of magnitude more important in smokers than in non-smokers, etc. Requirement
(2) is atso difficult since correlations between radon and other factors have been

Studied extensively and are nearly all rather weak; also factors affecting radon levels
