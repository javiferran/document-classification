Apart from “the ecological fallacy", other potential problems with ecological
studies have been pointed out by Morgenstern, Greenland, and Robins*** but these
have been shown not to be applicable to our work2:*7,

The most obvious potential! explanation for Fig. 1 is that there is a strong
negative correlation between the percentage of adult population that smokes, S, and
radon exposure, r; i.e. that counties with low r tend strongly to have high S, and vice-
versa. This effect is most easily handled by use of the BEIR-IV theory® which can be
shown to give

m =a (1 + br) (1)
where m’ is the lung cancer mortality risk to an individual, r’ is that individual's radon
exposure, and @ and b are constants with a given separately for smokers and non-
smokers (a,, 8,) and for males and females. If we sum over all individuals in a county
and divide by the population, Eq. (1) reduces to

m = [Sa, + (1-S)a,] (1+4br). (2)

Applying our correction for migration and inserting numerical values for a, and a, then

leads to”
mim, = 1 + Br (3)
where
m, = 9 + 0.99S for males
m, = 3.7 + 0.325 for femates (4)

B= +7.3
