In our extensive studies of correlations with radon levels of house
characteristics, locations, and socioeconomic factors", we encountered two situations
which would lead to r-S correlations:

(1} urban houses average 25% lower radon levels than rural houses, and urban
people smoke 20% more frequently judging from urban-rural differences in tung
cancer rates

(2) houses of smokers have 10% lower average radon levels than houses of non-
smokers.

A detailed calculation of the effects of these r-S correlations found that (1)
changes the slope of an m vs r regression by 18%, but the effect is almost completely
compensated by our correction for smoking, changing the slope, B, of an m/m, vs r
regression by less than 1%. The smoking correction does not compensate (2}, but
it changes the slope B by only 5%. Items (1) and (2) were found to add linearly in
their effect on B.

These recognized r-S correlations, therefore, change B by only 6% and thus
reduce. our discrepancy by only about 3%. It seems most unlikely that there are
unrecognized r-S correlations that are over an order of magnitude larger than these as
would be necessary to explain our discrepancy.

Dependence on BEIR-IV theory

All calculations to this point, inctuding our correction for smoking, have been

carried out using the BEIR-IV theory*. However, we have shown that our discrepancy

would be about equally large for any other m-r-S relationship based on data from the
