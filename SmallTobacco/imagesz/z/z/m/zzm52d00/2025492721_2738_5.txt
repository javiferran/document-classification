Our S values were derived from a 1985 survey’? of smoking prevalence in
states, S’, corrected for variations with time in national smoking prevalence" under
the assumption that the ratio of S! for various states did not vary with time. it was
then assumed that S values for the counties within a state are due only to urban-rural
differences. That is, we take S = S‘(1+kPU)/(14+kPU}, where PU is the percent of
the population that lives in urban areas for the county, PU! is the same quantity for
the state as a whole, and k is a constant determined from regressions of m on PU (k
was found to be similar for all geographic regions).

‘An alternative method for determining S' values for states was by use of
Cigarette sales tax collections’? which are available for every year. This has the
advantage of giving data for the relevant time periods and also reflects the number of
cigarettes smoked rather than just the nurnber of smokers, although it also has some
recognized disadvantages. When these values of S! were used, our discrepancy was
increased. They were not used further.

As an approach to getting direct data on S$ for counties in the relevant time

period with due consideration for intensity of smoking (e.g. inhalation, cigarettes per .

day), we developed.a smoking variable S derived from lung cancer mortality data. We
utilized socioeconomic variables (SEV) listed in Table 1 plus S! to predict mvalues in
@ manner independent of radon levels, r. We stratified on r into six separate groups
of counties, and for each group independently, studied multipte regressions of m on
SEV. We were able to derive a linear combination of S! plus five SEV with

coefficients independent of r, which predict m-values about as well as they can be
