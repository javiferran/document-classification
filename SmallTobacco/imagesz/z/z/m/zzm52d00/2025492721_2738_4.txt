The effects of outlying points in our analyses of data on mim, vs r was
investigated by using five of the most popular statistical tests to discard either 10 or
20 outlyers. In all cases, for both males and females, this increased our discrepancy.
Outlyers were not discarded.

Ten different random samples each of 200, 400, and 800 or our 1601 counties

_ were analyzed independently. tn all cases, results for B were quite similar to those

for our entire data set, B=-7.3 for males and -8.3 for females. For example, for our
ten random sets of 200 counties, all B values were between -5.0 and -8.5 for males,
and between -4.8 and -12.7 for females. Our study might therefore be considered
equivalent to eight independent studies, each giving roughly the same discrepancy
with theory.

One might wonder how unexpected it is to find such a strong and statistically
robust correlation between m and Â¢ as we find for lung cancer in Fig. 1. To

investigate this, we studied the regression of m ont for the 33 principal cancer types.

The number of standard deviations by which the slope B differs from zero was 2.7

times larger for lung cancer than for any other type, and with just two exceptions it
was at least 4 times larger. Double regressions on r and $ gave similar results; as
expected, the m-S correlation is very large and positive for lung cancer, and the m-r
correlation is large (two-thirds as large as m-S). The only unexpected result was that
the m-r correlation is negative rather than Positive. We conclude that the strong
observed correlation between m and r for lung cancer is quite unique and remarkable.
