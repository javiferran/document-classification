Conclusions

We have explored every explanation for our discrepancy that we can think of
or that has been suggested to us. By far the most credible explanation, in our view,
is that the linear-no threshold theory fails very badly in the low dose, low dose rate
region where it has never been previously tested, grossly over-estimating the cancer

tisk.
