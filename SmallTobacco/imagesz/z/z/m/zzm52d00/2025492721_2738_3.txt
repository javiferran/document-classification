with B in units of percent per pCi/L of average radon level, and m, in units of
deaths/year-100,000. In Eq. (3), mim, may be thought of as the lung cancer
mortality rate corrected for smoking prevalence.

Problems in determining S will be discussed below. Using our best values to
calculate m, from Eq. (4) for each county leads to results shown in Fig. 1b, d. We
see that correcting for smoking does little to improve the unexpected behavior. Fitting
the data to

mim =A+Br © {5)
to determine A and B gives 8 =-7.30.6 for males and B =-8.3+0.8 for females, as
compared with the Eq. (4) theory prediction B= +7.3, a discrepancy of about 20

Standard deviations. We refer to this as “our discrepancy", and the remainder of this

paper deals with our attempts to explain it, each section treating a different approach.

Uncertainties in radon data

Our radon data derives from three independent sources, our own
measurements, EPA measurements, and studies by agencies in various individual
States. Various checks for consistency among these three sources give satisfactory
results’. Data from each of these three sources alone gives results for B very similar
to those from our combined data set. We conclude that uncertainties in our r-values
are not responsible for any significant part of our discrepancy. In fact the simplest
correction for these uncertainties would increase our discrepancy by about 8%.
