competitive products were evaluated. The competitive products were True
and Salem Lights. The candidates were Candidate A, which is "AMELIA"
(XLF-680C), and Candidate B, which is "BELAIR" (current BELAIR blend).

|. These cigarettes are currently being tested in MRD 1984 ~— 123NP, 1L24NP,

129NP, and 130NP.

As usual, smokers made replicated monadic ratings using a 6-point scale.
The Dupont study I.D. was 7GA1.

TEST RESU:.TS

The findings are given on the attached plots. Both unscreened and
screened results are given with little difference occurring between the
two sets of results.

Salem Lights smokers, Virginia Slims Lights smokers, and smokers of
“other™ brands rated Salem Lights the most acceptable of the cigarettes
tested. ‘The candidates were rated as not statistically different from
each other by these same groups of smokers. They rated True as
statistically the least acceptable.

B&H Lights smokers rated the two candidates closer to Salem Lights than
did the other groups of smokers. They found True statistically least
acceptable. Although it was a small cell, the cork-tipped product

smokers rated the two cork-tipped candidates equally acceptable to Salem
lights.
