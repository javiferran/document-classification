Each product would carry the full name of the M-2 product
stamped on the item and could in addition, be monogrammed
with the script initials of the buyer.

More important than the number of items of the premium
sold, is the immediate communication to smokers of the
image we wish to project for the brand.

Discussions:

There are many techniques that lend themselves to P.O.S.
use, and all should be explored. However, the key to this
assignment is to use P.O0.S. not only to generate awareness
and trial but to position the brand image in -the smokers

mind, impactfully and immediately.

Summary : .

The specific use of the cigarette case/lighter appears

to be a very appropriate premium device for consideration

by the Brand.

Next Steps/Timing:

Please review, and if the idea merits additional consideration

after you and Tom Owen have talked, let us know. We'll be
happy to start design, costing and availability.

cordially, hep
