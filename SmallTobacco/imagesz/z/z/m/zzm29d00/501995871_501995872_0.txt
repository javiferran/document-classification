Re: ' M-2 P.O.Ss.

Dear Dan,

Reflecting on our discussion of M-2 P.O.S., here's an idea
for consideration.

First, perhaps a non-traditional use of P.0.S. might be
advisable for M-2 given its unigue consumer franchise goal.
For example, we could consider using a P.0.S. display to
carry a unique consumer premium offer and coupon; a 20 or

30 pack display might feature both the product and a premium
that assists in quickly positioning the brand.

Secondly, the device could hchieve a higher trial rate as well
as building rapid awareness. . .

Recommendation:

The agency believes that the use of a self-liquidating premium
that positions M-2 as:

e Female
e Fashionable/Stylish
e Modern

could ad& immediate impact to M-2 image perception at the very
start of its launch. Thus properly positioned in the younger
female adult smokers’ mind, we should achieve greater awareness

and trial than might be otherwise expected.

Consider the use of a premium like a brushed chrome metal
cigarette case And/or a slim stick chrome lighter on P.0.S.
materials. Either or both could conceivably be self-liquidated

via coupon plus proof of purchase and cash.
