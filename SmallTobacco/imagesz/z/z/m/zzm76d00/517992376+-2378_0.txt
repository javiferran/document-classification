Our key business drivers at retail are the “3 P’s:

1) Product Availability (variety and depth)

2) Presence (location, visibility and advertising)
3) Promotions (type, quantity, quality, frequency)

Product availability is one of our “3 P’s” and is a primary accountability to which very little action
can currently be executed on the basis of meaningful account or market specific data available.

Issue - Current Considerations

Currently SR's/RR’s report in-stock or OOS on Region designated brand styles resulting in:
- Limited measures which provide little or no actionable information
- Inconsistent brand style tracking prevents chain, area, national rollup/views
- Current report is measured as % of doors - thereby assuming all accounts are equal
- Current report does not identify conditions/problems nor does it provide degree or extent
of conditions

Objective

The objective of the revised product availability reporting procedures is to provide better
measures and more actionable information on product availability at retail.

Action Steps for revised product availabllity reporting procedures.

1) Begin to track/monitor OOS at retail on dur top 20 national brand styles and region
identified market opportunity brand styles effective August 26, 1996. (We will place the
top 20 brand styles in SIS here in Winston-Salem...see attached list.)

- SR’s/RR’s will continue to report OOS at retail but with brand style focused on identified
national and market place business needs. No change in reporting other than the

number and selection of brand styles.

2) Each region must provide a list of brand styles (suggest no more than 5 to 10 - if any at
all) that you would like to measure that are not included in the national top 20 brand styles.

Note to RSM's/RBM's: Piease submit these brand styles by Region to your respective
AMO and they will ensure placement in SIS for August 26, 1996 effective date -
