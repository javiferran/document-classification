and lung cancer. Possible artefactual explanations that have been advanced for this observation are:

. Greater degree of smoker misclassification when exposure is greatest;
. Greater role of confounding when exposure is greatest;

. Interviewer bias;

. Differential recall bias;

. Publication bias.

Oho

The above list is, of course, potential explanations of which | am aware. There may be others.

The first two points have been proposed by Peter Lee. Although he has some minimal data, there has never been
a study designed to explore these two points. The third point was a proposal that | put forth some time ago, and
we have an ongoing study that should be completed in several months which will shed some light on this
possibility. Differential recall bias has been proposed by a number of individuals, and Don Barry has put some
considerable work into it. He is currently carrying out a study which will further our knowledge regarding this
possibility. Lastly, publication bias is obvious, since studies which found no initial effect rarely made any attempt to
determine dose-response relationships. (This is not always the case, as in Brownson 2).

\n addition there are two other approaches that might also help clarify the situation. The first is to look at dose-
response relationships for ETS and CVD. The second is to examine the slope of the dose-response curve based
on some type of pooling of the data and compare that slope with the slope that would be predicted from active
smoking.

| would propose that we all think about this situation and then meet by conference call to discuss the situation and
make some concrete proposals for further research. Since | will be gone for three weeks starting on Monday, |
would like Helmut to coordinate this first effort. Although | will be gone, | would be available for a conference call.
| would hope that we can move fairly quickly on this, since it is of considerable importance.

Thanking you ail in advance.
