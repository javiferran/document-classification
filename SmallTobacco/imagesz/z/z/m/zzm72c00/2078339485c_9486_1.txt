The following additional iterns are clear for use in the above program from an intellectual property perspective:
Rubbermaid Toolbox, if sourced from Rubbermaid

Picture Frame (4" X 6")

Syrup & butter Holder Set

The items (toolbox, syrup & Butter set, throw blanket, dart board and fishing combo; cordless drill) are in the pick-up box
in front of Patty Angelo's desk. Please note however that the fishing combo and cordless drill have not as yet cleared.

To recap, we are awaiting the following information:

corduroy shirt: new sample

car coat: confirmation of the color of the car coat & a sample swatch of the actual ining

fish bait combo: How long has the reel been on the market and approx. how many have been sold?

Also, Joe and | wouid like to see the entire collection as a whole and with the actual colors and logos. Please advise
when this can be viewed.

Thanks.,..Chris
