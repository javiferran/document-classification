Versus Competitor Products Test CONFISENTIAL

There are currently six blind product tests being conducted
of Marlboro versus L & M, Winston, and Viceroy.

The tests range from 25% complete to 75% complete at this
writing, and it appears that the Marlboro brand is, at the
least, equally preferred to its leading competitors.
