Discussion

Even with the results reported here and the learning that is
underway in 1979, I believe sampling will be the Promotion
Department's top priority learning project beyond this year.

The reasons for this point-of-view are: a) my assessment of
sampling's potential to make a major contribution toward our
business objectives, and b) my belief that sampling is a complex
issue requiring extensive learning, with the need to build on
prior learning as we proceed, if we are to most productively
exploit this trial device.

This learning is considered proprietary information. It should
not be circulated outside the Company.

For a full understanding of the learning generated from this
study, you should read John Hribar's research report.
