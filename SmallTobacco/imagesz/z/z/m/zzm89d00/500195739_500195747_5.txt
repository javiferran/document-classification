CRITERIA THAT HAS GUIDED SAMPLING DEVELOPMENT
nn ee, VEVELOPMENT

Development of new sampling approaches has been guided by
eight key criteria. These criteria are listed in the assumed
order of their importance. It is not necessary for each sam~
Pling approach to meet every criteria.

â€˜1.

2.

 

Be administratively feasible, ensuring satisfactory pro-
duct security an program integrity.

Get the right brand to the right prospect. This has led
to targeting our activities and to programs that can sam-

ple multiple brands and styles. We will usually sample
a menthol and non-menthol brand. It also leads to the use
of screening steps to select the brand to be sampled based

on the smokers preferences.

Reinforce the brands product benefits and the desired
imagery. This has resulted in the use of advertising
materials in conjunction with sampling. It has also led

to integrating the sampling program into the existing
sampling environment. For example, the disco programs.

Use a sample quantity large enough so that the smoker can
become familiar with the brand and evaluate its smoking
characteristics. Also, the sample quantity may need to be
Sufficient to initiate a shift or accomplish a change in
the smoker's smoking preferences in favor of the sampled
Products performance. Using this criteria we have moved
to sampling quantities greater than four cigarettes, go-
ing as high as four cartons in test.

Be able to sample enough smokers to measurably impact

the business.

Defend major brand Styles against spin-off style sampling.
This is done by sampling brand families.

Only sample non-RJR brand smokers or concentrate spending
against them. Home delivered sampling is one way to skew

Spending against competitors.

Provide sampling capabilities that can meet a variety of
needs at various spending levels and ina timely manner.
