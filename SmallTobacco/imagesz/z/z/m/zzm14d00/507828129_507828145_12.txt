In a subsequent report, Harke published the

‘amounts of CO and nicotine to which the nonsmokers had

been exposed.” He said the buildup of CO and nicotine in
the test room was above the limits set by his government
as maximums for working places. But to underscore the
abnormal conditions of his experiment, Harke said:

It must be emphasized at this point that it does
not appear possible that such smoke densities can
be generated by smokers. This experiment using
smokers ((rather than smoking machines) )would only
be reproducible when 50 persons were placed in the
room and each of them would smoke three cigarettes
during a period of 30 minutes. The irritation . - +
would be so great that certainly 4 large majority
of the smokers would have to leave the room prior
to the end of the smoking period.

. While Harke was Looking for acute effects of
nicotine and carbon monoxide in nonsmoking humans, a group
of canadian researchers were investigating longterm conse-_
quences of increased CO levels in an experiment with primates.

. They confined a dozen monkeys in cages for two

years and exposed them seven days a week, 22 hours aaily-- -

with time out only for biological measurement and cage clean-

up--to inordinately high CO levels. These levels were two to seven

times the maximum exposure which the U. S. Environmental
protection Agency has ruled U. S. workers may undergo during

and eight-hour day, provided such exposure occurs no more

than once a year.
