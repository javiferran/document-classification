The measurements considered to be criteria for
acute physical effects of smoke are blood pressure, pulse
rate, heart muscle action as shown by EKGs and skin tem-
perature. Of these, skin temperature would be the most

. sensitive, Harke reported. After checking this factor among
the nonsmokers in his experiment, he summarized in a 1972
paper:

The quantities of smoke absorbed during passive
smoking are too small to cause a significant
change in the skin temperature of nonsmokers,

even when the nonsmokers are located in rooms
- containing extremely large smoke concentrations.
