The report failed to say that. It also failed to

state, as Harke, the scientist who performed the experiment

had done, that even wi

thout ventilation the levels of CO

and nicotine only reached the same "order of magnitude"

set by the German government as maximums for working places,

and that those maximums "are not even approximately attained

under realistic conditions" of smoking.

A greater omission from Steinfeld's report was

any reference at all to the widely recognized work of Yaglou,

involving 24 cigarettes smoked per hour in a room about nine

by ten by 16 feet. Yaglou's conclusion was that "the carbon

monoxide concentration was much too small to affect the non-

smoker, even at the lowest air flow. . - when the room was

filled with bluish smoke.
