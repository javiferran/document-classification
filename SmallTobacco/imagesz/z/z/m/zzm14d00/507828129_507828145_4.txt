mentioned by PHS until its 1973 report to Congress on
smoking and health, it was reported by one columnist as
long ago as December of 1970 that the FAA-HEW study con-
cluded "that the tobacco smoke is no health hazard to-
nonsmoking passengers." The columnist was correct.

The study states:

On the basis of the very low levels of the
contaminants measured, it is concluded that
inhalation of the by-products from tobacco
smoke generated as a result of passengers
â€˜smoking aboard commercial aircraft does not
represent a siqnificant health hazard to
nonsmoking passengers." (Italic added.)

The Surgeon General's explanation that the long
| aelay in making the results of this study public was
caused by "bureaucratic inefficiency"!+ is remarkable.

_ Further, it is strange that after learning of the findings
of the study the Surgeon General was still recommending a
ban of passenger smoking on airplanes. Why, during his
press conference on January 10, 1972, did the Surgeon
General say, "(W)e are now accumulating data showing that -
it is harmful to the individual in the room with the per~
son who smokes," without even mentioning the findings of
the FAA-HEW study???

It is worth speculating that the study would

never have been referred to by the Public Health Service
