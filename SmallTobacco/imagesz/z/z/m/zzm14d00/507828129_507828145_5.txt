had it not been for the fact that,’ a month after the
Surgeon General's news conference, during a Congressional
hearing, an HEW official was questioned about it and
pledged that it would be mentioned in the 1973 PHS report. 13

But the two paragraphs devoted to it in that report failed

 

to mention its essential conclusion--no "health hazard"--as

stated above.

“Nor dia the 1973 “aocument)4, which \ was sent to
Congress and published after Surgeon General Steinfeld
left the government, make any other reference to the
“passive smoking" question so heavily promoted by the
1971-1972 declarations upon which current prohibitory
urgings are based. Thus the case must rest primarily
on the handling of the "evidence" in the 1972 PHS

report which Steinfeld sent to congress. ' es
That document advanced four propositions. The

first was. that tobacco smoke contributes to air pollution,
‘especially elevating levels of carbon monoxide (CO),
benzo (a) pyrene (BAP), nicotine and oxides of nitrogen
(NO and NO>).
Jaffe, a researcher who had published a defini-
tive study in 1970, had found that the total contribution

of cigarette smoke to atmospheric CO was so "negligible"

that he gave no percentage estimate.

15 dhe report did not

mention Jaffe at all.
