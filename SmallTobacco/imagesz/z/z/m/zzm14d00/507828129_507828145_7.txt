and Keith--not mentioned in the report--had published in

41965 their findings that there is little or no NO) in

cigarette smoke.

So much for the first of the four bases for the
claim by PHS and Surgeon General Steinfeld in the 1972 re-

port. What of the second--that laboratory animals have

* been harmed by breathing smoke? This emerged as the most

candid--and the weakest--discussion of the contention that
smoke harms nonsmokers. Their report reviewed experiments

in which animals were forced to live in chambers containing

high concentrations of cigarette smoke for extended periods--

sometimes the entire life of an animal--and then questioned
the pertinence of such work:

Because the damage observed in’ these experiments
was seen after prolonged exposure to high con-
- centrations of cigarette smoke, and because the
comparability of animal exposure to smoke with
that of human exposure in smoke-filled rooms is
unknown, it is presently impossible to be cer-
tain from animal experimentation about the
extent of damage that may occur during long-term 7
intermittent exposure to lower concentrations.

A third proposition in the report, and a correct
one if given proper qualifications, is that tobacco smoke
“oan contribute to the discomfort of many individuals."

Obviously there are circumstances in which smoke can
