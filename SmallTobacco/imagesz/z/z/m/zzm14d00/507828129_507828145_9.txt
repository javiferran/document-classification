Members of the Congress, who are scientific laymen and
for whom the report was prepared, might well believe that
many persons would encounter this kind of situation and
therefore suffer harm. One must refer to the original
‘experimental research paper in order to learn that this
situation was completely unrealistic.7° -
In the experiment, two smokers and two nonsmokers

sat in a small European car with its windows and doors
shut inside an enclosed garage. The two smokers each
smok ed five cigarettes in 62 minutes--virtually continuous
smoking by each, to butt lengths of about one-fifth of an

The 1972 PHS report also noted what it called a
“well controlled" experiment in Germany by Harke, in which
21 persons each smoked two cigarettes in 16 to 18 minutes in
a room equivalent to about ten by 12 by 14 feet. It

identified the amounts of CO and nicotine which Harke

then measured in the air, both in the absence of any ventila-_
