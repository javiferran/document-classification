The implementation of the assay in eukaryotic cells will require the choice of
suitable repeated sequences. As noted above, there are a variety of known sequences
that undergo UCO, and these would provide a suitable target. The opsin genes on
the X chromosome are particularly attractive because a large number of variants
already exist and these could be used for reconstruction experiments in developing
the assay. This assay would then allow us to determine the effects of different
parameters on UCO. For example, we should be able to see if there are effects of
DNA damaging treatments on UCO as well as whether DNA repair mutants (such
as xeroderma pigmentosum strains) show increased UCO. It will also be possible to
determine if UCO rearrangements are found at higher frequency with ageing and if
there are tissue differences. We note that such an assay is different from some of the
procedures that are currently in use in lower eukaryotic cells such as yeast. Those
assays require cell survival and do not readily distinguish between duplication
events that are caused by changes in chromosome number (e.g. by non-disjunction)
from duplication events caused by true UCO. To my knowledge, there is no assay
available at the present time that will detect UCO that occurs in mammalian cells in
culture or in situ. The availability of this assay will thus not only serve to gain
insight into the factors controlling UCO, but may also lead to a molecular diagnostic
procedure for early detection of diseases caused by somatic UCO.

It is anticipated that this project will span 3 years and be carried out by 2
graduate students for their Ph.D. theses. The estimated direct cost for the first year is
$60,000.
