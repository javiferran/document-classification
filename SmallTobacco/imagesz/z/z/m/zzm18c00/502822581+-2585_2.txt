How does nicotine affect ganglionic development in
the embryo and fetus?

Does nicotine imprint on the fetus with subsequent
development of essential hypertension?

Does nicotine accumulation in the fetal brain,
adrenal glands, heart, and kidneys modify develop-—
ment of these organs? :

What is the effect of nicotine on the hormonal
systems of the adrenal and those organs which
regulate adrenal function?

To what extent is nicotine accumulation in the
fetal kidney involved in a possible antidiuretic
hormone abnormality or other complications in later
development?

Since nicotine modulates neurological function in
adults at several areas (central nervous system,
skeletal-muscular, ganglia, and so forth), how does
it modify development and function in the fetus and
young child?

To what extent does the effect of nicotine on neuro-
logical function contribute to neurologic disorders
in children?

Whak is the potential for nicotine metabolites being

‘carcinogenic in combination with benzo(a)pyrene?

Carbon Monoxide

To what extent are embryonic, fetal, or newborn
tissues more or less sensitive to the effects of
carbon monoxide than those of adults?

What are the chief physiological consecauences of
earbon monoxide exposure on the developing fetus
or newborn?

What are the critical concentrations of carboxy-
hemoglobin which produce effects, and what are the -= -
dose-response relations?
