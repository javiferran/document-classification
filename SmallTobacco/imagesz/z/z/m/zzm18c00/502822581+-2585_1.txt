To what extent can experimental studies of exposure
to the components of cigarette smoke clucidate the
mechanism of reduced birth weight?

{a) Is the smoking~-associated reduction of fetal
growth due to a reduction in the rate of mitosis
resulting in a decreased number of cells?

(b) Is the smoking-associated reduction of fetal
growth rate due to a decreased number of cells
in some parts of the body but not in others?

Is the smoking-associated reduction of fetal growth
rate accompanied by deficiencies in learning ability,
emotional development, or physical growth?

To what extent does maternal smoking in humans affect
maternal and fetal blood catecholamine concentrations?
To what extent do these components of cigarette smuxe
affect uterine and placental blood flow?

How do they affect fetal heart rate, breathing pattern,
electroencephalographic activity, or other variables
that can be monitored (what are the dose-response
relations)?

To what extent does smoking low-yield cigarettes differ
in its effects on the mother and fetus as compared with
regular cigarettes?

To what extent are there interactions between the
effects of the major (and perhaps minor) components of
tobacco smoke?

How can efforts to actively discourage smoking during
pregnancy be made more effective?

To what extent will smoking withdrawal during preg-
nancy result in changes in infant weight, perinatal
mortality, and long-term sequelae?
