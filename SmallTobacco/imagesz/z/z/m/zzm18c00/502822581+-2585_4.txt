37. To what extent does benzo(a)pyrene cross the
placenta and enter the fetus?

38. What is its distribution in the fetal organs and
tissues? ,

39, To what extent do the benzo(a)pyrene concentrations
encountered in smoking mothers affect the growth
and development of the fetal brain and other: organs?

40. To what extent does benzo(a)pyrene have long term
effects on the developing embryo and fetus; that is,
are fetuses so exposed subject to the later develop-
ment of neoplasms or malignancies?

As noted above, these are a few questions which bear
exploration. I look forward to the workshop.

Thank you.
