Overall Average 17,5* 16.5*

*Excluding August 3

The highest daily averages were found to be July 13 for carbon monox-
ide and July 10 for TPM (dry). It is to be noted that July 13 was the
next working day after July 10. The CO average for July 13 was 19.4 with
the overall average of 17.5 and for TPM (dry) the July 10 value was 17.4
compared with the overall average for monitor cigarettes of 16.5.

These fluctuations are confirmed by similar variations in the brand

tests for carbon monoxide.
