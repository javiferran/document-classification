Since the last report (March 1981) the FTC has published a revised list of
carbon monoxide measurements for the brands in the Federal Register blaming
the difference on a computer programming error. The carbon monoxide levels
for the brands are now on the average 3.2% lower than those of the Tobacco
Industry laboratory. This shift is discussed in detail later in this re-
port.

There continues to be evidence of variations resulting in wide swings
in the daily levels of the reported data in spite of large scale deletions
of all determinations for entire days. The phenomena are similar to those
reported in my prior letters.

A. CARBON MONOXIDE MEASUREMENTS

In my previous report dated August 3, 1981 relative to Test No. 23,
it was noted that the average carbon monoxide measurement by the Federal
Trade Commission for brands tested was 11.7% higher than that of the
Tobacco Industry laboratory. On August 14, 1981 there appeared in the
Federal Register a notice by the Federal Trade Commission revising the pre-
viously published brand carbon mcnoxide measurements.

The reason given for the change was a computer programming error,

It was stated that â€œthe correct recalculated figures are included in the
table which follows. Each of these figures is precisely & percent Jess
than the figures previously reported."

The overall carbon monoxide average for the current test (Test No. 24}
exhibits a further decline in the Federal Trade measurements to the point
where that average is now lower than the average of the same brands re-

suiting from the Tobacco Industry laboratory tests.
