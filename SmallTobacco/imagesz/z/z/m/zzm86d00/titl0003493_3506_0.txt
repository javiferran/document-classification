Dear Mr. Austern:

As requested, I have examined the date records consisting of labora-
tory determination calculation sheets and statistical summary sheets which
you represented to me to be copies of the original laboratory data sheets
compiled by the Federal Trade Commission and used as the basis for figures
on "tar" TPM (Dry) and nicotine yields of various brands of cigarettes as
well as the final reports on these data released by the Federal Trade Com-
mission.

It was the laboratory data sheets for the “tar" and nicotine figures

released by the Federal Trade Commission under the date December 1981 which

I examined and upon which I report in this letter.
