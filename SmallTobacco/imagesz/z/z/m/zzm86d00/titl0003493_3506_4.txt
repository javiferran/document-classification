Once again, the disparity between the FTC and TITL results is great-

est, both in the absolute and relative sense, at low carbon monoxide lev-

els.

I have previously reported on the correlation between the TPM measure-
ments and the CO values. Evidence of this relationship continues, as wel]
as the peculiarity that unlike brands with Tow TPM (dry), the high TPM
brands (over 21 mgms) showed CO averages less than the TPM averages.
