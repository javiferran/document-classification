Mr. H. T. Austern

It will be recalled that the apparent rounding method was to round up
the TPM average if it was Â© or more in the tenths of a mgm position and down
if less. In similar fashion the nicotine average would be rounded up if
there was a 5 or more in the hundreths position. Carbon monoxide averages

would be handled in the same manner as that for TPM.

Sincerely,

Herbert Arkin
