A statistically significant shift in brand test averages accompanying a
shift in the level of carbon monoxide can be seen below:

Carbon Monoxide Determinations

Monitor and Brand Cigarettes

For Two Periods
FTC Laboratory Data

Brand Cigarettes

Monitor Cigarettes Number Number
Average Carbon Above Below
Period Monoxide (mgms Average* Average*
June 24, 1981 - August 31 17.8 127 69
September 1 - October 28 16.6

*Above or below average for other period. This difference is
statistically significant. There was one brand with identi-
cal averages for both periods. It was not included in the
above table.

This general association of level shifts between TPM and carbon monox-
ide values might indicate some common experimental factor, perhaps of an
enviromental nature, Further examination and analysis may possibly dis-
close this factor and the possible general reduction in the variability of
the testing method.
