At this time, the practice at the FTC laboratory seems to be to report
all TPM or CO figuras of less than 1 mgm as **. However, in the summaries
these figures are often rounded off to zero. This can cause difficulties
and can result in negative values at times. It is suggested that they be
carried as their true value using an additional decimal if required.

With the increasing number of low TPM cigarettes, the measurement of
TPM and CO in the very low range has been and will be an increasing problem.
It is suggested that it might be wise ta consider methods of dealing with
this problem. The low value figures praduced for some cigarettes by FIC
are of very questionable meaning.

C. _DISCARDS

In my prior analysis it was nated that a considerable amount of data on
the laboratory sheets were discarded by merely stamping the column for the
determination “deleted”. It was observed that the result of such a practice
is te falsely give an impression of greater uniformity of test results than
actually exists in practice.

in the last test (#23), a tremendous increase in the number of discards,
reaching a new record, was observed. The records for this report (#24, De-
cember 1981) indicate a very considerable decline in this practice although
still well above the average for the past. There were 869 discarded deter-
minations, 201 for monitor cigarettes and 668 for brand cigarette determina-

tions.
