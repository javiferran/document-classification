In addition, there was an error in footing on the summary sheet for
Galaxy F. SP., 85mm. This error changed the average carbon monoxide for
that cigarette to 14.4 mgms rather than 13.4. The FTC reported average
is incorrect for that cigarette.

There were a total of 11 errors in posting from the laboratory sheets
to the summary sheets, 10 fcr the monitor cigarettes and one for a brand.
In addition, there were 6 errors in posting from the computer sheets to the
laboratory sheets, one resulting in a change in the CO value for Marlboro
Lights, F. SP, 85mm from 12.4 to 12.1 mgms. The figure included jin the FTC
report for December is incorrect. These posting errors are detailed in Ap-
pendix II.

A more serious problem has become evident for low tar cigarettes with
the use of the new smoking machine. There were 107 cases in which the TPM
(wet) and/or TPM (dry) were calculated to be negative figures as compared
with 7 in the last test (#23). (See Appendix I11) This of course is impos-
sible, but nevertheless these values were posted to the summary sheets as
negative values. Thus, in computing the averages for a brand the values
were totalled considering the negative figures incorrectly as values to be
subtracted, The result is that these impossible values serve to reduce the
brand average improperly.

This practice results in figures of dubious meaning and value. In my
opinion, whenever an impossible figure arises, such as negative TPF values,

they should simply be discarded and not used in any computation.
