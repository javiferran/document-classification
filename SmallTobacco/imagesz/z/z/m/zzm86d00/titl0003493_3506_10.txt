This test provides an opportunity to examine the variations over time in
carbon monoxide determinations for samples of monitor cigarettes.

The variation in carbon monoxide measurements for this group of rela-
tively homogeneous cigarettes from day to day was even wider than that for
TPM (dry). The range of CO measurements for the monitor cigarettes was
from a high of 19.4 mgms to a low of 16.1 mgms. For the same cigarettes
the TPM (dry) range was from 17.4 mgms to a low of 15.6 mgms.

White there was not a close association in the variations from day
to day, there were similarities indicating a general association between
variations in TPM (dry) and carbon monoxide values. For both sets of meas-
urements, the average daily values were higher for the period June 24 to
July 22, 1981 than for the later period.

A similar situation did not exist for the nicotine measurements for the
monitor cigarettes,
Further, it is to be noted that the lowest daily average for both car-

bon monoxide and TPM (dry) measurements were acheived on August 3, 1981.
