Carbon Monoxide Measurements

by Federaâ€™? Trade Commission and

Tobacco Industry Laboratory
For the Same Brands

As of March and December 1981
(Tests #23 and #24)

Average CO (mgms)

FIC TT
Original ~ March 81 13.8 12.3
Revised - March *8] 12.7 12.3
December 198) 1.1 11.5

*In accordance with the information supplied by the Federal Trade Com-
mission in the Federal Register dated August 14, 1981, the original
average was reduced by 8%.

Further evidence of such a decline may be seen from the fact that
about two thirds of the brands which the Federal Trade Conmission tested
and reported on in both periods had carbon monoxide averages which were
Jower jn the December test than in the March tests, after allowing for
the 8% revision and eliminating brands reported by the FTC as reformu-
lated in the March report,

It may be noted that even after eliminating the brands reported as
reformulated, and the 8% revision in the March data there were 26 brands
for which the CO measurement differed by one or more mgms between the two

tests with some disparities exceeding 4 mgms.
