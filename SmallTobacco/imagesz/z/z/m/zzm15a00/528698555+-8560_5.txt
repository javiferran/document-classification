Cigarette Design Research Division Monthly Status
Date: October 30, 1998
Project Name and Number: EPPCAT (600)
Objectives: Develop EPPCAT filters to support TI-Marketing initiatives.

Status: Completed PD8121 prototypes for Tl evaluation. PD8121F appears to be the
best candidate to me. If TI would allow the use of a 31 mm filler and tipping to match ]
believe that it would meet all of their target parameters. The prototype currently uscs a 27
mm filter and yields a TIOJ of 6.4 with an FTC puff profile that is exactly what was
requested, execpt for the last puff ticking high. A 4 mm inercasc in butt length would
eliminate that last puff to achieve a yield of about 5 mg TIOJ. If this is not acceptable
EPPCAT cannot be made to achieve the parameters desired by Tl and should be stopped.

Next Steps and Timing: Evaluate improved prototype(s) with TI 11/98.
