Cigarette Design Research Division Monthly Status

Date: October 30, 1998
Project Name and Number: V-Foam Filter (131)

Objectives: Devclop dual filtcr using polymer foam technology as potential cost
reduction for VANTAGE SCS styles.

Status: Mct with Ossic Babson, Christophe Theunissen and Kenneth Robinson
(NOMACO) here at BGTC on 10/26/98 to determine if we could find a common ground
for cost versus improvements. Chuck Ashcraft (RJRT Packaging) and Teresa Lance
attended the mecting. We believe thal we found the common ground and NOMACO
agreed to make an improved sample and provide new costing by mid-November. The
July sample TP-301-157-6 provided good cost savings potential, but the TP-301-157-30
sample in August climinated any potential savings due to extreme weight and slow

machine speed at NOMACO.

Marshall Eakes at American Extruded Plastic (AEP) in Greensboro, NC made an offer to
make the V-Foam filter rods using an open-book costing. He passed on the opportunity
to make the V-Foam filter rod about a year and a half ago, because he did not have the
means to control tolerances. He has since purchased new equipment for doing so and
decided to extend this offer. AEP would provide an open-shop service at the lowest cost
if RIRT would purchase all of the raw materials. This would eliminate capital risk for
RJRT and eliminate large raw material inventory risk for AEP. Chuck Ashcraft, Teresa
Lance and I visited AEP on 10/15/98 and determined with Chuckâ€™s advice that AEP
could make and contro! the V-Foam rod, but that it would take from 6 to 9 months to
develop the rod. I advised AEP that we currently had other vendors working on the
project and could not commit at this time on this item.

Updated Brands R&D on 10/27/98. Brands R&D requested a meeting for a brief update
and determination of assessment for decision to continue the project. If this project is
stopped Brands R&D would negotiate with Baumgartner for a replacement filter for
savings. In my discussions with Baumgartner, they tell me that they have no ideas on
how to do this after looking into what Brands would like to achieve.

Next Steps and Timing: Update and Assessment with Brands R&D 11/9/98. Obtain improved

rod sample and costing from NOMACO 11/98.
