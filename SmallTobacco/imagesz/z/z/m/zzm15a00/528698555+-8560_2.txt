Cigarette Design Research Division Monthly Status
Date: October 30, 1998
Project Name and Number: IP Cigarctte Development (241)

Qbjectives: Develop consumer acceptable prototypes with reduced ignition propensity
as measured by the NIST test and other appropriate means.

Status: The Task Force testing and then the movement of the IP Lab facility will delay IP
testing of the planned new experiments until the new IP Lab is complete. It appears that
we will not be able to conduct IP tests on new variables until 1QTR99.

Please see Sharon Sparks report for IP testing results and other news.

Next Steps and Timing: Evaluate and conduct IP testing on FL1100 cigarettes 1/99,
Evaluate Franklin Fiber cigarettes on Cotton Duck #10 and Whatmans filter paper 1/99.
