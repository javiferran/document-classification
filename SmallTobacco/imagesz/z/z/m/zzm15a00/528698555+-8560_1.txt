Cigarette Design Research Division Monthly Status

Date: October 30, 1998

Project Name and Number: Degradable Filter (131)

Objectives: Develop degradable filtcr materials and components (tipping, plug wrap,
adhesive) where spent cigarette materials will disintegrate in the natural environment

within a few days.

Status:. See Teresa Lanceâ€™s report for information on the work with materials from
Consolidated Cigar Corp.(CCC), BBA and AIM.

 

Aju Lekwauwa obtained two samples of fiber from Mr. Sigler of Qualicel. The fibers
are being tested at AIM for samples to be screcned by Teresa. A meeting has been
scheduled for 10/30/98 between Alex Armstrong, Aju, Teresa and me to determine next
steps.

Tech Products thinks that early 12/98 would be a good time to visit their facility to see the
degradable PVOH open-cell foam filter rod being run. Moncy in the budget has been
reserved for Chuck Ashcraft, Teresa Lance and me for this visil. Bob White tells me that
the formulation will include a starch that under process conditions will convert to sugars.
Until the visit he will send samples of each run regardless of tolerances so that the
material can be tested for degradability. We have determined that it would not be
practical for Tech Products to wrap the rod with paper in their facility to control O.D.
(circumference). He thinks that grooved belis would work to set the O.D. al a given
target and will pursuc that direction. He is telling me that they will most likely extrude
10-rods at once upon any scale-up, which would keep cost down.

Next Steps and Timing: Mcct with Alex Armstrong from AIM and determine
next steps 10/30/98. Visit Tech Products 12/98.
