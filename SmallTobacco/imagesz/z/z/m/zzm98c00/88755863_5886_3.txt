dose levels of 50, 160, 500, 1600 and 5000 mg/kg. The range of pre-dose body
weights was 204 to 232 grams for males, and 194 to 220 grams for females.

All animals were observed for mortality at 1, 3, 6, and 24-hours
following dosing and twice daily for the remainder of the 72-hour observation
period. Individual body weights were recorded prior to dosing. All rats
surviving on Day 4 were sacrificed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation and
discarded.

Results
Cumulative mortality for the range-finding study is presented in Table 1.

No deaths were observed at. the 50, 160, 500 or 1600 mg/kg dose levels.
Both males and both females dosed at 5000 mg/kg. dose levels died within
3 hours of dosing.

LDgq STUDY

Experimental Design

Based on the results of the range-finding study, an LDgg was performed at
dose levels of 1590, 2150, 2930, 3980, and 5410 mg/kg. All animals were fast-
ed overnight prior to dosing, and food was returned to the animals one hour
after dosing. Water was freely available at all times. The test article,
B-73, was administered as a single intraperitoneal dose to five male and five
female rats per dose level. The range of pre-dose body weights was 232 to
267 grams for males, and 176 to 238 grams for females.

All animals were observed for signs of toxicity and mortality at one,
three, and six hours after dosing, and daily for the remainder of the 14-day
observation period. Individual body weights were recorded pre-dose and at
sacrifice on Day 15. All surviving animals on Day 15 were sacrificed by
carbon dioxide asphyxiation. Gross necropsies were performed on all rats
sacrificed and the carcasses were discarded.
