TEST ANIMALS

Thirty-five male and thirty-five female Sprague-Dawley outbred albino
rats purchased from Camm Research Lab Animals (Wayne, New Jersey) were select-
ed for this study. Prior to placement on study the animals were quarantined
for at least seven days and observed twice daily for appearance, behavior, and
mortality. The animals were individually housed in suspended stainless steel
wire bottom cages, with Purina® Rodent Laboratory Chow® #5001 and water avail-
able ad libitum. At the end of the quarantine period, healthy animals were
assigned to treatment groups using a computer-generated random numbers table.
All animals assigned to study received unique identification numbers. The
animals were housed in a temperature-controlled room with the temperature
ranging from 20-27°C?, 10 to 15 air changes per hour, and 12-hour light/dark
cycle.

TEST ARTICLE PREPARATION

Appropriate amounts of B-73 were determined using the specific gravity of
0.94 g/ml (supplied by the sponsor) and mixed with methylcellulose (1%) to
achieve the correct dose levels. The concentration of B-73 in the mixture was
adjusted so that the volume administered per unit body weight was the same for
all treatment groups (10 ml/kg body weight). All mixtures were thoroughly
agitated just prior to and continually during dosing.

RANGE-FINDING STUDY

Experimental Design

A preliminary range-finding study was performed to select dose levels for
the LDgq phase of the experiment. All animals were fasted overnight prior to
dosing, and food was returned to the animals one hour after dosing. Water was
freely available at ail times. The test article, B-73, was administered as a
single intraperitoneal dose to five groups of two male and two female rats at

 

“The temperature deviation from that specified in the protocol (2243°C) is
not expected to alter the results of the study.
