presented in Table 4. An increase in body weight was noted in all animals

surviving to Day 15.

Gross Pathology - Gross pathologic observations are presented in
Table 5. Enlarged spleens were frequently noted at necropsy at the 1590, 2150

and 2930 mg/kg dose levels.

Conclusion

Based on the results of this study, the LDsg (calculated by the method of
Litchfield and Wilcoxon?) of B-73 was calculated to be 3752 mg/kg for combined
sexes, with 95% confidence limits of 3144 to 4477 mg/kg. The LOsg for male
rats was calculated to be 3732 mg/kg, with 95% confidence limits of 2844 to
4898 mg/kg. The LDsq for female rats was calculated to be 3732 mg/kg with 95%
confidence. limits of 2844 to 4898 mg/kg.
