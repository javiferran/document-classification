4 Experimental Design and Procedures

4.1 General Design

The study will be performed as a 14-day inhalation siudy on male and female B6C3F, mice. The
mice will be head-only exposed to diluted MS of the Reference Cigarette 1R4F. The head-only
exposure mode will be used to ensure maximum reproducibility of uptake of the test substance
by inhalation, i.e., to minimize test substance deposition on the fur that could be subsequently
taken up by grooming.

The MS exposure will be daily, 7 days/week, for 14 days. The daily MS exposure will last 60 min.
The inhalation period will begin with a dose adaptation period of 1/3 and 2/3 of the final daily
exposure duration on study days 1 and 2, respectively. The exposure will be carried out in a flow-
past 52-port chamber (Cannon et al., 1988).

MS will be generated in basic conformity with ISO standards, with some deviations being
necessary for technical reasons. MS will be diluted with filtered, conditioned fresh air to obtain a
target TPM concentration of approximately 320 and 640 pg/l. These concentrations were used
by Coggins et al. (1990).

Two cage-housed control groups will be included: 1 untreated control group and 1 positive
control group receiving an intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (12.5 mg/kg body weight).

The study will be conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) principles
(Good Laboratory Practice-principles of Belgium, 1988; GLP Consensus Document: The OECD

Principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), 1992; Good Laboratory Practice principles of —__

Germany, 1994). Care and use of the mice will be in accordance with the American Association |
for Laboratory Animal Science Policy (1991). / |
