5 Statistics and Evaluations

For the analytical assays, quantification limits will in general be determined from the signal-to-
noise ratio 10 : 4 (chromatographic methods) or from the sensitivity/reproducibility specified by the
suppliers for the analytical equipment (e.g., carbon monoxide analyzer) (GOP AC 203).

As descriptive statistics, the number of values, a mean value (e.g., the arithmetic mean), and a
measure of variance (e.g., the relative standard deviation) will be given for all continuous data
(e.g., body weight). For samples including at least 1 measured value below the detection limit, the
median, 25 and 75 % quartiles will be given. Values below the detection limit will be graphically

represented as zero.

The particle size distribution will be calculated using linear regression analysis after probit
transformation of the cumulative frequencies and logarithmic transformation of the aerodynamic

diameter values (Finney, 1971).

The following study objective-related statistical tests will be performed on the biological daia:

The MS-exposed mice will be compared to untreated control mice by analysis of variance
(ANOVA). In those cases where the overall comparison shows a significant difference between

these groups, the Duncan test (Duncan, 1955) will be applied for the pairwise comparison between

the groups.

The positive control-treated mice will be compared to the untreated control mice using the t-test.

All tests will be conducted at the level of significance of a= 0.05, o=0.01, and a=0.001
(2-tailed). No adjustment for multiple testing will be made. Results will be considered statistically

significant at p <0.05.

Additional explorative statistics will be applied, e.g., the statistical methods used by Coggins et al.
(1990).
