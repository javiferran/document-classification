4.4 Mainstream Smoke Generation, Dilution, and Characterization

The research cigarettes will be conditioned according to ISO 3402 (1991). They will be smoked
in basic conformity with ISO 3308 (1991) and ISO 4387 (1991). The 1R4F mainstream smoke
will be generated on a 30-port positive pressure smoking machine (INBIFO type SM85) {SOP
CRC 120). Some minor deviations from the ISO standard 3308 are necessary for technical
reasons (Table 2).

The mainstream smoke will be diluted with filtered, conditioned fresh air (dilution factors 1 : 90
and 1:45). The smoking conditions will be checked by determining the butt length, puff

volume, and puff count prior to and 1 time during the inhalation period (SOP CRC 105, 107,
and 146).

The MS will be conveyed via glass tubing of approximately 4 m, with a volume of approximately
2 |. The flow rate through the exposure chamber will be approximately 13 l/min. The mean age
of the MG in the complete exposure system (glass tubing and exposure chamber) will be <8 s._
