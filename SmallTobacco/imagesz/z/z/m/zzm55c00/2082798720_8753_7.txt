the laboratory unit. The room temperature and relative humidity will be maintained at 22 + 3 Â°C
and 55 % (30 to 70 %) (SOP CRC 4 and 53). The light/dark cycle will be 12 h/12 h.

Each mouse will be housed individually. The bedding material will be autoclaved softwood
granulate (SOP CRC 44). An autoclaved, fortified pellet diet from cage lid racks and heat-treated
tap water from water bottles with autoclaved sipper tubes will be supplied ad libitum in each cage

(SOP CRC 16). All the mice groups will be deprived of food and drinking water during the
inhalation period of the exposed mice.

The age of the mice at the start of the inhalation period will be approximately 6 weeks. The body
weight of the male mice at that time will be approximately 22 g and that of the female mice

approximately 18 g, the relative standard deviation (RSD) being <10 %. The acclimatization
period will be >3 but <14 days.

For the serological screening, blood samples will be taken from 5 mice 1 day after arrival (SOP
CRC. 30) and at necropsy. The serological screening will be performed extramurally for the

presence of antibodies to 16 mouse-related viruses, to the bacterium Mycoplasma pulmonis, and ~

cilia-associated respiratory bacillus as well as to the protozoon Encephalitozoon cuniculi (GOP IT
H69).

To check the hygienic conditions within the animal laboratory room during the inhalation period,
samples of laboratory air (SOP CRC 96) will be collected 2 times (once per week), those of the
autoclaved mice diet (SOP CRC 95) and heat-treated drinking water (SOP CRC 97) once during
the study. To check the effectiveness of the laboratory disinfection and sanitation, impression
samples will be taken prior to the introduction of the mice and 2 times thereafter (once per week)

(SOP CRC 129). From each sample, the bacterial plate count will be determined (SOP IT H19,
MB 68, CRC 95 and 129).

For the smoke exposed groups, a flow-past 52-port exposure chamber (Cannon et al., 1988)
(glass, aluminum, stainless steel, and brass; volume: approximately 0.41), equipped with
52 glass exposure tubes (Figure 1), will be used (SOP CRC 10 and 17). Mice will be individually
exposed in glass tubes matching the size of their body (Figure 1) (SOP CRC 10).
