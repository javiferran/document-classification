4.5 Biological Assays and Determinations

In order to determine and compare the biological activity of the MS, assays and determinations

will be carried out as specified in Table 4.

For the sample collection of polychromatic erythrocytes in bone marrow and circulating blood
(SOP CRG 277 and 281), the mice will be sacrificed approximately 24 h after their final exposure.
Bone marrow will be obtained from the femurs. Erythrocytes will then be purified from nucleated
cells (Percoll gradient) according to Romagna and Staniforth (1989). Blood will be obtained from
the heart. Smears will be prepared from bone marrow and circulating blood and stained using

Giemsa. Preparations will then be screened microscopically for the presence of micronuclei.

In addition, some of the blood will be used for the determination of the number of micronucleated

reticulocytes using the Stratagene Microflow Mouse Micronucleus Analysis Kit.

Bone marrow and blood from the positive control group will be evaluated in the same way. Bone

marrow and blood samples will be taken approximately 24 h after treatment.

For bone marrow, the polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE)/normochromatic erythrocytes (NCE)
ratio will be determined by counting 200 erythrocytes; for blood, the PCE/NCE ratio will be
determined by counting 1,000 erythrocytes. The number of micronucleated polychromatic
erythrocytes will be determined by screening 2,000 polychromatic erythrocytes. In order to ensure
the blind evaluation of the samples, the determination of the PCE/NCE ratio will be done
separately from the evaluation of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes. The evaluation of
the number of micronucleated reticulocytes will be performed by counting 10,000 reticulocytes

(Stratagene/Litron Laboratories).

To confirm the exposure to MS, blood carboxyhemoglobin concentration will be determined.
