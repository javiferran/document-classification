conditioned in modular lab unit C122 for >8 to <20 days prior to smoking, at a temperature of 22

+1 °C and 60 + 2 % relative humidity, without selection according to weight or resistance to draw
{SOP CRC 87 and 203).

4.3. Animals and Animal Treatment

Hybrid B6C3F, mice, bred under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions, will be obtained from
Charles River, Portage, M!, U.S.A.

The mice will be individually identified with subcutaneous transponders (SOP CRC 165). Forty
male and 40 female B6C3F, mice will be randomly allocated to 1 untreated cage-housed group,
1 positive control group, and 2 smoke-exposed groups (SOP CRC 125) (Table 1).

Table 1 Groups and Concentrations

The mice will be kept in an animal laboratory unit with restricted access (CRC modular
laboratories Ci11, C112, and C113) under hygienic conditions (SOP CRC 4, 6, and 20}. The
