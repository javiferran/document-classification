The present 14-day inhalation study on mice will be performed to assess the genotoxic activity of

the mainstream smoke (MS) of the Reference Cigarette 1R4F as determined in the micronucleus

assay in bone marrow and circulating blood erythrocytes and reticulocytes of B6C3F, mice.

A similar study was performed by Coggins et al. (1990) who reported inconclusive results in
terms of induction of micronuclei following exposure to MS of the Reference Cigarette 1R4F. In
the present study, similar experimental conditions will be used but with double the number of
mice per group and an additional target (blood in addition to bone marrow) that will be evaluated

by 2 independent and different methods.

The Reference Cigarette 1R4F will be smoked in basic conformity with ISO standards. Selected

chemical and physical parameters will be determined in diluted MS.

Male and female B6C3F, mice will be head-only exposed to MS from the 1R4F in a flow-past

52-port chamber. The exposure will be daily, 7 days/week, for 14 days. Except for the smoke
adaptation period, each exposure will last 60 min. The target MS concentration will be
approximately 320 and 640 ug total particulate matter/. These smoke doses - in accordance with

published data - were chosen to enable the formation of micronuclei in bone marrow and

circulating blood erythrocytes and reticulocytes.

The biological activity of the MS will be investigated using the following parameters: bady weight,

in-liie observations, mortality, and micronucleus formation.
