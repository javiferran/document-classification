SUBJECT: Low/No Nicotine Projects

I, LN-50
NOW LN 100 Prototypes

Test products have been released for an upcoming Product/Concept test of NOW
100 prototypes for the NOW low nicotine project. The objective of this
development pathway has been to reduce the smoke nicotine yield versus the
current nicotine yield by a minimum of 50%. The objective has been met with
both prototypes which were produced for this consumer testing. Prototype #1
utilizes a blend composed solely of low nicotine off-shore tobacco. This product
achieves a smoke nicotine reduction of just over 50%. Prototype #2 uses the same
base blend except that the Part II burley and flue-cured was denicotinized on the
FS-2001 pilot line with a double pass to simulate a single pass through #605. This
product achieves a 63% reduction in smoke nicotine. Mailout of the test products
occurred the week of 4/17; results are due 6/5. A Fourth Quarter 1989 test
market introduction is planned.

VANTAGE LN 85 Prototypes

The objective of the VANTAGE LN program is to design products which deliver
50% less nicotine than conventional FFLT cigarettes. Two of the developed
prototypes are variations of the VANTAGE 100 blend, while the third prototype is
a modified WINSTON Lights/CAMEL Lights blend. All prototypes feature low
nicotine tobaccos and white tipping in an 85 mm configuration. Test results are
