pending product fielding, originally scheduled for 4/17. This fielding is currently
on hold due to a change in the test methodology that Marketing would like to

ursue. Sufficient quantities are available to meet the original test requirement
nvolving carton usage or the alternate testing program which calls for a two-pack
monadic test followed by a Concept Product test. It is anticipated that the time
needed to change testing methodology will delay the mailout date by three to four
weeks,

LN_Tobacco Production

Farmer Participation

Twenty-four North Carolina farmers have been contracted to produce a total of 278
acres of LN flue-cured tobacco which should result in the production of 500,000
pounds of cured leaf. Twenty-one Kentucky farmers have been contracted to grow
a total of 178 acres of LN burley tobacco which should result in the production of
300,000 pounds of cured leaf. contract with Avoca for the production of 45,000
pounds of LN flue-cured leaf from 22 acres has been finalized.

Seedling Production

The production of 2,000,000 LN flue-cured tobacco seedlings and 800,000 LN burley
seedlings, being grown by three commercial growers from seed provided by RJRT,
is on target. Back-up flue-cured seedlings are being grown at Avoca. Most of the
burley farmers under contract are producing their own plants from seed provided
by RJRT. The first flue-cured seedlings should be ready for transplanting by 5/4.
The earliest transplanting of the burley seedlings is targeted for the middle of
May. Avoca: Approximately 10,000 square yards of tobacco beds have been
fumigated for the production of LN transplants. These beds were sowed 3/28 and
4/3. Rainfall for March was 40% above normal and has delayed this work. In
order to meet future domestic requirements, ample seed of the LN tobaccos will be
produced during the 1989 growing season at Avoca.
