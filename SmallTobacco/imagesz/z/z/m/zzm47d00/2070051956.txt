Problem debated

Hoechst Celanese Corp., which
Philip Morris USA blamed last
weekend for the problem that led it
to recall 8 billion cigarettes, issued
a statement Tuesday denying the *

claim.
The Somerville, N.J., company
. said it had found no evidence link-
ing it to tainted batches of a chemi-
cal “plasticizer” used in making
cigarette filters.

Philip Morris USA spokesman
David Laufer said the New York-
based tobacco company “stands by
our statement about the source of
contamination.”
