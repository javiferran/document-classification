Project Name: | Comparison of Three Air Distribution Systems by Computational Fluid Dynamic

Modeling

 

 

Objective: | To prepare and submit a publication manuscript that compares the removal
effectiveness of three different air distribution systems in a model hospitality venuc

by CFD modeling by July 2000.
