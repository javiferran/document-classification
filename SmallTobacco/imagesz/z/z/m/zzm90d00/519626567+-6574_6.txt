Direct Account Program Elements

B&W /ATC Combined

 

Common Across Both

° “Value-Added” and display shipper elements are current program key drivers
« Neither fights PM’s “authority” to set FP category requirments, but pushes its savings volume via share of category incentives
e Neither wanted to push volume as a payout criteria, ATC did with “Double Value” update to at least have on paper a program with payments

closer to PM’s

Major Differences

e B&W places a good deal of value of securing store level data (ATC does not even requrest it)

resulting in payment based on all B&W volume
