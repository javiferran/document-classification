B&W’s Perspective Likely Is That Their Trade Battle Is With RJR/ Lorillard, Not PM

@ B&W’s wholesale programs avoid direct confrontation with the driving elements of PM’s program:
- Very basic, non-share/volume performance criteria for 80+% of potential max payout
- Final element of full payout is linked to GPC’s position within the savings category

@ B&W’s merchandising efforts are clearly geared toward maintenance of some degree of presence/visibility
- Carton outlet “row” presence maintenance (very few pack display payments in carton outlets)

- Target of “best possible” pack outlet position (goal is 2nd best positioning), very flexible
- Pay basis is B&W volume with no payment caps (at least no caps from a realistic perspective)

 

@ ATC merger enhances payment size

- More volume at wholesale level
- Automatic “grid” volume adjustments for retail merchandising

 

@ Wholesale/Retail/B&W Sales Force alliance efforts primarily in the savings arena, and based on category share measures

- GPC savings position payout linkage (Sales push - Merch. grid help - Wholesale payout max.)
- ATC AVA program elements continuation will enhance tie-in
- Aforementioned volume boost to enhance payout levels/grids
