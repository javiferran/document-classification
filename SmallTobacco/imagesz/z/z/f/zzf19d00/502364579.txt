Dear Miss Hott:

You have an interesting theory outlined in September 15 letter
concerning the pleasant pastime of smoking. But the fact is that although
we are liberally supporting with funds active research work on the question
of tobacco usage, we are not ourselves engaged in medical research. Two
of the organisations to which contributions have been made and continue to
be made are the American Medical Association Education and Research
Foundation, 535 North Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60610 and the
Council for Tobacco Research-U.8.A., 150 Rast 42nd Street, New York,

New York 10017.

Perhaps you may vant to present your ideas directly to one or
both of these orgenisations. Meantime, thank you for the thought you are
giving to the question of emoking, concerning which there is so such being
written and said nowadays.

Sincerely yours,

TAP-als Tt. A. Porter
