Subject: | Casey's General Stores

After many months of negotiations, we finally have a contract signed with Casey's. As
you know, back in April, Caseys’ decided to go with P.M. and BAT; however, shortly
after that decision was implemented, they realized that to maintain their volume, they
needed us on contract as well.

The current backbar setup for cigarettes (see pictures attached) is 8’ long and 8.4’ high.
P.M. has 4' or 50% of the setup and is on a base contract at approximately $60. Per
month. BAT has the top portion of the other 4’ section or 25%, and has maximized their
payment at $400 +. We have the lower half for the remaining 25%, and are on a full
PRP at our current grid rate of $140 per month. Our eight baskets, which is our prime
merchandising space, and encompasses the 3-P’s along with the Doral sign outside the
box starts at 30” from the floor and goes to 56” from the floor. Based on the average of
8’ from the counter fo the backbar, our space is all very visible.

The reason we decided to take the horizontal position we took was based on the fact
that over the last 4 years, Caseys’ volume has remained steady at about 135 cpw, and
thus has shown no upside potential. Based on this, we felt our merchandising space
was a good buy, and would more than adequately defend our business. Especially
when you consider what BAT is paying, and that we would have had to increase our
payment by at least $160 per month or $2,304,000 per year to share the top of the 4’
section with them. This just didn’t make good business sense.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Ro
