Menthol_and Triarstin Loss Frou Aretie Lights Filter, Rods
SUMMARY:

Louisville Branch Testing Department has conducted four separate
tests to determine the rates of menthol and triacetin toss from
Aretic Lights filter rods under various storage conditions.
Analyses have bean conducted by both R&D and Branch Technical
Services. The results of these tescs indicate no significant ©
loss of menthol or triacetin regardless of storage conditions.

A recommendation is presented that Arctic. Lights filter. rods he
handled and stored using normal procedures with. uc special pro-
tective maasures being taken to control menthol loss.

INTRODUCTION

During the early development work for Arctic Lights it was rec- ™
ognized that some special precautions might be required to prevent

loss of menthol from filter rods. Dr. Heitkamp obtatned samples

from two trays of filter rods cver/a 5 day period and reported

a substantial loss. of menthol (Dr. N. D. Heitkamp to D. V. Cantrell,
April 17, 1978). Dr. Heitkamp's report indicated only a very

slight loss of triacetin. . .

Two possible methods were devised for preventing. menthol loss
from Arctic Lights filter rods, The first was a specially con~
structed filter rod tray which was totally enclosed on the top
and all four sides. The bottom fit flush with the shelf of a
tray trolley to form a nearly air tight container, The second
method was a sealed tray trolley with plywood sides, top and
bottom, Doors were Fitted ta the trolley with metal frames
and felt gaskets.

 

A series of tests was designed to evaluate the various methods
of holding Arctic Lights filter roda.
