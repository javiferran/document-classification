PURPOSE

The purpose of ‘this study was co determine the rate of menthol
sand triacetin loss from Arctic Lights filter rods in the following

storage. containers.
1. Regular Filter Rod Tray.
2. Modified, enclosed Filter Rod Tray.
3, Sealed tray trolley. -

CONCLUSIONS

1. There were no significant losses of menthel or triacetin
after 72 hours of exposure regardless of storage conditions.

2.: Both. the enclosed tray and sealed trolley would be
awkward to use in the factory and would present additional
inventory control problems.

RECOMMENDATIONS

It is recommended that no special protective méasures be taken

to prevent loss of menthol from Arctic Lights filter rods. It

ie also: recommended that a procedure be established to monitor

the triacetin and menthol content of Arctic Lights filter rods

in the filter fabrication department (immediately after production)
and in the cigarette fabrication department (immediately before
use). I£ monitoring data show a long term indication of menthol
loss, consideration will be given to modifying application targets
or establishing nrocedures to prevent loss.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The first test series was conducted during the week of June 12,
1978. One tray of Arctic Lights rods was placed in the sealed
trolley. One regular tray and one enclosed tray were stored out-
-side the trolley. All three trays were sampled ‘mmediately after
inanufacture and at 3 hours, 6 heurs, 12 hours, 24 hours, and

72 hours after manufacture: The results of this test,  sumnarized
in Table I, show no significant loss of menthol or triacetin after

° 72 hours regardless of the method of storage.

Since the data of test #1 conflicted with Dr. Heitkamp's findings
a second test was conducted during the week of June 26. For
this test only the sealed trolley and unprotected. tray were eval-
uated. Due to an analytical malfunction, the samples before
exposure (Q hrs.) were lost. However, the data summarized in
