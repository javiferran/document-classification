Schools to Aid
Drive Against.
Pupil Smoking

Ohio County intends to coop-
erate fully in a program an-
nounced jointly by the West Vir.
ginia Departments. of Health
and Education to combat smok-
ing among school pupils.

Superintendent Harry Wil.
fong of the Ohio County Public
Schools said the county. was
“going to cooperate” in the pro-
gram outlined by State Health

- Director N. H. Dyer.
Dyer’s report, endorsed and-

recommended by State Superin-
tendent of Schools Rex. M.
Smith, contained eight provi-
sions which each county health
department was urged to imple.
ment immediately,

’ They were: .

1. Make available to school
personnel! the. latest health in:
formation and assist. them in.
securing the best teaching aids.

2. Utilize the tested education
Principles of participation.

3. Enlist the aid of voluntary
health agencies.

4. Help schools in the prepa.

. Tation of resources units, short-

term projects and in-service ed-
ucation for teachers.. .
5. Lend a hand in interpreting
the school health program to
the. community.
6. Involve parents in the pro.
gram.

 

 

7. Don't rely on scare cam-
paigns. .-

8. If necessary, accept an al- |

ternative.

Dr. Dyer, in his report, cites *
three alternatives in the cam-
Paign against smoking: Educa- -

tion against’ acquiring the. hab-

it; education and‘ support in giv- -

ing up smoking if. the habit is
already acquired, and education.
toward less dangerpus forms of
tobacco usage and against inha-

lation of smoke in the tougher -

Cases. . ‘

Wilfong said he hoped the pro- me
gram would be included in all
the county schools. “The soon. ~~
er it’s started, the. more effec. ..

tive. it. will: be,” he said. :

He explained that he thought
the younger pupils are more
susceptible to a concerted edu-
cational program against smok-
ing and expressed the opinion
that. the “First: Grade
too soon” to start.
