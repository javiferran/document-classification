M-2 Fold-in: A Strategic Page 6.
Perspective

STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS (Cont 'd)
© To what degree must M-2 be perceived as a total female
product to be successful?
- Do women want only a “free standing" M-2 brand image?

=- Would users abandon the M-2 brand if it were folded
into family because it was perceived to no longer be
a woman's brand?

o Given that Salem Family's image target is to position the
Brand as smoked by as many males as females

~ Can M-2 be folded in without making Salem Family appear
even more female than it is now?

 

o Is M-2 truely a unique different product than Salem Family?
- Does it appeal to a different target?
- Is it incompatable with Family Brand image?
- Is it more than a “low tar spin-off"?
- Is the product more contemporary than family?

o Can RJR maximize/optimize M-2 SOM by not folding the brand
into family?
- Would it have greater appeal to “women? |
- Can it add significant plus non RJR business not folded?

- Can it better fill the 100MM LT growth area without
fold-in?

FOLD-IN AND TIMING
Should RJR wish to fold M-2 into Salem Family two key questions
should also be addressed. .
© At what point int time should the fold-in take place?
© To what degree should the "Fold-in" happen?
- Should the "“fold-in" be partial or total? | ,

TIMING

Much care should be taken to be sure the M-2 brand is not folded-in
too rapidly. It must be given the chance to establish its own *,
identity and user base.
