Perspective

(While the terms “defensive” and offensive" as applied to
marketing can be interpreted many ways, for purposes of
this review - a “defensive brand plan" is one which as-
sumes that the majority of users of the product will come
directly from other brand styles within the family group.
An “offensive brand plan" assumes the majority of users
will come from outside the brand family.)

Both Winston Ultra and Salem Ultra are therefore “defensive”
in nature - planned to draw most of their smokers from with-
in the Parent Brand Family.

THE M-2 OPPORTUNITY:

M-2 also to be a "spin-off" from the successful Salem Brand
Family. But, unlike either of the Ultra spin-offs - M-2 is
different from the Parent in more ways than it is similar.

How does M-2 differ from the Salem Parent:
@ M-2 designed to appeal exclusively to women -

Family appeal is universal/neutral.

@ M-2 is to be perceived as a "slim" style/fashion
brand - Family appeal is more mainstream.

M-2 is designed to appeal to younger adult women

woe is designed to appeal to women who are (or
peropive - -themselves to be) markedly different
psyc graphically than current Salem woman

smoker.

Advertising for M-2 clearly recognizes these differences.
@ Prime emphasis is on user imagery, not product
imagery.
e Salem product heritage is used, but it is clearly
subordinated to user imagery.

@ Copy - language and tone - are clearly addressed
to women.

Why was M-2 created?

As both Winston Ultra & Salem Ultra were, M-2 was originally
' Created as a defensive brand opportunity. . ty
