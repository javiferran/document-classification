In order to understand why the concept of “fold-in" to family
advertising is right for these brands, it is important to
understand the key reasons for the creation & positioning of

Winston & Salem Ultras.

Winston Ultra/Salem Ultra
Creative & Positioning Goal Synopis

Both Ultra Styles were created and positioned to:
1. Keep current Brand users in the Family as they move
to Ultra low tar styles. .
2. To reflect to the highest degree possible the Parent
brands product perception -

e Winston "Taste"
e Salem "Light Menthol Refreshment”
3. To use and extend the Parent Brands‘ image to the

target via -
e Winston “Men of America" User Image

@ Salem “High Country” Brand Image

4. To draw trial and conversion from smokers in the
expanding Ultra segment who are not currently
smoking Parent (Winston or Salem) products.

The essence of both Winston and Salem Ultra styles is funda-
mentally a - defensive marketing posture -

Both styles were developed to keep smokers from switching out of
the Parent franchise to other brands when they wanted to switch
‘to a cigarette with Ultra Low Tar. In fact, the very existence
. of the Parent name rather than a new "free standing brand” re-
t~ytrp flects a basic defensive strategy calculated to stop losses from
‘  " the Parent primarily and only secondarily to attract smokers of
' ‘non Parent brands to the new ultra style.
e Salem Ultra National Sales Performance Final Report
(11/10/80) shows 55% to 60% of Salem Ultras’ business
is cannibalized directly from Salem Lights.

Of the gross .7 SOM Salem Ultra is achieving only 3
share points are additional to the Salem Lights.

Winston Ultra is too new nationally to have established
hard reliable cannibalization data.
