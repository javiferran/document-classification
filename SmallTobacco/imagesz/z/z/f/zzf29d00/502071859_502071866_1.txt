Perspective

BACKG ND (Cont'd)

"Folding-in" of spin-off brand advertising accomplishes several
key marketing objectives:

1. A single, clear, precise focused Brand image is
created and maintained.

2. The Brand personality and Brand image are not
diffused.

3. <All advertising expenditures are consolidated
and efficiently maximized.

The result of the "Family Advertising” policy becomes a "single
voice" advertising approach which becomes synergistic - The con-
sumer receives a clearer advertising message (brand image)
Gelivered with far greater media power in terms of gross impres-
sions from media's increased reach and frequency. The net effect
is a singular more powerfully delivered message.

The family approach to advertising works most effectively when
spin-off styles are fundamentally compatable with the brand in -
e Brand Imagery
@e Heritage
e Demographic/psycégraphic appeal

In short, the ‘more closely the spin-off resembles the parent brand |

the easier and wiser it is to fold-in to family advertising.

DISCUSSION

Within the past year, Esty has launched two "Ultra" Brands
for RJR -

Winston Ultra, Salem Ultra

Both are being folded into family advertising. The fold-in of
these styles after their successful kk launch is consistent with
RJR marketing strategy. Both are or will be perceived as -

e Extensions of the Parent in Ultra Form.

@ Very close in imagery and product
perceptions to the Parent Brand.
