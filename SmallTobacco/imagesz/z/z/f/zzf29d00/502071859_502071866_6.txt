M-2 Fold-in: A Strategic Page 7.
Perspective

TIMING (Cont'd)

@ The introductory period as currently planned may
be too short to achieve the above.

TO WHAT DEGREE “FOLD-IN®*?

 

the concept of "Fold-in" has been thought of as all inclusive.
The style would be incorporated fully into brand family ads -
including family ads where every style is shown in a “line ad."

a \)

Perhaps, M-2 .if folded-in - could be partially folded-in. M-2
would not appear in: |

@ Full line ads.
e Ads which are "male" in tone.
@ Ads which are male & female.

Thus, from an efficiency standpoint M-2 could be folded-in and
still preserve the majority of its uniqueness.

RECOMMENDATION/SUMMARY

M-2 represents a potentially strong opportunity for RJR. As yet
all hypothesis are untempered by in-market experience.

There are three (3) key questions which should effect fold-in.
They are: — .
@ Will M-2 unique imagery/targeting survive fold-in?
~ Will M-2 smokers continue to buy if product is
“not unique/female." .
@ Will M-2 adversely hurt Salem Family Image/Sales by
ae. _being folded-in?
“ ——<— - what is a Salem smoker?

~ @ Can M-2 hit optimum sales levels as a folded-in brand
spin-off - or could it do better in drawing substantial
new (non RJR) business as a separately marketed brand.

 

Unfortunately, other than as conjecture, the answers to these
questions are not available from M-2 users. I would recommend
that the Agency, Brand and MDD prepare a thorough research
