M-2 Fold-in: A Strategic Page 5.
Perspective

THE M-2 OPPORTUNITY:

Given that:
@ 29% of Benson & Hedges Menthol Lights smokers and
@ 26% of Virginia Slims Menthol Lights smokers

«-. came directly from the Salem Brand Family - it appeared that
M-2 would represent a good wedge to re-capture those smokers and
move them back into the Salem Family fold.

Does M-2 have a broader opportunity?

Virginia Slims is the fastest growing brand in the
country, while Benson & Hedges is the 7th fastest.
The 100MM LT category is forecast to grow over 50%
between 1980-85. .

CATEGORY SOM FORECAST

 

100MM LT 80 85 SOM
16.0 24.9 +8.9

With Phillip Morris having two strong female solo 100MM
entries (B&H & Virginia Slims) they are well positioned to
capitalize on the growth trend, while RJR is underdeveloped
in this area. -- Loe

@ Judgement would suggest that the success Virginia
Slims has achieved is due, in most part, to -

The Brand being perceived as a totally
FEMALE product.

It is possible to speculate that a separate total female identity
for M-2 could produce significantly larger volume for the M-2
brand than would be possible if the brand is folded into family,
with the resultant image diffusion it would suffer.

STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

Prior to a fold-in of M-2 these key strategic considerations should
be addressed and researched.
