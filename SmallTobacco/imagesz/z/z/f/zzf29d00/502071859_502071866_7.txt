proposal that would address all the key issues above. And that
consumer research proposal be fielded in-market prior to making
a recommendation on M-2 fold-in.

most detailed *paycographic* understanding of our M-2 smokers
be undertaken. The results of in-market performance plus deep
consumer research should be a good guide in future planning.
