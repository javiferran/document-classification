Views expressed at the press conference at Folkets Hus,

June 18, 1979, Fourth World Conference on Smoking and Health

 

General: approx. 30 journalists, of which about 15 participated

in their capacity as delegates from foreign organisations.

The press conference was a resumé of the morning presentations

and questions related to these presentations. A great number

of the questions dealt with:

the resources of information of the tobacco industry vs
official institutions

the tobacco growing countries' economical profit from tobacco
health questions and their social consequences

legislation or not

ecological factors

the responsibility of politicians

the situation in Scandinavia

The conference was held in a room that was too small. There were

no micorphones or loudspeakers, and both questions and answers

were hard to distinguish in the rather noisy audience.

Examples of points of views that were put forth -- naturally

‘mainly against smoking and growing of tobacco:

The social insight about the damaging effects of smoking

accelerates quickly, primarily in the industrialized countries.

Increasing consideration is given to the non-smokers, who

increase in number and consequently dare claim more consideration.

Smoking is a kind of suicide and therefore the scientific

research has to consider its work relative to suicide.

 

Legislation against smoking was not recommended. However,
local regulations should be made possible to prohibit smoking

in public places.

The economical advantage of the industry when it comes to
information on smoking and its consequences is enormous. |
In this respect, politicians should take greater responsibility.

A certain improvement in this respect can now he noted.

Too small a part of the tax revenues from tobacco is used in
campaigns against smoking.
