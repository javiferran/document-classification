- The decrease in productivity and the increased hospital costs

caused by smoking are so far relatively unknown worldwide.

~ The LDC's obtain a fairly small part of the income from the

tobacco growth, a much lesser part than is usually mentioned

by the tobacco companies.

- The individual tobacco grower finds himself in a difficult

situation. To him it is simpler to grow tobacco than other

crops. The tobacco grower therefore has to be compensated in

. some way in he switches to other crops. For the country on

the whole it is more advantageous to grow other products.

There are aslo ecological aspects to the problem:

.7~ in many regions, tobacco is dried with imported petrol

- in other places, wood is used, which means that forests
are devastated, causing increased erosion and expansion of
the deserts. Exact figures on this problem are not yet -

available. This particular topic of the extremely complex

question regarding tobacco has, however, not yet been widely

discussed.

‘

In Sweden, Sw.Kr. 2 ~ 3 million have been spent on information

_ about the damages caused by tobacco.
In Sweden, young girls smoke more than young boys.

Smoking kills 10 - 15 times more people than does alcohol.
But abuse of alcohol causes more important social problems,

e.g. broken marriages, etc.

Also passive smoking -~ where people's lungs are damaged because

of others smoking in their vicinity -~- is now beginning to be

considered, not the least in hospitals.

In Sweden 1 out of 15 dies from tobacco smoking. The comparative

figure for tuberculosis is 1 out of 450.

In Great Britain, 1 out of 7 men under 64 dies from smoking.
The corresponding figure for women is 1 out of 20. This means
that 22 000 women become widows every year.

This creates terrible tragedies, which the politicians‘have to
do something about quickly.

Damages caused by cigar smoking are far less important.
