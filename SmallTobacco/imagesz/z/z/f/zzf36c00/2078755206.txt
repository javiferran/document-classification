From: Karen Daragan

Subject: Cabarrus Smokers Rights Group

I thought this list could get you started in developing a smokers' rights group in the Cabarrus/Mecklenburg
area, These ten individuals are who we consider "ninjas" (internally) -- people who write and phone their
legislators frequently and want to get involved in the movement. They all belong to the PM Smokers'

Caucus.

The woman circled, Faye Vernon, has indicated on the most recent Smokers Caucus survey that she would be
interested in starting a smokers' rights group.

I think she's your best bet or your first phonecall.

I hope this helps. Let me know how it goes.

Happy Holidays!
