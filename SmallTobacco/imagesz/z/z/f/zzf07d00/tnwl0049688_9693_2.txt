Those states in which the program will be implemented are ~y sat
essentially divided into two categories -- those with a critical © bey .

During the remainder of 1990, the Committee will consult closely
with the client to refine the state priority list. Clearly, the
Committee will not be able to devote the same amount of time and
resources in each of 23 states. Before the end of the year, the
Committee will have access to the 1991 schedule of conventions
and conferences of the AFL-CIO and its affiliated organizations.
This will facilitate our effort to lay out the Committee's
priority states for the first and second quarters of 1991.
