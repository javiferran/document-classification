Peaceful Coexistence Directory

To recognize those establishments that accommodate smokers and nonsmokers, RJR has
published a directory listing participating establishments by state.

What is the Response to the Peaceful Coexistence Program?

The response to the materials and to the ventilation changes has shown that the program

is effective. More than 5,000 establishments in 50 states are using the materials,

including all the Host Marriott airport locations. Due to this overwhelming response to

the program, we are currently testing a plan to sell the materials rather than providing

them free of charge. However, RJR will make these materials available at a price

competitive with plain white napkins but at a much higher quality.

Comments from restaurant and bar owners nationwide have been extremely positive.
"Everybody is joking and getting along better," says a Denver restaurateur.
"really makes a difference..." exclaims Washington, D.C. bartender.

",,.one of the best ideas ever," concludes a restaurant owner in Baltimore.

"The materials are going over great, people are talking instead of grumbling," says
a waiter in Silver Spring, MD.

Peaceful Solutions

RJR also has produced several brochures for hospitality owners and managers and their
patrons. These brochures provide helpful hints and information on how to achieve
peaceful coexistence in a variety of settings, including the workplace. They also include
tips on how to provide improved indoor air quality as well as how to accommodate
smoking preferences in restaurant and bars.

The brochures can be ordered, free of charge, by calling 1-800-528-1228.

What Do You Need To Do?

All you need to do is take advantage of the Peaceful Coexistence Program to help you
create an environment where all of your patrons feel comfortable in your establishment.
