Materials

To bring the coexistence message to hospitality patrons, RJR has developed a variety of
materials for restaurants, bars and other establishments. These materials include:

e window decals indicating that smokers and nonsmokers are welcome;

e coasters, napkins and matchbooks with humorous smoking/nonsmoking
scenarios; and

e informational booklets to assist owners and managers with various

smoking/nonsmoking issues.
Case Studies - Demonstrated Techniques That Work

Model Restaurant Program -- Working with a select number of restaurants in three cities,
RJR has instituted a model restaurant program and developed case studies from the
results. Over the course of three months, RJR supplied the materials on an ongoing basis,
distributed surveys to patrons and worked to improve ventilation systems. Following
ventilation adjustments, owners have found a substantial improvement in indoor air
quality.

Ventilation

In addition to the case studies, RJR has produced a ventilation guide, "Jmproving
Restaurant Ventilation." A thorough and detailed handbook, the guide offers specific
suggestions and practical tips for bar and restaurant owners and managers on improving
air quality and comfort.

Based on the practical and technical advice presented in the ventilation guide, RJR
implemented pilot programs to test ways to improve indoor air quality in six bars and
restaurants in different parts of the country. RJR engineers and outside professional
engineers contracted by RJR, used simple new systems, inexpensive upgrades and proper
maintenance to existing systems to noticeably improve the air quality in all cases. RJR is
using the results, published in a booklet "Improving Indoor Air Quality," to show
restaurateurs and bar owners that relatively small investments in improving indoor air
quality can pay big dividends in customer and staff satisfaction.

The guide and booklet can be ordered, free of charge, by calling 1-800-528-1228.
