In order to facilitate the execution of these tests, it is imperative that I
receive the estimated shipping and arrival dates of the Mark VII and New Leaf
cigarettes for each city as soon as possible.

Since the competitive Vantage cigarettes must be purchased from the jobbers in

each city, it is also important that I be informed as socom as possible as to the

age or freshness date the Vantage cigarettes must be in order to insure comparability
to the New Leaf and Mark VII Gigarettes.
