Subject: RE: CBS/60 Minutes

An update on a Board of Directors of TITL meeting by telephone today.

A CBS producer by the name of Rebecca Peterson (sp?) located in the Washington office (202-973-0779) called
and asked to film at the TITL Laboratory for a story they are planning for November on low tar cigarettes.

Both RJR and PM were in favor of letting them come in and film without giving an interview while B&W and Lorr.
were not in favor. The reason stated for not being in favor was that this was 60 Minutes and nothing good could
come from it.

Further discussion resulted in the following action: Mara Payne of RJR will telephone the producer to acquire
more details of the requested filming and report back to the Board of Directors early next week. In any event,
there was strong sentiment that TITL not speak for the industry, however, if individual Companies wanted to grant
an interview, they were free to do so.

| will provide you with more details as | receive them. It would appear that we at PM need to decide if we are going
to grant an interview with this producer and plan to proceed accordingly.
