Dear Dr. Ford,

AS per your suggestion yesterday, I am sending you this note to
inform you of my intent to resubmit my proposal entitled, "Splenic
Fibroblast Subsets Mediate B lymphocyte Survival", for the
November, 1994 deadline. I am appreciative of the encouragement
you provided. While my proposal did not achieve a fundable priority
score, the reviewers were nonetheless very enthusiastic about the
project. I know I can improve it substantially by November.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely yours,

ick Plagy
