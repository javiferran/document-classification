CAMEL SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES REPORT
Week of 3/12/84

 

1) Focus groups were conducted in Dallas, TX last week to assess
consumer reaction to CAMEL's recently approved Style Awareness
and Relatability advertising approaches. A total of five
groups were conducted among both male and female 18-34 year
old competitive smokers. Overall, consumer reaction to both
advertising approaches was very positive, and both were
effective in communicating their intended messages. The
focus groups also generated discussion of consumers' current
perceptions about CAMEL and confirmed: the need for increasing
overall brand style awareness. A full report of findings
from these groups will be forwarded the week of 3/19.

2) The CAMEL team Positioning Process Hypothesis Development
meeting was held on 3/14 at the Graylyn Conference Center.
This meeting served as the initial stage of development for
reassessment of the brand's current positioning as defined
by MDD's new positioning process. As next steps, MDD will
specifically investigate each hypothesis generated using
available data sources, Their findings will be presented
to the brand team in April, after which implication to the
brand's current positioning will be assessed.
