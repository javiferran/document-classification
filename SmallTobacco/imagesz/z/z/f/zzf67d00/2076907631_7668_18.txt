PRIORITY

Report B1041 / P 0500/3213 97/11/12 Page 15

Due to technical reasons, it was necessary to interrupt the daily exposure of one or more

 

groups for short intervals. Since these interruptions were shorter than 36 min (10 % of the daily
exposure time), the daily exposure was extended for the respective groups accordingly - with
the exception of the lowest and highest 1R4F groups, where in one instance 19 min of

exposure were not compensated for.

In order to characterize the test atmospheres as well as to check the reproducibility of the

mainstream smoke generation, relevant analytical parameters were determined at appropriate

intervals. (Table 5).
