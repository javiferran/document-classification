1 2 Objective

2 In the present 90-day inhalation study on rats, the biological activity of mainstream smoke of

3 the test cigarettes VIRGO-CA and VIRGO-CC was determined and compared to that of the

4 standard reference cigarette 1R4F. The —_ or persistence of test substance-related

5 effects was investigated. ple oe Sy tae" le ow 4; ,

10 This 90-day inhalation study on male and female Sprague Dawley rats was performed in basic

11. conformity with OECD guideline 413 (1981), the major exception was the use of 2 dose levels

12 d per test cigarette instead of 3. For the reference cigarette, 4 gpse levels were used to enable a ut gel

16 groups and the nee uP there was a postinhalation period of 42 days to

19 investigate the reversibility or persistence of test substance-related effects *. This time period is

20 commonly used in subchronic mainstream smoke inhalation studies on rats (e. g., CRC/INBIFO

21 ~~ study B1035 / P 0500/3182, 1994; Coggins et al., 1989).

23 Cigarettes were smoked in basic conformity with !SO standards, with some defined deviations

24 ° being necessary for technical reasons. 1R4F mainstream smoke was diluted with filtered, ho

25 conditioned fresh air to obtain 4 concentrations (Table 1) that were expected to produce 3

26 histopathological changes in the respiratory tract comparable in type and gradation to those 2

* Delayed occurrence of effects in subchronic MS inhalation studies has not been reported in published

literature and was not expected based on our experience. Accordingly, delayed occurance of effects
was only investigated for all high dose groups of this study.
