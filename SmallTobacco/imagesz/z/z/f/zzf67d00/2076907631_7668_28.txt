Hematological determinations were performed on 10 male and 10 female rats per group
immediately prior fo dissection after 90 and 132 days«Table 8). During the 90-day dissection,
hematology samples were obtained from the aorta subsequent to blood sample collection for
clinical chemistry. Approximately 1 ml blood was collected in EDTA-coated test tubes from
pentobarbital-anaesthetized rats by puncturing the abdominal aorta using a small PTFE-tube.
Review of theVliterature as well as the results of our own investigations indicated that
hematology values in the rat can vary depending on the sample collection site (Smith et al.,
1985). Thége samples taken from the aorta gave lower platelet and leukocyte counts than
those from the periorbital sinus Moreover, the hematology parameters are also influenced by
‘the order of blood collection, i.e., the leukocyte values were lower from samples taken from the

orta at the end of the biood sample collection time rather than the beginning of the sample
collection time.| Therefore, the procedure was changed for the 132-day dissection. Then,
approximately imi blood was collected in EDTA-coated test tubes from
pentobarbital-anaesthetized rats by  Pyneturing the retroorbital venous plexus using an

EDTA-coaied glass capillary. The determinations were then made using an automated

electronic cell counter (Sysmex). le clea Lan , LIL x2
