in the present 90-day inhalation study on rats, the biological activity of mainstream smoke of the test
cigarettes VIRGO-CA and VIRGO-CC was determined and compared to that of the standard reference
cigarette 1R4F. .

Male and female Spraque Dawley rats were head only exposed to the mainstream smoke of the research
cigarettes for 6 h/d, 7 d/week. For VIRGO-CA 26 and 49 and for VIRGO-CC 24 and 51 cigarettes/m*
were smoked, which resulted in concentrations of 41 and 89 g total particulate matter (TPM)/ and 38
and 87 pg Te efespectively For the 1R4F dose groups, 6, 12, 17, and 25 cigarettes per m® were
smoked resultingun concentrations of 43, 87, 126, and 171 pg TPM/,respectively. The test and standard
reference cigarettes were smoked in basic conformity with ISO standards with some deviations being
necessary for technical reasons. The mainstream smoke of VIRGO-CA and VIRGO-CC was generated
using heater type A22-K and a 2-phase pulse density-modulated power profile: in the 1st phase 14.45 J
for 0.8 s were applied beginning 0.05 s after start of each 2-s puff, to be followed by 8,55 J for 1.13 s in
the 2nd phase.

On a per cigarette basis, the concentrations of the smoke components determined were lower in VIRGO
than in 1R4F mainstream smoke with the exception of formaldehyde which was higher in VIRGO than in
1R4F mainstream smoke. The aldehyde concentrations in the charcoal filter version were the same as in
the version without charcoal.

The biological effects seen for VIRGO and 1R4F cigarettes did not differ from those observed in
previous mainstream smoke inhalation studies. No mainstream smoke-related mortality was observed.
There were neither remarkable in-life observations nor mainstream smoke-related gross pathological
findings. Yeltow/brown discoloration of fur was observed in all mainstream smoke-exposed groups.

In both high dose VIRGO groups ee and §1 cigarettesfm®) and the highest 1R4F group ae
cigarettes/m3) the body weight gain reduction was statistically significant higher than in the sham-
exposed group.

The basic histopathological findings observed in the VIRGO groups were hyperplasia, squamous
metaplasia, loss of goblet celis concurrent with reserve cell hyperplasia, atrophy as well as increased
epithelial thickness in the larynx and accumulation of pigmented alveolar macrophages. The
histopathological findings were more pronounced in the upper respiratory tract (nose and larynx) than in
the lower respiratory tract (trachea and lungs).

Most of the aforementioned findings were seen in previous prototype studies (CRC/INBIFO studies
B1033 / P 0500/3204, 1994; B1032 / P 0500/3197, 1995; B1044 / P 0500/3238, 1997) at cormparable
mainstream smoke concentrations.

The biological activity of VIRGO-CA 26 and 49 cig./m3 and VIRGO-CC 24 and 51 cig./m3 was similar to
that seen at 1R4F 18 and 23 cig./m3, respectively. On average the VIRGO mainstream smoke had
approximately 1/3 the activity of the 1R4F mainstream smoke an a per cigarette basis. Some statistically
significant biological effects (reduction in body weight gain, histopathological changes mainly in the nose
and the larynx) were found in the groups which were exposed to the highest concentrations of the test
and reference cigarettes.

During the postinhalation period, almost complete reversal was observed for the histopathological
changes in the nose, larynx, trachea, and Jungs.
