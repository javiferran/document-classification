For all smoke-exposed groups, the mainstream smoke was diluted with filtered, conditioned

 

fresh air immediately downstream from the pump (Figure 1 and Figure 2). For the two lowest
1R4F concentration groups (6 and 12 cig./m*), the mainstream smoke was further diluted in a

2nd step (Figure 1).

For the 1R4F groups, the target numbers of cigarettes smoked per volume test atmosphere
were 6, 13, 19, and 26 cigarettes/ 3 The actual smoke concentrations were 6, 12, 18, and
23 cigarettes/m’*. For both-AARGO groups, the target was 26 and 52 cigarettesim*Cfest ~
atmosphere; The actual smoke concentrations were 26 and 49 cigarettes/m® for VIRGO-CA
and 24 and 51 cigarettes/m* for VIRGO-CC (Table 1). All evaluations were based on the actual

smoke concentrations.

The mainstream smoke was conveyed via a minimal length of glass tubing from the smoking
machines to the exposure chambers, approximately 4m for the VIRGO groups and 11m for
aes the 1R4F groups, corresponding to a volume of 21 and 61, respectively. The flow through the
exposure chambers was between 66 and 88 i/min, which corresponds ie(Sto 4 iat * min) in Scbbect if
the low dose groups (20 rats per group) ane Wort + min) in the high dose and sham-exposed
groups (40 rats per group). The mean age of the mainstream smoke in the exposure chambers

was 9 to 13 s.

4 All heaters were replaced after 6 days of use, equivalent to approximately 270 cigarettes per
wo” ” heater. Due to technical problems with the heater gocket (size and shape of connector pins
“ twlrant jufo J

t* were not optimized) the number of insertions per heater and heater board were limited to
w Se .
4 cycles. Therefore, the heater boards were used with at maximum 4 different heaters. The
heater sets (heaters and heater boards) A4, B4, and D3 were used for at least 12 days without
disassembling to investigate the heater performance. The results of the analytical

determinations in thefmainstream smoke did not change during this period.

 

if up to 10 % of heater blades on one smoking machine did malfunction, the dilution air was
adjusted accordingly. When more than 10 % of the heater blades functioned improperly, ail

defect heaters were replaced.
