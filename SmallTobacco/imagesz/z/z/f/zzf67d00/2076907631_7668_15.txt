The VIRGO test cigarettes were conditioned according to [SO standard 3402 (1991). The
mainstream smoke was generated using 4 modified 30-port INBIFO smoking machines (type
USM85) equipped with a 4-piston pump and 30 electric heaters * (Figure 2) using a 2-phase
pulse density-modulated heating mode. The mean heating energy and the smoking conditions

are shown in Table 4 and Figure 3.
