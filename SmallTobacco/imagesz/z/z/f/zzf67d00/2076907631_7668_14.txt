The sham-exposed and the high concentration-exposed satellite groups were kept in cages for

 

a 42-day postinhalation period.

The 90-day inhalation period was from 6 Nov.96 to 3 Feb.97 and the 42-day postinhalation
period was from 4 Feb.97 to 17 Mar.97.

The research cigarettes were smoked in basic conformity wid {SO standard 3308 (1991)

regarding the puff duration, volume, and frequency among other parameters. Some minor

defined deviations from the ISO standards, e.g., rectangular puff profile, free (open-end)

smoking, and air velocity were necessary for technical reasons.

eee â€œThe 1R4F reference cigarette was conditioned according to ISO standard 3402 coon f he
mainstream smoke was generated using 2 separate 30-port INBIFO smoking machines
(type SM85) equipped with a 4-piston pump (Figure 1). The smoking conditions are shown in
Table 3. The diluted mainstream smoke of each smoking machine was split to generate the low

concentrations of the 1R4F groups in a 2nd dilution step.
