4 Statistics and Evaluation

 

For the analytical assays, detection limits were determined using methods based on the
sensitivity/reproducibility specified by the suppliers for the analytical equipment (e.g., carbon
monoxide analyzer) or based on repetitive determinations of blanks or on calculations from the

calibration curves and their confidence limits (nicotine, aldehydes).

As descriptive statistics, the number of values, a mean value (6.g., the arithmetic mean), and a
measure of variance (e.g., the standard error of the mean) were given for all continuous data
(e.g., BW and thickness of laryngeal Epithelm . For data sets which include a measured vaiue
below the detection limit, the median, 25,and 75 % quartiles were given. Values below the
detection limit were graphically presented as zero. For ordinal data (e.g., histopathological

data), the arithmetic mean, the standard error of the mean, and the incidences were given.

= The particle size distribution was calculated using linear regression analysis after probit
transformation of the cumulative frequencies and logarithmic transformation of the aerodynamic

diameter values (Finney, 1971).
The following statistical evaluations were performed on the biological data:

Comparison of biological activity of each VIRGO type and 1R4F using the following procedure:
(Figure 9)

- calculation of a dose-response curve of 1R4F using nonlinear regression analysis with the
b

power function y = ax? +c

- calculation of the relative biological activity of the 2 VIRGO types compared to 1R4F as

 

â€˜

dose ratios for equal biological effects of 1R4F and each dose level of each VIRGO type,
the equal effect 1R4F doses Fi Me4 calculated using the above-mentioned regression

curve.
