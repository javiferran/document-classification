Most of the aforementioned findings were seen in previous prototype studies (CRC/INBIFO
studies B1033 / P 0500/3204, 1994; B1032 / P 0500/3197, 1995; B1044 / P 0500/3238, 1997)

at comparable mainstream smoke concentrations.

The biological activity of VIRGO-CA 26 and 49 cig.m? and VIRGO-CC 24 and 51 cig./m® was
similar to that seen at 1R4F 18 and 23 cig./m*, respectively. On average, the VIRGO
mainstream smoke had approximately 1/3 the activity of the 1R4F mainstream smoke on a per
cigarette basis. Some statistically significant biological effects (reduction in BW gain,
histopathological changes mainly in the nose and the larynx) were found in the groups which

were exposed to the highest concentrations of the test and reference cigarettes.

Almost Cc reversal was observed for the findings in larynx, trachea, and lungs.
