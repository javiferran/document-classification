Parameter Principle/Method
urea concentration photometric determination of NADH after enzymatic reduction of

a-ketoglutarate to glutamate in the presence of ammonium ions
cleaved from urea by urease

creatinine concentration photometric determination of a creatinine picrate complex

bilirubin concentration photometric determination of azobilirubin (direct and total)

protein concentration photometric determination of a dye complex formed between peptide
bonds and copper ions in alkaline solution (Biuret method)

total cholesterol photometric determination of the reaction product of 4-amino -

concentration phenazone, phenol, and H2O.

HO, is produced during enzymatic oxidation of cholesterol
triglyceride photometric determination of the reaction product of 4-aminophena-
concentration zone, 4-chlorophenol, and H2O.; HzO, is produced during enzymatic

oxidation of glycerol-1-phosphate after enzymatic cleavage of trigly-

aS cerides and phosphorylation of glycerol

Remarks: determination in serum

For pathological evaluation, on days 90 to 94, 10 male and 10 female rats per group were
anaesthetized with pentobarbital (30 mg/kg BW), killed by exsanguination, and dissected under

supervision of a pathologist (Table 10).

Gross pathological findings were recorded and the organ weights 7 determined (Table 11).
Lungs with larynx and trachea were removed together and fixed with EAFS solution by
intratracheal instillation and subsequent immersion. Testes were fixed in Bouin’s solution,
sternum in Schaffer’s solution, and all other organs in 10 % buffered formaldehyde solution. A

the 132-day dissection the eyes were fixed in Davidson’s fixative.

 

The quotient organ weight/body weight was caiculaded on the basis of body weight after oo
exsanguination. _
