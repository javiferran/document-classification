prior to dissection (Table 9). There was no prior diet deprivation *. Approximately 5 ml blood

were collected in plastic test tubes from pentobarbital-anaesthetized rats by puncturing the

abdominal aorta using a small PTFE tube. After coagulation (6 °C, 15 min) and centrifugation

(10 min, 4500 x g) of the blood, the serum was stored at 4 °C and most clinical biochemical

® Diet was not deprived, because it may have an influence on organ weights (e.g., fiver). It would also
complicate a comparison with previous daia generated without diet deprivation.
