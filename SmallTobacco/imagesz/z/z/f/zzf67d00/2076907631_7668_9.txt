3.2. Animals and Treatment

10 Outbred Sprague Dawley rats (Cri:CDBR), bred under specified pathogen-free conditions, were
11. obtained from Charles River Wiga, Germany. This breeder was chosen based on the actual
12 health status of the rat colonies. Sprague Dawley rats were used due to our extensive
_ 13 experience with them in mainstream smoke inhalation studies and the large amount of
oe 14 published data on this strain (e.g., IARC, 1986). :

16 The rats were kept and exposed in an animal laboratory with restricted access (CRC modular
17 lab units C119, C120, C125, C126, C127, C128) under defined hygienic conditions. The
18 laboratory air was filtered, conditioned fresh air. Positive pressure was maintained inside the
19 faboratory. The room temperature and relative humidity were maintained at 22 °C (SD: 1) and
20 64% (SD: 4). The light/dark cycle was 12 h/12 h.
