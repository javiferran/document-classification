in the present 90-day inhaiation study on rats, the biological activity of mainstream smoke of
the test cigarettes VIRGO-CA and VIRGO-CC was determined and compared to that of the

standard reference cigarette 1R4F.

Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were head-only exposed to ag yonsteam smoke GF)
the research cigarettes for 6 hid, 7 diweek. For VIRGO-CA, Sar Vida for VIRGO-CC, 26 ,
and 51 cigarettes/m*® were smoked, which resulted in wcoetatond of 44 and 89 uo tot
particulate matter (TPM)/ and 38 and 87 ug TPMA, respectively. For the 1R4F dose groups, 6,
10 12, 17 and 25 cigarettes/m? were smoked resulting in concentrations of 43, 87, 126, and
11 171 ug TPMA, respectively. The test and standard reference cigarettes were smoked in basic
12 conformity with iSO standards with some deviations being necessary for technical reasons. The
. 13 mainstream smoke of VIRGO-CA and VIRGO-CC was generated using heater type A22-K and
— 14 a 2-phase pulse density-modulated power profile: in the 1st phase 14.45 J were applied for
15  0.8s beginning 0.05 s after stari of each 2-s puff, to be followed by 8.55 J for 1.13 s in the 2nd
16 ~~ phase.

18 Ona per cigarette basis, the concentrations of the smoke components determined were lower
79 in VIRGO than in 1R4F mainstream smoke with the exception of formaldehyde which was
~v higher in VIRGO than in 1R4F mainstream smoke. The aldehyde concentrations in the charcoal

21 __ filter version were the same as in the version without charcoal.

23 The biological effects seen for VIRGO and 1R4F cigarettes did not differ from those observed in
24 previous mainstream smoke inhalation studies. No mainstream smoke-related mortality was
25 observed. There were neither remarkable in-life observations nor mainstream smoke-related
26 gross pathological findings. Yellow/brown discoloration of fur was observed in all mainstream

27 smoke-exposed groups.
