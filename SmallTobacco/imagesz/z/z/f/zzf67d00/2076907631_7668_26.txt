3.4 Biological Parameters

The biologica! parameters investigated were chosen according to OECD guideline 413 (OECD,

1981) with special emphasis on the histopathology of the respiratory tract.

Mortality and in-life observations were recorded daily whereas food consumption and BW were
determined weekly during the inhalation period (Table 7).

To provide an estimate of the smoke dose and concentration inhaled, selected respiratory
physiology parameters, the steady-state blood carboxyhemogiobin proportion, and various
nicotine metabolites in the urine were determined. Due to technical problems during the
determination of the respiratory parameters only the respiratory frequency could be used for

further evaluation.

Ophthalmological examinations were performed on all rats (260) before the start of the
inhalation period and on all rats of the sham and high dose groups (160) at the end of the

inhalation period.
