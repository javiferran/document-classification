dose groups with the exception of CO, glycerol, formaldehyde, anc-particie-size. CTABE ©).

The mean CO concentrations of the low and the high dose VIRGO groups were 3.4- to 1.6-fold
lower than the CO concentration of the lowest IR4F group (1R4F-8), respectively (Table 6 and
Figure 5).

The glycerol concentrations of the low dose VIRGO groups were comparable to that of
1R4F-18, whereas the glycerol concentrations of the high dose VIRGO groups were 1.6-
to 1.7-fold higher than that of the highest 1R4F group (1R4F-23) (Table 6 and Figure 7).

The formaldehyde concentrations were 4- to 9- fold higher in the fow and high dose VIRGO
groups, respectively, than in the highest 1R4F groups (1R4F-23) (Table 6 and Figure 8).

The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the VIRGO smoke particles was 1.1-
to 1.3-fold smaller than that of the 1R4F smoke (0.57 to 0.60 um for the 1R4F groups and
0.48 to 0.52 ym for the VIRGO groups). In the present study the MMADs for 1R4F were higher
than in previous studies, this was caused by the use of a Battelle pump for the smoke
generation (INBIFO study P 0500,5272, 1994). The particle size distribution in the VIRGO
smoke was wider than that in the 1R4F smoke, as indicated by higher geometrical standard

deviations (GSD) for the VIRGO MS (1.7 um for IR4F and 1.8 to 1.9 um for VIRGO), [pegrel. oun, PER ge.

There were no differences in the concentrations of all selected smoke components between the

VIRGO cigarettes with and without charcoal filter (Table 6).
