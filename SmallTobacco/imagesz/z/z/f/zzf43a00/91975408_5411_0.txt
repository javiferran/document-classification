SUBJECT: STRATEGY LETTER:
1996 - NEWPORT LIGHTS HEAVY-UP TEST

The fallowing outlines the details for the planned Newport Lights
heavy-up test beginning April 8, 1996.

BACKGROUND

In evaluating the Full-Price, Lotar Menthol segment of the
marketplace, it appears that there is potential for growth for
Newport Lights. Compared to competitive Lights brands, Newport
Lights has the third highest volume (Salem and Kool are greater).
In addition, the chart below shows that Lights contributes a
smaller percentage of business to the overall Newport franchise
than our competitors.

Newport is a heavily Urban Center driven brand, while its key
competition is either more evenly split between General Market and
Urban Center, or is. General Market driven. This creates a
disadvantage for Newport Lights, because the Lotar Menthol category
is heavily dominated by the General Market. Since Newport Lights
is underdeveloped vs. this target audience, we feel that there may
be an opportunity to build Newport Light’s business by increasing
the brand’s presence in the 3eneral Market.

Therefore, starting April 8, 1996, we will implement a Newport
Lights heavy-up test in two test markets. The objective of the
program is to determine business building opportunities for Newport
Lights in the General Market. The test will strive to increase
brand awareness and marketplace presence by utilizing a combination
of a distribution drive and increased/specialized marketing support
in the form of Advertising and Promotion.
