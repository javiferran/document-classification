SAMPLING

Show samples will be available for the Box 80's and Box 100's
packings.

MERCHANDISING

The merchandising objective is to increase Lights visibility
at retail, by implementing the following:

~- Increase the number of facings for Lights to 50% of top
tray on 2 tray displays, and 100% of top tray for 3
tray displays.

- Use specially designed “Lights only" POS for added
awareness at retail (see Exhibit A for POS list).

- Utilize a 40 Pack display, 80 Pack display and Dump Bin
display specifically designed for Lights for increased
retail presence. However, we will use the corporate (gold)
version of the pedestal display for cost efficiencies.

- Newport Lights should be the first temporary display placed
in temporary locations. Newport Parent should be placed
when a second temporary display can be merchandised.

MARKET SUPPORT

Newport Lights will be the featured brand during the 6 month heavy-
up test. However, Newport Parent’s promotional activity does not

cease in the marketplace (see Exhibit B for a flowchart of both
brands’ activity).

ADVERTISING

An introductory advertising campaign utilizing COH as the only
vehicle (to maximize reach) will kick off April 1996. The first 2
months of the test will feature strong showing levels (#150) and
the next 4 months will continue with sustaining levels (#100).

Advertising creative will treat Lights as a Newport line extension.
The executions will borrow Newport's image equity, yet will
differentiate Lights from Parent by using different signature
colors and focusing on smoking situations. The creative also will
communicate a lighter menthol alternative to our target audience by
featuring the tagline "Lighter Menthol Pleasure". To support the
distribution drive, a Box 80 packing will be featured in all
creative. An Advertising Smoke Signal introducing the creative and
specifics of the media plan will be issued prior to rollout.
