PROMOTION

A 6 month introductory level promotion plan, designed to generate
heavy trial and encourage on-going repeat purchase will begin on
April 8, 1995. Please refer to the flowchart (Exhibit B) for
specific timing. The components of the program are as follows:

- Savings
In order to maintain consistency of value with Newport Parent
(both Grand Rapids and Peoria are Tier IV markets), $.40 pack
coupons and $4.00 carton coupons will be used at retail to
initiate trial. Quantities were determined by taking 20% of
Newport Parent Red Book quantities.

Coverage for all savings promotions will be 100% of all visible
Newport Lights stock on permanent, temporary and self-service
displays.

- BIGIF ,
A BIG1F promotion will run simultaneously with pack and carton
savings to aggressively target competitive smokers. The BIGIF
promotion will be provided for Newport Lights only, during
the Apr/May and Aug/Sep periods. Quantities were determined by
taking 50% of Newport Parent Red Book quantities.

- FSI
Two media delivered FSI‘s will be used tu expand reach and trial
to target smokers beyond the retail environment. The first (free
pack) will drop in May, the second ($1 off 2 packs) will drop in
June. A Smoke Signals will be provided for release prior to the
drop dates.

NEXT STEPS
As agreed, please provide quantities by January 5, 1996. For your
reference, a Newport Lights timetable is attached (Exhibit Cc).
