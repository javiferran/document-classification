Dear Colter:

Thank for your letter of Labor Day. We set off for a
brief family vacation the next day and I have not had a chance to
reply.

We are very familiar with the work of Dx. Thomas since
we have been sponsoring parte of it for quite « number of years.
We are atill helping her with som of the move specifloally psycho~
logical angles but she has now received substantial aid from the
National Institutes of Health. We think she is a very able invea-
tigator. .

I wae intevested in your own article and think it containg
som sound ideas. I will send copies of 1t to mexbers of our study
group on the "psycho~physiclogical aspects of smoking”.

Enclosed is & copy of & paper I wrote some time ago but
vhich gives viewpoints I still hold on experimental approaches to
the lung cancer problem.

Kind regards,

Very sincerely yours, .
