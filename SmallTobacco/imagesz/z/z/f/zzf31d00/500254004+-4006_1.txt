The above WINSTON "Control" is not a true WINSTON but rather the
test biend prior to M-2000 treatment, which is the WINSTON blend without
any casing or G~13 tobacco. TABLE II shows an NL blend versus a true
WINSTON control.

TABLE II - WINSTON Control versus NL Blend

L-8218-A L-8353-A
WINSTON Control NL Blend N.D,
Preference 19 ii 0
Milder 15 14 1
Better Flavor 18 12 9

Both tests show no significant difference in preference; however, the
opinion dof the personnel working on the project is that the difference
between M-2000 processed tobacco and unprocessed tobacco is significant.
This is not a reflection on Booth Panel evaluations in that there is a con-
siderable amount of carry-over off taste and off aroma when comparing a
regular cigarette with a M-2000 processed product, Due to this problem
only a small number of formal panel evaluations were made. Most of the
evaluations were made using a special panel composed of smokers from
Flavoring group, New Products group, and Special Processing group. Two
Company-wide Panel evaluations were made on NL-type products and a large
number of negative comments were received.

From the evaluations of various NL-type cigarettes, the following
observations have been made.

1. Blends without burley have less off taste and off sidestream
aroma.

2. Pentane M-2000 process blends are somewhat more desirable than
freon processed blends.

3. Special top flavors do improve the flavor and aroma of the
products.

4, The menthol product isa more acceptable cigarette than the
regular product.

5. The best NL products developed have a distinctively different
flavor and aroma from regular cigarettes.

6. Charcoal filter improves the flavor of the regular NL-type
product.

The specifications for the regular and menthol products sent to
Marketing for evaluation are shown in Table ITI.
