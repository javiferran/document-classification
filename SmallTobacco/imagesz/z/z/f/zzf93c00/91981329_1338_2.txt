Sales Planning (K. Sparrow memo of 7/21/95 attached) has
indicated that a good portion of the 12 month volume growth being
reported by the Combined Tier #5 Markets (+21% vs. YAG) is due to

Jocated in Tiers #1 thru #4.

The most visible example of this situation is the Lexington, KY
division. Although this division represents only 9% of Total
Tier #5 volume it accounted for 38% of the Total Tier's 12 month
volume gain versus year-ago.

The growth of Newport shipments into the Lexington, KY division
can be traced to the actions of two direct accounts which now
supply retail accounts outside of this division.

In June 1994 monthly volume at the division's largest account
D.E. Miskell suddenly doubled. And in March 1995 McLane opened a
warehouse in Cumberland, KY. The impact of these two accounts on
the division's monthly MSA shipment trends was significant.
