Since Cigarette sales in large supermarkets have been declining
over time a better measure of Newport's growth in the IRI tiers
may be changes in the brand's market share.

Similar to the MSA shipment and IRI volume data, a comparison of
Newport's market share versus year-ago indicates strong growth,
especially in Tiers #3-#5.
