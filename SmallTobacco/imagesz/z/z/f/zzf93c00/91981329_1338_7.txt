Kool's 12 month "volume Percent Change versus Year-Ago" of +2%
remains overstated. Kool's volume has remained relatively stable
at 17.6 billion units for the last 11 months. However this level
is still below the 18-19 billion unit level which the brand was
shipping prior to the August 1993 industry-wide price
restructuring.
