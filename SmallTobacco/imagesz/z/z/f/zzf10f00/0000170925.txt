Memorandum

To: M. J. Novak

ce: B. L. McCafferty ~
5, Cush

From: 4. G. Forsythe

Date: July 5, 1979

Given that 151 12M cases of RICH LIGIITS Kings and 189 cases
of RICH LIGHTS 10's have been produced with complimentary
closures and must be used in the near future, the Brand Group
concurs with your recommendation that this product be used to
target local events and support field sales activities. We do
believe that a well thought out plan should be developed and
approved by the Brand Group for distribution of these cigarettes.

Thank you for apprising us of this situation and we expect a
completed ptan by the week of July 13.
