that the average exposures are orders of magnitude less than

exposures represented by smoking a single cigarette."

Reaction to the smoking ban has been widespread. The day the law

went into effect, a smokers’ rights group protested at National

Airport in Washington, D.C., gaining national attention. The
Department of Transportation's Office of Consumer Affairs has
ceceived thousands of letters from those unhappy with this
measure. And, the hundreds of unselicitied letters and
unprecedented volume of phone calls to The Tobacco Institute from

upset smokers and nonsmokers tell us that people indeed do not

like what is happening.

When Northwest Airlines surpassed the law and banned smoking on
all its North American flights, anti-smoking activists predicted
it would result in more passengers. Not so, according to the
Wall Street Journal and Northwest’s own records. In fact, for
the two months of operation without passenger smoking,
Northwest's revenue passenger miles have declined when compared
to the same period one year ago. Other major airlines have

reported increases for these months.

The debate over smoking aboard airlines will continue -- the law

now in place expires a year from next. So those voicing a call

For return to accommodation of both nonsmokers and smokers have a

chance to see it happen.
