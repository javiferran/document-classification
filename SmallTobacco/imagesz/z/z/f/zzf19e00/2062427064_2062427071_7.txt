Why is it my responsibility to stop minors from smoking?

Clearly, the law and our communities holds retailers responsible for the sale of tobacco products to
minors and Ask First/It's the Law demonstrates to everyone that this issue is being handled
responsibly. All of us, retailers, Philip Morris, educators, lawmakers, communities, and parents, have
some role to play. It's your responsibility to prevent minors access to tobacco products at retail.

Minors aren’t really a problem for me. | don’t get many trying to purchase.

That’s great. But we need to join together to show our community that all of us are serious about
preventing the sales of cigarettes to minors. Eventually, most retailers will be displaying this sign, or
some kind of sign, and you'll want to be included among them as being a responsible retailer.

| can’t contro! what my employees do when I’m not here.

If you take steps to ensure that they are aware of the law and you tell them it is against store policy to
sell to minors, and that they could lose their job if they do, you probably could control what they do
regarding sales to minors. This program also makes it easier for you to help them comply with the
law.

I like the old sign better. I already have it up.
If you like the old sign better, then keep it up. The goal is to help prevent cigarette sales to minors.
