INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE
Richmond, Virginia
To: -John Paine Date: 18 April 1989
From: Karen Sanders

Subject: .Structural and Elemental Documentation of Ca,,_ (OH), (POu) 6,
CaHPO,:°2H,0, and CaHPo,

Three dry powder chemicals were submitted for structural and elemental
determinations.

Sample #8750-90-A, Ca,, (OH), (PO,)¢, contained round particles 0.02 -
0.15 in diameter (Figure 2). These particles formed clumps up to 3.0L in
diameter (Figure 1). The particles contained P and Ca (Figure 3).

Sample #8750-90-B, CaHPO,-2H,0, contained two different crystal
Structures (Figures 4, 5). The first was round in shape and 0.05 - 0.17p in
diameter (Figure 6). The second type was very angularly-~shaped crystals.
These were from 0.17 - 504 in length and 0.07 - 21 in width (Figures 4, 6).
Both particle types contained P and Ca (Figure 7).

Sample #8750-90-C, CaHPO,, containéd very angular, equant crystals from

1 - 37H in size (Figure 8). On the surfaces of some of these erystals

small, round and equant shaped particles were noted from 0.02 - 0.084 in
size (Figure 9). The crystals contained P and Ca (Figure 10),
