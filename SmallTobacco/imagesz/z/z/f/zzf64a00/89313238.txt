RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT STATUS REPORT

“BATE: FER?4 PROJECT NO: B-448
PROJECT WANE: TOBACCO [ON CHROMATOGRAPHY i710}

i
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Cisarette smcke anions and low molecular weight covalent solecules converted into anions will be analyzed. Analytes will be
resolved hy 1, then detected electrachesicaily and by vacancy UV. Tons of interest are X0(2)-,NO(3)-,C1(-1, carboxylates, and
covaleat nolecules, NOx} SU(x) HEN,H(2}S,HCRO, and CHIZ)CHO. Collection methods will be explored to expand analyte range and
trapping reliability. Novel cigarette construction. encompassing blend, filler and filter additive effects, will be tested.
Modifications will be correlated with ion grofiles, independent chemical analyses, and biological activity assays. Cation analyses
Will explore alkali groug,NH(4}+ and nicotinium ion cantributions ta mew cigarettes. Transition aetal ion analyses will be pursued.
If will continue to serve ether aroups. fons, such as Ch{-},Br(-) HPOU4)=,NO(3)-,ND(2)-, and citrate, will be analyzed in tobacco
grades, unsaoked cigarettes, FL, other production components and aatrices af savironmental iaport to aid in cigarette sodification,
quality aanagement and process decision paking.

Anion orefile determinations af four separate sanplings each of air dried vs. oven (79 deg C) - dried RLT-4d filler composite 113.5 1
lb scale-up) sheets completed. Overall, there apnears to be a random effect on anion levels in air vs. heat dried material, thus
supporting reliability af further work with RLT-46. Tests on aunicioal tap water prompted by high pH (approxisately 7.5-7.7):
