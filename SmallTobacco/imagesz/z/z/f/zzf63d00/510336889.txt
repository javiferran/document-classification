SUBJECT: FUTURE DEVELOPMENT: PRICE-CONSCIOUS AND
PRESTIGE CATEGORIES

The following white paper by Doug Weber discusses the future development of
the Price-Conscious and Prestige categories. This document is in response to
your request for a â€œthink piece" on how these two categories might develop in
the next five years.

In the document three separate scenarios are discussed. Each scenario differs
in the amount of growth achieved by the Price-Conscious and Prestige
categories by 1988. These variations are supported by hypotheses regarding
industry competitive actions and reactions, marketing resource availability,
technical capabilities, and economic and social pressures facing cigarette
consumers.

Also included is a description of factors that may impact the likelihood of
each scenario and the future development of the market.

Finally, we have included specific recommendations for RJR. These
recommendations address the need to:

1. Prevent the occurrence of an RJR competitive disadvantage in the
Price-Conscious category. Specifically, we need to be prepared to
introduce new Price-Conscious brands, plot potential competitive
moves, and increase our intelligence activities to ensure ourselves
maximum lead-times.

2. Explore all possible opportunities and positions within the Prestige
category.

3. Place high priority on the development of products and other elements
of our marketing mix that will provide us superior brand propositions
and competitive advantages. This could be done through improved
technologies, more efficient distribution systems, and more effective
promotional tools.

As you requested, this document has been reviewed by Marty Orlowsky and Harry
Lees.
