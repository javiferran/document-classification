Rudman Interim Report

Attached is the Rudman Interim Report on AAA for our comment and feedback.
Please review as soon as possible so that we may respond with our comments to the
Senator.

I would appreciate your sending all comments to me as soon as possible so that we
can get back to the Senator's office and the report can be issued.

While I will be on vacation next week, please forward any comments on e-mail and
I will check them from home. If I can get this back to Rudman before the holiday
weekend, I would like to.
