HORIZON (VANILLA SCENT, FULL CIRCUMFERENCE — ATLANTA

Scanning supermarkets report shares in the 0.8 - 0.9 range,
with 81% of stores currently selling. While reported
incidence of supermarket promotions has been nominal, pack
offers (B1G1F and $1.00 off 2 packs) were reported earlier
in the market, but appear to have been largely exhausted.

Note that distributor data reached a high of 0.8 during
August, largely spurred by promotional product. Most
recently, during September, share has declined to the
0.2/0.3 level, similar to performance during the first half
of June. Shipments place the brand at 0.5.

Attached is a sample of new advertising for Horizon which
began during September. This ad is a departure from the
black and white testimonial ads run earlier in the

introduction. HORIZON
