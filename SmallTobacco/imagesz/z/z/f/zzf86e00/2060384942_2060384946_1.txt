KOOL DELUXE (HOUSTON & HAWAIT)

In Hawaii (June/July) Supermarket Scanning places Kool
Deluxe at 1.4 with 89% of stores selling. In both Hawaii
and Houston, distributor data register the brand at the
0.9/0.8 level.

Note that immediately proceeding the Deluxe introduction in
Houston, shipments stopped for the old Lts/Ultras
Kings/100’s packings.

While retail audits have stopped for Kool Deluxe in Houston,
key account convenience activity has generally remained
consistent, averaging at 0.6, and distributor performance
has in fact increased due to reported carton displays and
BiG1IF offers. Supermarket scanning reports somewhat lower
levels at 0.4 with 69% of stores carrying at least one
packing.
