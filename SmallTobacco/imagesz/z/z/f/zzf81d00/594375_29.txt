Company generally of rights, options, or warrants (expiring within 45 days after the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to receive them) to subscribe for shares of Common Stock of the
Company at less than 95% of the current market price (as defined); or the distribution to the holders of
shares of Common Stock of the Company generally of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding cash
dividends and distributions payable out of unrestricted surplus in accordance with Texas law or earned
surplus and dividends or other distributions payable in Common Stock or other stock of the Company)
—Or rights, options, or warrants to subscribe for securities of the Company other than those mentioned above.
No adjustment in the exercise price will be required to be made with respect to the warrants until cumulative
adjustments amount to one percent or more of the exercise price, however, any such adjustment not
required to be made will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment.

In the event of any capital reorganization, certain reclassifications of the shares of Common Stock
of the Company, any consolidation or merger involving the Company (other than a consolidation or merger
which does not result in any reclassification or change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock), or sale
of the properties and assets of the Company as, or substantially as, an entirety to any other corporation,
each Warrant would thereupon become exercisable only for the number of shares of stock or other
securities, assets, or cash to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company
purchasable (at the time of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, or sale) upon
exercise of such Warrant would have been entitled upon such reorganization, reclassification,
consolidation, merger, or sale. In the case of a cash merger of the Company into another corporation or
any other cash transaction of the type mentioned above, the effect of these provisions would be that the
holder of a Warrant would thereafter be limited to exercising such Warrant at the exercise price in effect
at such time for the amount of cash per share that a Warrantholder would have received had such holder
exercised such Warrant and received shares of Common Stock of the Company immediately prior to the
effective date of such cash merger or transaction. Depending upon the terms of such cash merger or
transaction, the aggregate amount of cash so received could be more or less than the exercise price of the
Warrant.

the consent of any Warrantholder to supplement or amend the Warrant Agreement in order to cure any
ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision contained therein which may be defective or inconsistent
with any other provisions therein, or to make any other provisions in regard to matters or questions arising
thereunder which the Company and the Warrant Agent may deem necessary or desirable and which does
not adversely affect the interests of the Warrantholders.
