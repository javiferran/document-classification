Incentive Stock Option Plans

On January 5, 1984, the Company’s Board of Directors and shareholders adopted the Advanced
Tobacco Products, Inc. 1984 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the “ATP Pian”), which authorizes the granting
of stock options covering a maximum of 310,000 shares of Common Stock to officers and key management
employees of the Company, subject to reduction to 270,000 under the circumstances described below. The
Board of Directors may grant options to eligible participants upon such terms as the Board of Directors
May determine in its sole discretion, so long as consistent with the terms and purposes of the ATP Plan.
Members of the Board of Directors are eligible to participate in the ATP Plan provided they are employees
and do not participate in the decision or vote of the Board of Directors concerning the grant, purchase price,
or other terms of any option of which they are a recipient. Under the ATP Plan, the exercise price per share
cannot be less than 100% (or 110% in the case of options granted to holders of 10% or more of the then
outstanding Common Stock) of the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock as determined by
the Board of Directors on, and the exercise period for the option cannot exceed ten years from, the date
the option is granted. An option granted under the ATP Plan may be exercised only after one year of
continued employment by the Company immediately following the date of grant of the option. Upon the
first annual anniversary of the date of grant, options shall be exercisable with respect to 25% of the
underlying shares and thereafter options may become exercisable with respect to no more than 25% of the
underlying shares per year. Options granted under the ATP Plan are not transferable except by will or the
laws of descent or distribution and are exercisable only if the optionee, unless retired, deceased or disabled,
is employed by the Company at the time of exercise. No stock option has been granted under the ATP Plan.

In April, 1983, the Company adopted its §. A. Vend, Inc. 1983 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the
*S. A. Vend Plan”). The terms of the S. A. Vend Plan are substantially the same as the ATP Plan except
that options may be granted by the Board of Directors of the Company under the S. A. Vend Pian without
restriction as to time of exercise and may be exercised within 90 days following termination of employment
by the Company without cause. In April, 1983, Mr. Mazur was granted an option under the S. A. Vend
Plan to purchase 887,250 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $.03 per share. Mr. Mazur
exercised his option in whole in September, 1983. Five-year options under the S. A. Vend Plan have been
granted to three other employees, Messrs. Vimond and Simonsen and Dr. Hill. Mr. Vimond’s option covers
93.600 shares at an exercise price of $.025 per share, and is exercisable as to 46,800 shares after August |,
1984 and as to the balance after August 1, 1985. Dr. Hill's option covers 30,000 shares at an exercise price
of $3.25 per share, and is exercisable as to 15,000 shares after November ‘18, 1984 and as to the balance
after November 18, 1985. Mr. Simonsen was granted an option on December 27, 198310 purchase 25,000
shares at an exercise price of $3.50 per share, which is exercisable as to 12,500 shares after December 27,
1984 and as to the balance after December 27, 1985. Mr. Simonsen was granted an option covering an
