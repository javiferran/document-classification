Smokeless Cigarettes per eight hour shift and one production line, decreasing to approximately 16 cents
assuming the manufacturing of 800,000 Smokeless Cigarettes per eight hour shift and four production lines,
which the Company anticipates will be its approximate maximum output per shift. The foregoing unit
manufacturing costs do not include operating costs not directly or indirectly related to manufacturing.
There can be no assurance that the demand for the Smokeless Cigarette will be sufficient to justify the
manufacturing of 800,000 Smokeless Cigarettes per eight hour shift. See “Business — Manufacturing.”

- Selling, Distribution and Marketing Costs. The Company expects to incur significant selling.
distribution and marketing costs to introduce, and to expand and maintain sales of, the Smokeless Cigarette.
The Company’s region-by-region marketing strategy is designed to control such costs, but such costs are
expected to exceed manufacturing costs for the foreseeable future. See “Business — Marketing and
Markets.”

Effect of Federal Cigarette Excise Tax. The Company believes its Smokeless Cigarette will not be
subject to current federal excise taxes applicable to conventional cigarettes. See “Business — Governmental
Regulation and Taxation — Taxation of Cigarettes Under the Internal Revenue Code.” Because the amount
of the current cigarette federal excise tax is calculated by the use of a flat tax rate per thousand cigarettes
manufactured, each pack of six Smokeless Cigarettes manufactured would result in approximately 30%
of the tax imposed on a pack of 20 conventional Class A cigarettes. Therefore, in the event the Smokeless
Cigarettes were taxed under the Internal Revenue Code on the same basis as conventional Class A cigarettes,
each pack of six Smokeless Cigarettes would bear a tax of 4.8 cents.
