NCC GROUP, LTD.
(A Limited Partmership and a Development Stage Enterprise)

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Partnership was formed in August, 1982 as a limited partnership under the Texas Uniform

totalling $500,000 and the general partner’s contribution of $5,051. The limited partners currently share
in any profits or losses in approximately the same percentages as their capital contributions.

The partnership is in the development stage and was organized for the purpose of acquiring all of the
rights and patents to the nicotine vapor delivery system invented by Mr. J. P. Ray, the general partner. The
partners’ capital contributions were to be used primarily to develop the noncombustible cigarette into a
commercially marketable product. Under the terms of the partnership agreement, the partnership has the
exclusive option to acquire the rights and patents in exchange for interests in the partnership. Subsequent
to the exercise of the option, the limited partners will own 10 percent of the partnership and the owners
(including the genera! partner) of the rights and patents (the “technology holders”) will own 90 percent of
the partnership. (See Note 5)
