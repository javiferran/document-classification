Aluminum Foil Adhesive:

a

The Foil Plant requested a different type of adhesive for
adhering Glassine paper to aluminum foil. This type of foil is used
for packing CAMEL 4's for advertising purposes. The present alkaline
adhesive is causing white spots of aluminum oxide or hydroxide to form
on the foil in two to three weeks. A plant test has been made using a
starch ether as an adhesive. The starch ether adhesives were made with
neutral and high pH values. Both adhere to the foil and paper. The
test runs of foil-glassine paper are to be examined from time to time
to determine if’ the white spots are due to moisture alone or to high
alkaline concentration. Other tests are also being planned.

Mr. J. H. Sherrill of the Cigarette Division has requested
an adhesive for adhering Estron (cellulose acetate) to cigarette paper. .
The following formulation has been submitted:

Ethyl Cellulose 22 cps. ween eec ween eeeene 10%
IsoPropyl Alcohol (99%) ---------------"-7- 90%

At present this adhesive is running all right on the machine. Possibly
both some mechanical and formulation changes may be necessary, i.e., a
wider glue line and an adhesive with slightly greater:viscosity. -
