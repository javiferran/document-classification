Filter Tip Cigarettes:

A series of tests have been in progress on filter tip cigarettes.
These tests have consisted of the evaluation of various filtering materials,
and their effect on the smoke of the cigarette, .

Test No. 766 was requested by the Research Department to aid in
the development of a filter tip blend. Cigarettes were made in the plant
with the following codes and specified types of tobacco as controls: (the
controls were all 85 mm cigarettes)

1. No. 7666 ~ Flue cured blend (Camel)

2. ° No. 766K - Burley blend uncased (Camel)

3. No.766Kc — Burley blend cased (Camel)

4. No. 766P.Ay Burley leaf blend uncased (Prince Albert)

Filter tip cigarettes were also made with the same tobaccos, but will not
be tested due to too much variation in the length of the filters,

Chemical analysis of the tobacco and burning time of the control
cigarettes are shown below:

Chemical analysis of the smoke has been made by the Analytical
Division and reported in a separate report,

Test No. 775 comparing Estron tips (cellulose acetate) against
crepe and cellulose tips has been analyzed by the Analytical Division and
reported by them.

Test No. 776 has been discontinued since the tips were not cut

accurately enough for significant analysis,
