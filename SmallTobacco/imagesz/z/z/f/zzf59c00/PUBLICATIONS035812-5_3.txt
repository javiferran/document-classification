IL 2 production in serum-free medium. Because actt-
vation of the T cell receptor ts ultimately reflected by the
expression of the genes coding for IL 2 and the IL 2
receptor. the influence cf senum on iL 2 production was
monitored. For these experiments, the cells were acti-
vated by both anti-T3 and a phorbol ester. as this com-
bination of activating agents ensures maximal concen-
trations of iL 2 In the culture supernatant. The results.
presented In Table Il, reveal a four-fold difference in the
amount of IL 2 produced in serum-supplemented medium
compared with serum-free medium. It is noteworthy that
the cells cultured In semim-free medium received 1 »M
BSA to prevent nonspecific adsorptive loss of any IL 2
produced. and 200 nM TY to allow optimal G, progression
to the S phase. Therefore, the deficient production of It
2 observed when serum Is omitted from the medium
cannot be rectified by supplementation with these con-
centrations of BSA or Tf. In addition, aupraphyalotogic
concentrations of insulin (100 nM to 50 »M) and physto-
legtc concentrations of IGF-1(500 pM to 50 nM) were also
tested. and were found to have no effect on IL 2 produc-
tion.
