Subject: Records Coordinator Training

As you are aware PM USA is implementing a new records management program and the people listed in the
attached file have been appointed Records Coordinators for your respective areas. Records Coordinator
training which lasts a full day will begin in mid September. The training consists of a half day on the new
process and a half day on using the Electronic Récords Management computer system (ERMS). Because
hands on computer training space is limited and therefore scheduling is a little difficult, I need some input from
you all on your Records Coordinators availability.

Please review the dates and times below and let me know which of these sessions they cannot attend.Please
let me know by Tuesday 8/22.. After | here from you all | will notify you and the Records Coordinators on the
sessions they have been scheduled for. If there are any changes fo the list of Records Coordinators please let
me know by 8/30. On August 30th I will be giving the Records Coordinator list to IS so they may begin the
process of granting system permissions to these people.

When attending training, each Records Coordinator should bring a list of people for the departments they will
support. This list will be used by them to begin granting system permission to there people during the hands
on ERMS training. Please help your Records Coordinator procure this list prior to attending the training.

Records Process Training: September 13, 8:30 -12
Records Process Training: September 21, 8:30 -12
ERMS Training:September 13, 1-4:30

ERMS Training:September 22, 8:30 - 12

ERMS Training:September 22, 1-4:30

Thank you for your help.
Mark
