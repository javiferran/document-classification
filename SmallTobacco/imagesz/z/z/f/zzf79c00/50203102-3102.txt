Re: Our Case No. 268
Dear Dr. Chernick:

Your recent inquiry concerning support by this
Council of a proposed research study has now been con-

sidered by the Executive Committee of the Scientific
Advisory Board,

 

The Committee expressed substantial interest in
your proposal and voted to encourage formal application
by you. I take pleasure in enclosing the necessary
forms and relevant literature.

We appreciate your interest. Yeu understand, of
course, that no commitment is implied at this time con-
cerning the final action of our full Scientific Advisory
Board on your complete proposal. If I can help you in
any way in your development of an application, please
let me know.

In order to be processed during our next cycle (for
grants to begin July 1, 1974) an application would have
to be postmarked no later than January 31, 1974.

Sincerely yours,

Robert C. Hockett, Ph.D.
RCHigh Research Director
