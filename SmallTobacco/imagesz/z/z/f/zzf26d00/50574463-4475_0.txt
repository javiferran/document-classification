The magnitude and the k velectro
photoluminescence - EPL. vn the (very low)
electric conductivity of ophores selectively
increase this conductivit er eae te is determined i.a.
by (a) their nature (carrier or channel) and concentration; (b)
the identity and concentration of the translocated ion. As a
result of ionophore action, EPL emission is diminished and often
kinetically altered.

We investigated this phenomenon under various conditions, and
we present : (1) the theoretical background for the evaluation of
ionophore effects from changes in EPL emission; (2) results on
the gramicidin channel and the valinomycin carrier, regarding
their kinetics and ion selectivity.
