SUMMARY

A novel approach to the study of ionophores is presented, ba-
sed upon the special properties of the natural photosynthetic
(thylakoid) membrane, in which the functional pigments can be re-
garded as optical probes for fast electrical events. In particu -
lar, delayed luminescence (due to the reversal of the Light-
induced charge separation) is very sensitive to electrical
parameters of the membrane and to events within it. It can he
considerably enhancedé by an artificially induced potential, an
externally applied electric field pulse (~ 1000 v/em) being
uniquely suited for achieving this, in a {preilluminated)
suspension of photosynthetic membrane-bounded vesicles.

The magnitude and the kinetics of the resulting emission (electro
photoluminescence - EPL) are strongly dependent on the (very low)
electric conductivity of the membrane. Ionophores selectively
increase this conductivity, to an extent that is determined i.a.
by (a} their nature (carrier or channel) and concentration; (b)
the identity and concentration of the translocated ion. As a
result of ionophore action, EPL emission is diminished and often
kinetically altered.

We investigated this phenomenon under various conditions, and
we present : (1} the theoretical background for the evaluation of
ionophore effects from changes in EPL emission; (2) results on
the gramicidin channel and the valinomycin carrier, regarding
their kinetics and ion selectivity.
