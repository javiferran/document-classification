IIl. RESULTS

lL. The phenomenon of electrophotoluminescence

When, following preillumination, an external electric field
pulse of a few hundred Volts/cm is applied to a suspension of
chloroplasts or blebs, a marked (up to orders of magnitude)
enhancement of the natural emission of delayed luminescence is
observed (Fig. 3 - insert). The phenomenon is known as electro -
photoluminescence (EPL} (8] and has been studied by several
groups [3,5,8,12,27]. The kinetic pattern and range of parameters
for a typical experiment are given in Fig. 3. The minimal
requirements for the occurrence of EPL are : {a) preillumination
(b) functionality of the photosynthetic apparatus (primary
xeactions) (Â¢) topological closure of the pigmented vesicle
membrane (d) an externally applied field intensity in excess of
a certain apparent threshold value E. In most general terms, the
preillumination induces separation of charges in photosystem II,
the recombination of which produces delayed luminescence (DL).
