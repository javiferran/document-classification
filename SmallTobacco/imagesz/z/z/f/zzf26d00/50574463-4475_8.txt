222 IONOPHORES AND ELECTROPHOTOLUMINESCENCE

A more precise expression for Eq: including its time course is
[13] :
3_(R/d)

(2) EB, ft) = 23 wa O,7 A) {1 - exp (-2A,t/3RC,)] E cos @

where cL is the membrane specific capacitance. It can be seen
from the above relations (1-2) that : (aye is up to three orders
of magnitude higher than £, as typically R/d = 1000 for blebs

(b) the high (R/d) ratios make the second term in the denominator
of eq. (2} non negligible for many cases. (c) for relatively high
da / Ln (20.001) any factor that will affect an will strongly
affect E,-These points are illustrated in Fig. 5.

Since EPL is a monotonous function of Ey {roughly exponential
8,12,27'), and ionophores significantly and selectively increase
Ane the resulting changes in EPL are bound to be a sensitive
probe of ionophore action in the system. By variation of, i.a.
the nature and amount of the ions in the suspension, the type
and cancentration of the ionophore as well as of the external
field intensity, and monitoring of the ensuing changes in EPL, a
whole range of ionophore properties can be studied, with ps

time resolution. A typical example is given in Fig. 6., where
emission in presence of the ionophores is governed by the kinetic
relationship between the rise of En (and EPL) and the turnover
time of the ionophore (see below).

3. Control experiments

To establish the validity of our approach, we applied it to
some of the best characterized ionophores, particularly gramicidin
and valinomycin; their functional action was verified by ability
to inhibit photophosphorylation, produce diffusion potential
delayed luminescence (as in [6], accelerate the decay of the
electrochromic carotenoid ‘shift [28], and modify the dark time
dependence of EPL onset lag by collapsing the light-induced
membrane potential [13] . In view of the latter, measurements
were done at long dark times (tg > 300 ms ~ see Fig. 3), when
this potential almost completely decayed.

4. Gramicidin
The addition of gramicidin to the suspension of blebs caused
a sizeable decrease of EPL usually accompanied hy marked kinetic

alteration of the emission pattern (the left side of Fig. 6 isa
typical example).
