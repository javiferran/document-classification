224 IONOPHORES AND ELECTROPHOTOLUMINESCENCE

of gramicidin, the rate limiting step seems to be a diffusion-
controlled one, namely the association~dissociation of the
gramicidin molecules which create the dimeric channel. A more
detailed explanation will be presented elsewhere. The ion
selectivity of the gramicidin channel has heen tested by changing
(at constant osmolarity and pH) the nature of the ion in the
suspension medium. The results are shown in Table 1.

Davefers to the difference between the measured values in the
absence and presence of ionophores, respectively.

It can be concluded that the ion selectivity corresponds to
Eisenman sequence I (Cs> Rb> K > Na>> Li), and is practically
the same as that found for artificial membranes [15,23] . The
quantitative aspects of this selectivity are influenced by the
choice of the experimental conditions (ion concentrations,
external field intensities, dark times).

5. Valinomycin

The carrier type ionophore valinomycin also diminishes EPL,
but to a lesser extent than gramicidin (Fig. 6). The reason is
likely to be a kinetic one, as it is known that the turnover time
for this specific carrier is in the Ws range [2,17] . Therefore,
the ion transfer it mediates cannot compete very efficiently with
the us build-up of the transmembrane potential in blebs. For the
short times following the onset of the external field E, until at
least one turnover of the carrier, the membrane field E,, is as if
the ionophore were absent. Therefore, we propose that the time t,
after which the emission in presence of valinomycin is beginning
to differ from the control EPL is an indicator for at least the

upper limit of the ionophore turnover time. Our values for t,
(5-20 us) agree very well with those obtained in artificial
membrane studies (2,17) .
