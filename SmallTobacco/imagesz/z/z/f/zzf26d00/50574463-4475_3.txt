IONOPHORES AND ELECTROPHOTOLUMINESCENCE 217

II. MATERIALS AND METHODS

Chloroplasts were prepared according to Avron [4] and stored
at low temperatures by a method we developed (9] , with complete
preservation of all relevant photosynthetic activities. Blebs
[7,10] were obtained by hypotonic swelling of these chloroplasts
in low buffer media (Hepes or Tricine, 5 mM, pH = 7.8) (Fig. 1).
Salt concentrations were adjusted by subsequent addition of
chloride salts of either Li, Na, K, Rb, or Cs, to yield final
concentrations between 1 and 20 mM usually (maximal range 0.1-100
mM). Ionophores (Gramicidin D, Valinomycin, Nigericin) were added
from fresh ethanol stocks.

The resulting blebs were characterized structurally and
functionally [6,10,13] . They were active photosynthetically
(electron transport to ferricyanide and fluorescence induction)
and were usually preferred to chloroplasts ~ which gave Similar
results - because of their sphericity, and larger size resulting
in higher induced intramembrane field intensity (see Theory).
Their size and shape homogeneity could be improved [13] , but
this is not essential in qualitative studies.

The apparatus for electrophotoluminescence measurements is
sketched in Fig. 2. More details are given in [10,12,13].
