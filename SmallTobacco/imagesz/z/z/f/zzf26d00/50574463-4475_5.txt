IONOPHORES AND ELECT! ROPHOTOLUMINESCENCE 219

This can be enhanced by additional detrapping brought about by a
transmembrane field E of the right polarity and intensity,
resulting from the application of the external electric field
which is locally enhanced in the membrane. The characteristics of
EPL under different conditions yield valuable information on
photosynthetic systems, including electron transport £8,121
pigment orientation {10,271 , membrane capacitance £13] ,S-states
of the oxygen evolution precursor [5,27] and dielectric breakdown
and recovery [11 and Farkas, D.L., Korenstein, R, Malkin, Ss. - in
preparation] .
