steady-state result is :

(1) En = 1.5 (R/d) E cos @ (with Bye R, d, E and @ defined in
Fig.4).

Eq. (1) is obtained by solving the Laplace equation for the

potential U in the 3 regions (o, m and i), with the appropriate

boundary conditions (as first done by Maxwell [18], and assuming
Re>d and A = A, >> dD (A-the conductivities).
