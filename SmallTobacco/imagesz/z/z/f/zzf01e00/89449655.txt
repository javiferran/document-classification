Le TOBACCO COMPANY

MEMORANDUM

July 16, 1993

TO: Dr. A. W. Spears

SUBJECT: Harley-Davidson Milds/Japan

Subsequent to our discussions of July 14, I have reviewed the
Tobacco Institute of Japan (TIOJ) regulations and our T&N data. The
TIOJ tolerances require that verification values be within + 20% of
the printed values on the package.

We notified PBI in March (copy attached) that our initial values
were l mg "tar" and 0.1 mg nicotine lower than our printed values;
PBI recently advised R. Hammer that TIOJâ€™s data confirmed our
results. The data for our May/June runs (attached) correspond
exactly to our printed values.

Based on the above, no modifications to our existing printed
materials are required.
