- The draw of the Kent 2000 product seems to be
wrong for the RJR smoker, but little Girection was
provided as to how this should be modified.

e Relative to the Kent 2000 product, Marlboro Lts. struck a
better balance on most directionals. There were fewer
notable differences evident between the ratings of PM and
RJR smokers.

e The Kent M2 product, overall, struck a better balance among
PM than RJR smokers. The RJR smoker desired a stronger
taste and an increased level of tobacco flavor relative to
the preferences of the PM user. Harshness though not
mentioned frequently for Kent M2 by RJR smoker was a fairly
common concern among PM smokers.
