e As an additional reference point, Kent M2, an 85MM product,
was included in this analysis. Kent M2 was substantially
more competitive among Lo-Fi and at near parity among LT
smokers when compared to Kent 2000. However, overall Kent
2000 had a slight edge over M2 when the Lt business alone
was considered.

a As a possible diagnostic aid, Kent M2 was evaluated as
being more similar to Marlboro Lts. in total, than wes true
of Kent 2000 in the product directionals. The two
disparate areas were burn time and harshness.

- Among Lo-Fi smokers, M2's strength of taste
appeared to be at a more appropriate level
than that of Marlboro Lts. or Kent 2000.

- However, M2's perceived delivery of tobacco
taste lagged behind Marlboro Lts. but was
superior to Kent 2000.

- Perceived harshness of Kent 2000 and M2 was
notably higher than that of Marlboro Lts.

6 The trends uncovered through the directionals were
manifested, once again, in the consumers use of the
technical word list: ,

~ Marlboro Lts. was characterized as a brand
‘ with a good taste delivery, yet maintaining
its smooth taste. This product was more often
characterized than the other two evaluated as
being:

- Full

. Aromatic
. Tobacco
. Smooth

As you will recall, the above are all words that
are generally associated with a strong performance.

- Kent 2000 was notably less likely to foster these
positive associations when compared to the other
two products tested it was more likely to be
described as:

- Peppery
» Dusty
. Bland

- The Kent M2 product, on the otherhand, was less
frequently noted as being light or smooth, but
was more often characterized as sharp when
compared with either of the other two products.
