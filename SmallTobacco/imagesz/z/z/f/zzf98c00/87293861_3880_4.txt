As a basis of comparison Kent M2 85's performed direc-
tionally better than Kent 2000 in total and among PM
smokers, but significantly outpaced the Kent 2000 product
among RJR smokers. Among Lorillard smokers, however, Kent
M2 demonstrated little appeal, and was significantly
outperformed by both Kent 2000 and Marlboro Lts,

Average Satisfaction Ratings
By Manufacturer

Marlboro Lts. 100's average satisfaction rating was
identical for both Lo-Fi and LT smokers (7.3). However,
Kent 2000 100's performed poorly among Lo-Fi smokers (5.5),
but significantly better among the LT groups, (6.6).

- Marlboro Lts. 100's, however, performed
significantly better than Kent 2000 100's
in both tar categories.

Kent M2's appeal was contrary to that posted by Kent 2000
100's. The Kent M2 product performed significantly better
among Lo-Fi than LT smokers. M2's performance among the
Lo-Fi group was significantly stronger than that posted by
Kent 2000 100's. The flipside, however, is that among LT
smokers Kent 2000's performance was directionally stronger
than that achieved by M2.

Average Satisfaction Rating
by Tar Category

As would be expected, the 100MM products (Marlboro Lts. and
Kent 2000) performed significantly better among 100MM than
85MM smokers. In both cases the point spreaded between the
ratings provided by 85's vs. 100â€™s smokers was about +1
point. Following this relation, M2, an 85MM product,
achieved higher ratings among 85's rather than 100MM
smokers (once again the point spread was close to +1).
