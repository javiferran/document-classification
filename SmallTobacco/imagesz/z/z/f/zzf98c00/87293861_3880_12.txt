Satisfaction: Test vs. Reguiar Brand By Manufacturer

e Both Kent M2 and Marlboro Lts. 100's were significantly
more satisfying to the PM rather than the RJR smoker. Kent
2000 100's achieved comparable satisfaction ratings among
both PM and RJR smokers, though its level of satisfaction
was lower for both sub-groups than that posted by either
of the other two products.

Directional Performance Profiles in Total

e Relative to Marlboro Lts. 100's Kent 2000 1060's should be
made:

- Stronger tasting

- With an increased tobacco taste
- Slower burning

- Easier to draw

e Relative to Kent M2, Kent 2000 had similar deficiencies
with exception of burn rate, which is probably an artifact
of comparing an 85 with a 100MM product.
