Directional Improvement Profiles Among Lo-Fi Smokers

e To suite the Lo-Fi smokers' taste, all three products
required an increase in strength specifically:

 

- Kent 2000 100's required the greatest boost in taste
to satisfy a Lo-Fi smoker and Kent M2 required the
smallest boost.

e Though Kent M2's strength of taste was more in line than
that of the other two products, its need for an increased
tobacco taste was greater than Marlboro Lts. 100's, but
less than Kent 2000 100's.

- As seen earlier for Marlboro 85's the tobacco
characteristic attributed to Marlboro Lts. may be,
in part, a misperception fostered by its artificial
note.
