TO: A. B. Hudson
FROM: E. P. Farrell
RE: KENT 2000 100's (9mg.) (#1464-84) - TEST SUMMARY

Two LT products have recently been put through the Starch
National Smokers Panel, they are:

- Marlboro Lts. 100's
= Kent 2000 100's (9mg.) (#1464-84)}

The Kent 2000 product is different from the 12 mg., PM taste
alike or the 12 mg. sweet product evaluated through consumer
product testing. The Kent 2000 product (#1464-84) is closely
associated with the 12 mg. PM taste alike, however.

As a possible diagnostic aid the Kent M2 product was explored,
once again.

To review all three products were paneled among samples of 246
Lo-Fi/LT smokers. All three samples were balanced to provide
equal representation of the following dimensions:

- Age

- Sex

- Region

- Regular Brand by Packing

CONCLUSIONS

ti The Kent 2000 100MM product (#1464-84) demonstrated notable
deficiencies relative to Marlboro Lts. 100's on most
measures including:

Average satisfaction ratings

Purchase likelihood

Satisfaction relative to current brand
Product directionals

e These lapses in Kent 2000's performance spanned most
relevant user groups: Lo-Fi/LT, 85's/100's and
manufacturers. The one exception was Kent 2000's greater
satisfaction rating among Kent smokers than that achieved
by Marlboro Lt. 100's.
