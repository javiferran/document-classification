IMPLICATIONS

Kent 2000 100's (#1464-84) is not a viable product at this time.
Its lack of appeal among Lo-Fi smokers would seriously curtail
its ability to attract new business. Further, its ineffective-
ness in attracting Lo-Fi candidates was not compensated for by
its performance among LT smokers.

Though Kent 2000 100's tar level (9mg.} was comparable to that
to Marlboro Lts. 100's (l0mg.) there was a marked difference in
taste delivery. At these tar levels it is unlikely that the
difference was tobacco taste, but probably the result of taste
augmentation through some other means.

Several developmental directions suggest themselves for the Kent
2000 product:

- increase in mouth feel

- decrease in harshness

- increase in taste amplitude
- decreased rate of burning

Kent M2 appeared to be more similar in taste to Marlboro Lts.
than Kent 2000 was. The flavoring systems and construction of
the M2 product should be explored for further refinements and a
possible understanding of this product's appeal.
