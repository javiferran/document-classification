Nitrogen Oxides

  

This refers to a mixture of two chemical compounds, one called
nitrogen oxide, (or nitrogen monoxide) and a second compound called
nitrogen dioxide. By convention, that is to say, by a more or less
arbitrary agreement, analytical chemists express this mixture of
nitrogen oxides as nitrogen dioxide valy. However, tobacco smoke
contains either infinitesimal amounts or no nitrogen dioxide; all,
or nearly all of the "nitrogen oxides" in tobacco smoke is nitrogen
oxide,,a gas which is innocuous biologically, even in relatively
large quantities.

The chief reason why nitrogen dioxide is alleged to be dele-
terious is, because it could theoretically combine with some other
tobacco or smoke constituents, which are called amines, and form
conpounds, which are called nitrosamines, which have been shown
in many animals to cause a variety of cancers. The odd thing about
this is that, some years ago, one of the most famous and vehement
tobacco antagonists, Dr. Wynder, has added a compound to tobacco,
called nitrate, which has as a consequence to increase the amount
of nitrogen dioxide in smoke. He has alleged that the smoke from
tobaccos treated with nitrate, i.e., which should increase any
{eld of nitrosamines in the smoke, was less carcinogenic to ani-
mals than th t from regular tobaccos. This means, if anything,
that the minimal lesser amounts of nitrogen dioxide, which may or
may not be present in smoke from regular tobaccos should not have

any carcinogenic effect.
