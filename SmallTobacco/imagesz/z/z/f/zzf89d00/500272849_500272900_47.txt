XV.__ THE END: __\ VITAMIN C 1S DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH,

 

We have now come to the end of the formal presentation, except
I want to come back to a point I raised earlier, to illustrate the
controversial nature of many scientific findings. I have said above

that most regular components of food products, even vitamins, have.

. been alleged to cause cancer or othe’ diseases. Now, the latest

wrinkle in studies on the genesis of cancers is to equate cancer
causing activity with the ability of a chemical compound to cause
an inheritable change, technically called a mutation, in micro-
organisms, such as bacteria, etc. Recently a very well respected
researcher in Canada has shown Vitamin C to cause such mutations,
fi.e., the equivalent of cancer, (82).

Another researcher from the U. S. Department of Agriculture
has claimed, last year, that,in rats, Vitamin C can induce an _
excess of cholesterol. His conclusions were as follows: "... it
seems likely that an excessive intake of Vitamin C increases the
risk of coronary heart disease", (83).

XVI. CONCLUSION

Summing up, I would like to remind you of what I have been
trying to show you: It would be irresponsible to claim that
c.garette smoking can be exonerated of suspicion as a possible
health hazard. However, I hope I have been able to convince you
that there are many contradictions, innumerable doubts and count-
less unanswered questions - and there are many others I did not
even have the chance to touch upon - regarding the efforts to link

smoking to various diseases. THE SMOKING AND HEALTH CONTROVERSY

IS A CONTROVERSY.
