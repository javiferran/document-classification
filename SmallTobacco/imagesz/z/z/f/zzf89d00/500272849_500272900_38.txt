in identical twins. This was found, for example, by Friberg, (63).
Similar results were reported by Lamdman, (64), and by Liljefors,
(65), and by De Faire, (66).

Commenting on all these findings, De Faire stated; "It may
well be that cigarette smoking only reflects a certain constitution
and that smokers and non-smokers are self-selected groups." (66)

Some quite different evidence fcr the inheritance of the desire
to smoke was reported a few months ago under the title: “Relation
of parental history of coronary heart disease to risk factors in
young adults. The Framingham Offspring Study," as follows: "Com-
pared to male offspring of those without CHD, a significantly
higher proportion of male offspring of young CHD victims smoked
cigarettes. This excess occurred independently of the age of the
offspring and despite the offspring‘ s apparent knowledge of his
father's coronary event." (67) ,

In my own judgment at least, the constitutional hypothesis
does not require genetic mechanisms in the strict scientific sense
of that term. It can also involve psychological or psychosomatic
predispositios which are well set in a person's early life, very
much prior to the onset of smoking.

At this point, a cautionary note might be worth making. A
more or less reasonable argument can be put forth against many of
the paradoxes and fallacies, which I have, and will be, citing
against the alleged casual hypotheses. However, in a very impor-
tant respect, it is the multiplicity of these fallacies, which

make the smoking and health controversy a controversy.
