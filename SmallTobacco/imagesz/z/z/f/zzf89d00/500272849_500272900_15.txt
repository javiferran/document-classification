conditions allegedly linked to smoking are themselves proo

absurdity of the many anti-tobacco claims. This is because of some
fairly esoteric, but well established, scientific principles, which
even the 1964 Surgeon General's Report made its own, (8, see also
e.g. 59), and also because - in my judgment - common sense indicates
that if tobacco were really the cause of all these ailments, people
would have long ago stopped smoking. Now, of course, not all the
anti-tobacco scientists claim that all these conditions are ‘caused
by smoking. However, the most important among these diseases include
the diseases alleged to be together responsible for most deaths of
our post-World War II world, at least for the developed - untries,
such as the United States and Europe. These most important groups
of diseases are again listed here: ;
