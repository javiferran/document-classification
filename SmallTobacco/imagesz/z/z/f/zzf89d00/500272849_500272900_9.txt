Education and Welfare, made a gesture and asked the Industry to
present its point of view on the smoking and health controversy
prior. to the publication of the 1968 Supplement. A group of us,
including Mr. Jacob and myself, labored many weeks, including nights,
to put together a comprehensive report. However, all those efforts
were in vain and our report was compietely ignored by the Government.

Another flagrant example of extreme bias was the just mentioned
summary report for 1971, published in 1972, wherein the Government
chose to ignore completely, or almost completely, any reference to
any medical evidence which did not conform to the dogmas of the
anti-tobacco lobby.

In the course of the U. S. Senate Hearings, held in February
1972, (7a), the Chairman asked Dr. Sommers, Chairman of the Advisory
Board to the Council for Tobacco Research, for a list of references
omitted from the U. S. Government reports on smoking and health,
and Dr. Sommers supplied a collection of almost 2,000 references,
which were included in the printed proceedings of these Hearings.
However, the next report was only slightly less flagrantly biased.

I am mentioning this merely as an illustration of the difficulties

_of those who try to present a more objective scientific point of

view. This applies regardless of whether such scientific studies
are or are not suprorted by the tobacco industry. Fortunately -

at least in the U. S. - it is possible, though difficult, to get
studies, which are not biased against smoking, published in the
scholarly medical and scientific literature. However, it is almost

always impossible to get such information into major media outlets,
