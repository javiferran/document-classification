SMOKING AND HEALTH UPDATE

 

HEALTH C - SOME P. AND FALLACIES"
By: Dr. Frank Colby - RJRT

ECTIVE:
What we want to convey can almost be summarized in one sentence:

The smoking and health controversy is just that - it_is a controversy.

SIGNIFICANCE AND GENERAL FORMAT OF THE SESSION ON SMOKING AND HEALTH
The smoking and health controversy is a very important question;

our Industry has been - and is, of course, trying to provide the
answer. If there ever should be any component or components, as
found in smoke, that can be proven to be, or contribute to be, a
cause of any disease in man, we will of course, take them out.

We will have three presentations on the topic of smoking and
health. I will first discuss the scientific and medical aspects of

' the smoking and health controversy; then Dr. Senkus, who for many

years has been Director of Research of this Company, and who has
recently been promoted to Director of Scientific Affairs, will

ex. ,iain how the U. S. tobacco industry, and especially this Company,
have responded technologically and in the marketplace to the effects
of this controversy.

Then M:. Ed Jacob will review some of the worldwide political

and legal aspects of this controversy, but, because of his experi-
ence, he will, of course, discuss mainly the United States.
