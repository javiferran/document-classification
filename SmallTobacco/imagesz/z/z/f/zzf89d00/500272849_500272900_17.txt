only just ed a link - or an association, and by itself can never

 

prove correlation or causation. 2) What is equally necessary is to
uncover the biological pathway or mechanism through which the alleged
cause produces the disease, either in man or in a suitable animal
model. No satisfactory mechanism has been described for any disease
alleged to be associated with smoking. Nobody knows the causes of if. of
cancer or of heart disease, etc. â€˜this is one of the major reasons
why the allegations against smoking are controversial. _ .
Why is it that an epidemiological association does not and

can never prove a cause and effect relationship? It is essentially

because there are at least three alternatives to the allegations
that any activity, such as smoking, is the major cause, or one of
a number of causes of a disease, such as lung cancer: #1: The
association may be purely coincidental. #2: Both the alleged
cause and the disease may be due to @ common factor, e.g., heredity
or psychological profiles, causing both the disease and the smoking.
#3: The disease may be the primary factor and the alleged cause
the secondary factor, i.e., the presence of a certain disease
causes a person to smoke.
In the past, there have been many statistical associations
which were firmly, but falsely, believed by most medical scientists,
at tha. cime, to be causal. For example, it was shown that scurvy
occurred chiefly in people who ate meat salted for the purpose of
preservation. It was, therefore, believed that such salty meat

was the cause of scurvy. Now we know better. We know it was not

the salty meat that these people ate that was the cause of scurvy,
but a lack in their diet of fresh vegetables and fruit and other

sources of vitamin C.
