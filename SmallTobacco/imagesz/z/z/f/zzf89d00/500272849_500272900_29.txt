* However, these decreases were predicted more than 20 years ago,
when these technological and marketing, developments could not be
anticipated. One of these predictions was made by the same Dr.
Gilliam, whom we have just discussed, (28). The same decrease
was predicted by Dr. Lees of Great Britain, based on different
considerations. Dr. Lees has developed the "wave theory of cancer

incidence". His thesis is that the secular trend of each cancer

rises and falls in a predictable wave, the rise and fall affecting

the youngest ages and then working through to the oldest. When the
wave is rising, the numbers at the younger ages predominate and

the average age oat death in a single year is low. As the cancer
wave goes over its peak, the converse become true, (29). We shall
come back to the Lees theory later on when we will discuss “peak
* incidence". 7
X. SOME OTHER PARADOXES ON LUNG CANCER.

There are many other paradoxes which do not jibe with the
simplistic allegation that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.
In the interest of brevity, we can merely enumerate a few of these
paradoxes, without discussing them in any detail.

For example, there is lack of correlation between the inci-
dence of lung cancer in various countries throughout the world
and the per capitu consumption of cigarettes. For example, lung
cancer incidence is highest in England and Scotland, and much
lower in the U. S., but per capita cigarette consumption in the
United States is far higher than in Great Britain. Similar.
discrepancies occur from other countries, such as for example,
Sweden and Norway, Austria, etc. I am citing only one recent

study, and it has been selected because Doll is one of the authors,
