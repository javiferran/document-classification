- that had been proven for the infectious and deficiency
a. However, this is almost surely wrong, because these
chronic ‘diseases have much much more, and currently often inex-
tricably, complex cause and effect relationships. With most
infectious and deficiency diseases there is one,and only one,
causal factor, and the effect, i.e., the disease, always occurs
whenever conditions are favorable, i.e., the patient's defenses
are weak, etc.

Also, the time span between the occurrence of the “cause”
in the patient and the occurrence of the disease is short, a
few days or weeks or months, or at most a handful of years. On
the contrary, the factors involved in the chronic diseases are
multiple. They interact, etc. Many factors are not known. In
addition, they take many years, often decades or more, to mature.
Attempts to determine causes involves the use of very sophisticated
mathematical techniques or aré often impossible with our current
knowledge. The gap in level of necessary sophistication between
determining the etiology of a disease like tuberculosis on the one
hand, and lung cancer on the other hand, is much wider than the
gap in level of sophistication between understanding one of the
principles of Archimedes, i.e., leverage on the one hand, and
Sinstein's atomic physics on the other hand.
