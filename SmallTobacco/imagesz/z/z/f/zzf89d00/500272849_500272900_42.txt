not really exposed to smoke, but were exposed to something identi-

 

cal or very similar to "tar", because of the inevitable heavy

‘the data were published here in 1973 in the Journal of the National |
Cancer Institute (72), nor before, is additional evidence of the |
very limited significance of these experiments. '
However, there are also other experiments which show opposite
results. Recently, one of the most prestigious American scientific
institutes, i.e., the Battelle Institute, has published some data of
experiments, which were not in any way financed by the U. S. Tobacco
Industry, but on the contrary, were paid for by the U. S. Govern- i
nt, (73). These experiments showed that hamsters inhaling |
cigarette snoke lived significantly longer than hamsters which did
not smoke. Futhermore, for sham-smoking hamsters, i.e., hamsters
which were subjected to the same smoking procedures as a smoking
hamster, but without cigarettes, the longevity was intermediate.
Now, in my judgment, these Battelle experiments have, from the
point of view of human smoking, as little - or as much - validity
as the skin painted mice or the smoking beagles. However, there '
is an American expression that says: "what is sauce fcr the goose is :
sause for the gander." Let us adopt for the sake of argument the

shaky logic of the anti-cigarette scientists who claim, on the
