V. WHY IS THE CONTROVERSY "NEWS"?

Now, what are the reasons why the smoking and health contro-
versy has become front-page news only during the last 25-30 years?
I think there are probably many reasons. One is that cigarette
smoking has become a widespread custom in the United States,
Canada, and some European countries only after World War I and in
other countries after World War II or later, i.e., it was not:
“available” as a scapegoat. Another reason is, that since the
end of World War II, medical science has been able to conquer
many of the diseases that were important causes of death until
then, and which were caused by clearly identifiable agents, such
as what is popularly called "a bug", for example the TB bacteria,
etc. This has, of course, had the consequence that other diseases,
wk' oh are cailed chronic diseases, have become the most important
causes of death. It is mainly these chronic diseases, which are
alleged to be linked to smoking. Another reason is the ever-
increasing dominance ead availability of the mass media, such as
newspapers, T.V., etc., and also a more predominant pre-occupation

of the public with matters of health.
