. deaths in worsons 35 years of age and older, that were attributed

to other respiratory diseases, were in fact due to cancer of the
lung, he recorded increase in white males since 1914 would be
fourfold instead of twenty-six fold". Now, there is very little
question that in the past the error in diagnosis was many times

2%. Dr. Gilliam, in his paper, personally,concluded that there

was a real increase in lung cancer, hecause he assumed that the
diagnostic error was not large. He also stated; "... unless it
can be shown that errors in diagnosing lung cancer as other res-
piratory diseases, occurred more frequently in males than in females
and more frequently in the older than in the younger age groups, all
of the recorded increase between 1914 and 1950 cannot be attributed
to faulty certification of deaths". In my judgment - and it is
only a judgment - it is probable that these conditions did prevail,
because lung cancer occurs much more frequently in males than in
females, therefore, in the past. the diagnostic error was proba-

bly greater; also, lung cancer occurs much more frequently in older
people than in younger people, so again, in the past, the diagnos-
tic error could very possibly have been greater.

In conclusion, it is almost certain that the increase in lung
cancer is much less than claimed. There is at least the possibility
that it is _purious altogether.

You probably have l.card or read in the "media" in recent weeks,
that lung cancer is decreasing, at least in men, or that at least
the rate of increase has been decreasing. Now, this has been
attributed by our adversaries to the increasing use of filter tip

cigarettes and other cigarettes with lowered "tar" and nicotine.
