: is also a wide discrepancy regarding the physical
characterpstice of the two populations as, for example, the
following table shows, which describes the heights of these

two populations. Again, it is very difficult to imagine any
two populations thich are more widely different, (21).

+ Figures for the U. S. population were derived from National Center
for Health Statistics.

One of the strongest objections that can be made against all
these statistical studies is, that, even though they deal with
diseases which are known to be associated with many, many factors,
they focus only on one element, namely smoking. Therefore, Dr.
Hammond, in his study, tried to meet this criticism by studying

some other factors.

Let me just show you one Hammond table, which deals with the effect of
the consumption of fried foods, (22). Now, this table really "proves",
that the more fried foods you eat, the longer you live. As you cansee,
