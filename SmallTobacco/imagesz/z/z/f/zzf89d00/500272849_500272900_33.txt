As another example, of many studies that show that smoking does not
cause chronic heart disease, I shall again, more or less at random,
cite the very important study, conducted under the aegis of the
American Heart Association, and directed by A. Keys of the University
of Minnesota, comparing coronary heart disease in seven countries,
involving almost 13,000 men. It showed no relationship between
cigarette smoking and coronary heart disease, (42). Keys concluded
tÂ® .t: "Cigarette smoking cannot be involved as an explanation" and
documented tha. statement by the figure on the next page, which is
reproduced from that study.
Figure 6. Percentage of Men Regularly Smoking at Least 10
Cigarettes Every Day (42)
The lengths of the narrow solid bars are proportional to the age-

standardized CHD incidence rates among men CHD-free at entry.
