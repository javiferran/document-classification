Except for epidemiological statistics, animal studies are
most frequently cited by those who allege that there are cause
and effect relationships between cigarette smoking and lung can-
cer:‘or other diseases.

But, it is a fact that, in spite of hundreds and hundreds
of experiments and millions of dollars of expenditures, nobody
has been able to produce these diseases, in forms analogous to
human diseases, experimentally in animals, using cigarette smoke
in a manner reasonably simulating human smoking, with respect to
quality and quantity. Because of the need for brevity, we can
only discuss, and very cursorily at that, what is called cancero-
genesis, i.e, the production of cancer in animals.

2. skin Painting.

Let us first examine skin painting experiments. In these
experiments, cigarette “tar - about which more later - is
painted onto the shaved skins of mice or other rodents. There
it has been appropriately said that these experiments involve the
application of "the wrong material,in the wrong form, in the wrong
concentration, to the wrong tissue, or the wrong animal."' The
‘wrong material” which is used is "tar" or "smoke condensate",

which is nothang which the smoker smokes, but an artifact, as we

shall describe below when we will be briefly discussing ingredients.

“In the wrong concentration": it has been calculated that the
amounts of tobacco "tar" used correspond to a daily (!) human

consumption of about 50 to 100 thousand cigarettes. The “wrong
