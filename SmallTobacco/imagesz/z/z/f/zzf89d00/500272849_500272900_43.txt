The need for brevity makes it impossible to even discuss
animal experiments related to heart disease, chronic respiratory
disease, etc., except to state that the short-comings and failures
in these areas are even greater than for cancer.

Talking about carcinogenesis. experiments with tobscco smoke,
the Surgeon General's Report states: "... the results of a number
of such assays present a puzzling anomaly", and, a few paragraphs
later the report states: "... assessment of all conceivable syner-
gistic effects presents a gigantic problem for exploration", (74).
These words are still true today.

XIV. SMOKE CONSTITUENTS

 

Before closing, a few words need to be said about smoke
constituents and their alleged involvement in the diseases associated
with smoking.

1. "Tar".

Let us first review what is falsely called "tar" or â€œsmoke
condensate". This is a complete artifact which no smoker smokes.
It is .pplied in animal experiments after it has been collected
in a cold trap by cundensation of cigarette smoke at extremely low
tem,ratures; it is rather obvious that no smoker smokes in that
fashion.

Tables on "tar" and nicotine are published in the U. S. and
in other countries. In these cases, "tar'' means the "total parti-
