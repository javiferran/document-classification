, wave over a period of many years, (35) (36).

Some, but certainly not all, of the statistical studies also
show some anomalies regarding inhalation. For example, the famous
study by Doll showed that smokers who inhaled had lower incidences
than non-inhalers, (37), this was confirmed in a Doll paper pub-
lished as recently as December 25, 1976 (37a). Some similar lack
of correlations were found in at least two other studies, and’
commenting on this, the 1964 Surgeon General's Report stated:

",.. there is no immediate explanation for this apparent discre-
pancy", (38). These brave words were published in January of 1964,
now more than 13 years later we are still waiting for this "immedi-~
ate explanation". -

As mentioned, additional paradoxes could be discussed, but
what we have said will have to suffice. *

XI. SOME LIMITED COMMENTS ON STATISTICAL DATA ON CHRONIC RESPIRATORY
DISEASES AND HEART AND RELATED DISEASES. oa

 

 

 

The arguments against alleged causal relationship between”
cigarette smoking and chronic respiratory diseases are as strong
or weak - whichever one's point of view - as those against lung
cancer.

On the chronic respiratory diseases, I will only, more or less
at random, cite as eryamples, two papers among many studies and argu-
ments which could be discussed. One shows (39), that it is totally
unjustified to claim that emphysema, is a new disease, which concurred
with the advent of cigarette smoking. The same paper also shows that
the alleged increase of emphysema may well be an artifact due to

earlier faulty diagnoses and for other reasons, (39). The second
