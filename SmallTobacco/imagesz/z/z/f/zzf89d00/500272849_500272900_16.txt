these diseases occur in non-smokers and also did occur prior to the
widespread use of cigarette smoking. So, there are no really serious
claims that cigarette smoking is THE, 1.e., only cause for any or
for all these diseases, even though some of the more violent anti-
tobacco advocates seem to claim differently, especially in front of
non-scientific audiences. Therefore, what the controversy or contro-
__versies are all about is as to whether or not cigarette smoking is
‘the major cause or a major cause of all, of some, or must of these
diseases.

The rest of my discussion will deal, of necessity all too
briefly, with some of the aspects of a few of these diseases.
Except that toward the end, again very briefly, I will also discuss
some of the components of cigarette smoke. £
VII. _ASSOCIATION AND CAUSATION IN HUMAN DISEASES - DEFINITIONS,

DIFFICULTIES, AND FALLACIES. °

Now, we will discuss why the allegations that smoking causes
certain diseases are unproven. Therefore, we have to have a clear
notion on what conditions are necessary to establish an unequivocal
cause and effect relationship between a "cause" and its effect, as
manifested by a d’sease. In a very much oversimplified manner,
two conditaons are necessary; and it is absolutely imperative and
axiomatic that BOTH conditions are fulfilled. Or to put it dif-
ferently, one of these conditions is not enough: 1) There must
be an unequivocal evidemiological link, i.e., association, between
the alleged cause and the more or less widespread occurrence of the

disease. However, in and by itself, an epidemiological link is
