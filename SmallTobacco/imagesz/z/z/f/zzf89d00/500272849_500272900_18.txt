A second example - at one eineie was "statistically proven",
that malaria came from the so-called "night air’ of swampy areas.
The very name of the disease shows that: malaria means “mala aria",
two Italian words which mean bad air. Today we unequivocally know
better. We know that malaria is caused by the presence of a para-
site in the red blood cells transmitted to man by mosquitoes.

In general, it can be said thet today the problems of the
cause and effect relationships have been solved for most diseases
similar to malaria, which is just one of the many infectious
diseases, and most diseases, such as scurvy, which is just one of
many nutritional deficiency diseases. Also, most such diseases
are now curable.

Therefore, these conquests of medical science have had the
fortunate effect, especially since the end of World War II, - that
deaths due to such diseases have been radically diminished, ‘both
in absolute numbers, as well as - to an even larger extent = as
percentages of "total mortality", i.e., the sum of all deaths.

This obviously means, just by pure arithmetic, that the percentages
of the total mortality of the incurable chronic diseases have
increased. These percentages are further increased, because people
die older, thanks to the conquest of these infectious and deficiency
di: .ases; most of the chronic disease fatalities and "new cases"
only occur in oluer people. In the Western World at least, most
people die from diseases, many of which are the chronic diseases,
which have been alleged to be associated with smoking.

Many scientists, even medical scientists, have continued to

postulate the same relatively simple rechanisms for these chronic
