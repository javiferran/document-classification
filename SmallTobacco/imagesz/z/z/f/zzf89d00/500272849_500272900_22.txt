* . Im other words, following the shaky iggic of the American Cancer
oe
Society, if you are an American male and want to live longer than
average and still enjoy smoking one pack of cigarettes or more per
day, the thing to do is finagle somehow to get enrolled in one of
the Society's surveys.

3. Weaknesses and Paradoxes of the Hammond Study.

The following figure shows how different the Hammond popula-
tion is as to age composition compared to the U. S. population at
large, which it is supposed to resemble. It is difficult to
imagine wider discrepancies. It is easy to see that there is a
colossal over-representation of men between 45 and about 59; as it
happens this is the age of peak incidence of lung cancer and other
allegedly smoking associated diseases, (20).

Distr: ution by Age. (20)

The age distribution of ACS males in 1960 comes from Hammond.
Comparable figures for a population of U. S. males between the
ages of 35 and 85 were computed from tables given in the 1960

U. S. census report.
