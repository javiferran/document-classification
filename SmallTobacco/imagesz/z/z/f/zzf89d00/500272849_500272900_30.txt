(30). However, many other old and recent references could be
listed. -

Another anomaly: since the smoke travels through the rest
of the respiratory system before reaching the lung, one would
expect, that there should be similar increased incidences in can-
cersof the pharynx, larynx, trachea, etc. However, this is not
the case. One would also expect lung cancer to occur in both
lungs, however, this again is not the case and lung cancer occurs
only in one lung. Cases of lung cancer in both lungs or the
trachea are extremely rare, (31).

One would also expect that the age of peak incidence of

lung cancer would occur earlier in smokers and earliest in the

most heavy smokers. However, this is not the case, and the peak
“age of incidence occurs at the same age, regardless ‘whether we
have lung cancer in smokers or in non-smokers, and is also inde-
“pendent of the amount smoked and the starting age of smoking.

Since, except for the last few years, the amount of cigarette

smoking has increased and the starting age of smoking has decreased,
one would expect that the peak incidence age would decrease, however,

the exact opposite is the case, i.e., the peak age of incidence has

‘increased, i.e., people get lung cancer at an older age than ten

yee'. ago, (32) (33).

This argumei.c regarding peak incidence age is all the more
striking, because in some lung cancers,which have been alleged to
be associated with industrial exposures, this peak age does not
occur at earlier ages; this was shown, among others, by Hueper, (34).

Again, this was also predicted by Lees on the basis of his

cancer wave theory, which states that each cancer rises and falls
