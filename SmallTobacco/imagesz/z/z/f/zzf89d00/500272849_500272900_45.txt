Also, almost all tne Investigations involving low-level effects
of carbon monoxide use continuous administration of sct levels of
carbon monoxide. This is fundamentally different from the smoking
situation which involves intermittent exposure, i.c., exposure to
carbon monoxide interspersed by more frequent and longer lasting
exposure to ambient air.

Furthermore, the levels in smokozs, of even more than a pack
a day, are probably not biologically significant. As an example,

I would like tocite findings on automobile tunael workers which
are exposed to much higher and less interwittent carbon monoxide
levels than smokers; even in these workers no significant long-
term effects of carbon monoxide could be shown, (78)(79). In
another study it was reported that some of the biological effects
of carbon monoxide and other smoke components - possibly nicotine -
counterbalance each other; this work was done by Dr. Aronow of

the University of California, a vehemently anti-tobacco researcher,
(80).

Parenthetically, there are also some data with rats claiming
to show that the carcinogenic activity on mouse skin of a chemical
compound, called benzo(a)pyrene, allegedly the most important
carcinogenic constituent of cigarette smoke, is inhibited by
aicotine, (81).

4.  Hydiogen Cyanide.

Another gaseous component of tobacco, which has been cited in
efforts to incriminate smoking is hydrogen cyanide. Here again,
the amounts in smoke are biologically insignificant. In addition,
a large portion of this does not reach the respiratory system where

it supposedly is doing its damage, but is absorbed in the oral cavity.
