and con must stand or fall on the issue of statistics.

2. General Methodological Wealmesses and Lack of Representa-

tiveness of the Most Important Statistical Studies.
The statistical arguments against smoking are largely based on

7-8 large so-called “prospective” studies, evaluated in the 1964
Surgeon General's Report. The first such study, published by Doll,
dealt with British doctors (10). It is to this date still the
second most important one. Three others involved American (11) (12),
or Canadian (13) veterans, another involved California men (14)
subject to higher than usual alleged occupational risks of developing
lung cancer. All these share a serious shortcoming - the populations
are highly selected and do not represent the population at large.
Other studies were purposely designed - albeit unsuccessfully, as
shown below - to be more representative. These include the two
studies of American men and women, directed under the aegis of the
American Cancer Society - and specifically one of its vice-presidents,
Dr. Cuyler Hammond (15)(16). The second American Cancer Society study
cited is probably the most important of all, because it is a pros-
pective study involving about a million people (16). There is also
a larse sca..e Japanese study, which is difficult to evaluate, because
only very little has been published in scientific journals, in
sufficient detail for it to be properly scrutinized. Most of the
data have only been presented at scientific meetings (e.g. 17).

Since we can only briefly discuss these investigations, we
must confine ourselves to the big Hammond study involving about a

million people, and to the Doll study.
