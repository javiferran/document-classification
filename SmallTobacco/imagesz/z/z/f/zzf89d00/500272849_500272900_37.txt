‘smoking and the low-birth-weight of infants, found that the incidence

of low-birth-weight infants born to future smokers during the period
before they started to smoke is as high as the incidence for infants
of mothers all of whose pregnancies occurred during periods of
smoking. The incidence of low-birth-weight for infants born to
future smokers during periods before they started to smoke was
significantly higher than that of infants of mothers who never
smoked. Striking also was the finding that past smokers during the
period before they quit smoking gave birth to relatively few low-

 

birth-weight infants. The incidence was significantly lower than
for infants whose mothers smoked during all the pregnancies. There-
fore, even while they smoked, women who subsequently quit smoking
differed in their reproductive experience from continuous smokers.

Additional, powerful evidence for the constitutional hypothesis
has come from a whole series of twin studies. Let me recall that ‘
identical twins have originated from one egg cell, i.e., they have —
in all points common genetic make-up; while non-identical twins,

which have originated from two eggs, are genetically just as dissimi-

lar as brothers and sisters in general. For example, several workers

have independently assembled data showing that identical twins more
* equently have the same smoking habits as have non-identical twins,
(e.g. 60, 61, 52, 62a). Some evidence of a genetic basis for the
smoking habit has also come from non-twin studies of some biological
parameters, (e.g. 62b, c, d).

Other studies reported an excess mortality among smoking dis-

cordant non-identical twins. However, no similar excess was found
