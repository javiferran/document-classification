associations show many weaknesses. Nevertheless, these associations
are consistent, and they are reported from most of the populations
studied. They simply cannot be ignored, because there are too many
studies.

When I discussed above why an association between an alleged
cause and a disease does not mean causation, I mentioned the aiter-
native that both the alleged causaticn and the disease may be due
to a common causal factor, possibly psychological or biological,
which would cause both smoking and the disease. This explanation
is what is called the constitutional hypothesis. The constitu-
-tional hypothesis is based, among other reasons and findings, on
a great deal of evidence suggesting that smokers are different in
many important respects from non-smokers. However, a few brief
examples have to suffice.

Smokers generally are more communicative. They are more
creative than non-smokers - more energetic, (44), more volatile;
(45). They drink more black coffee and liquor, (46). They
marry more often, (47). They prefer spicy or salty foods in
preference to blander diets, (48). They participate in more
sports, (49). They change jobs more often, (50), evidencing,
perh-.s, what one researcher has described as the smokers’ search
“for aims and purpuses", (51).

As children, they were more independent, (52). As adults they
are more outgoing, (53). They differ in family background as well.
They are more likely to have parents with heart disease and hyper-
tension, (54).

The constitutional hypothesis suggests, that these differences
