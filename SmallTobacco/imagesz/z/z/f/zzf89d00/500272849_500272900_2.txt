all too often we find that the guideline seems to be: “Never let
the facts interfere with a good story - or with a good headline."
Now, there can be no argument that - in terms of numbers - the
vast majority of medical and other scientists discussing the smoking
and health controversy allege that cigarette smoking is the major
cause, or, at least a major cause, of lung cancer and/or other
diseases. But, if we confine ourselves to those scientists who
are doing actual research, this majority is much less overwhelming.
One aspect which makes a discussion of this controversy 80
very difficult is, that it is fraught with so mich emotionalism.
Many, otherwise sober and logical, physicians and other scientists
seem to lose all sense of measure and perspective when it comes to
talking about smoking and health. Now, this emotionalism is such,
that the enti-cigarette forces often abuse those who try to present
a more objective and more sober point of view, even threatening
them in their livelihood, and particularly accusing them of serving
‘merchants of death" or serving "vested interests." But, here ve
should not forget, that many of the physicians and other scientists
who allege that cigarette smoking is responsible for shortening the
lifespan of smokers, and that it is, mainly or at least in part,
responsit’e for so many medical ailments, equally represent "vested

interests", because tir scientific reputation and their liveli-

However, there seem to be lately some changes in that one-

sidedness, because a few of these scientists no longer concentrate

exclusively on cigarettes, but are devoting their attention to our
