relatively recent years, has the smoking and health controversy come

into major prominence, as exemplified by very frequent front page
or T.V. or radio coverage.

Dr. Senkus will cover some, and Mr. Jacob will cover other
highlights of the history of the concroversy of the last 25 years
or 80.

IV. THE 1964 “SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT", FOLLOW-UP REPORTS AND
THEIR BIASES

However, the most important event in this history was undoubt-
edly the publication in 1964, of what is now generally called the
Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health, (6).

And,. since 1967, the Public Health Service of the U. S. :
Department of Health, Education and Welfare, has been under :
obligation of publishing annual follow-up reports or supplements
to the original Surgeon General's Report and these are entitled:
Health Consequences of Smoking. The most important of these is
the report for 1971, (7), because its purpose was to summarize
everything published up to that time, including the 1964 report.

Now, all these reports by the Surgeon General are rather one-
siued, in that they are very heavily weighted against cigarettes
and tobacco in general, and, more or less, ignore or play down any
contrary evidence, no matter how solid. In my judgment, the
relatively least biased was the first, or 1964, Surgeon General's
Report, at least to those who were able to read and understand the

full text and especially the data in the tables and figures.
