vorried as fine particles in suspension; it is then collected on

a filter as a dense precipitate, or in some countries on an
electrostatic precipitator. Here again no smoker ever experiences
it in that form.

2, Nicotine,

Regarding nicotine, I shall be happy to confine myself to
quote from the Surgeon General's Report: "... the chronic toxi-
city of nicotine in quantities absorbed from smoking and other
methods of tobacco use is very low and probably does not repre-
sent a significant health problem", (75). Nothing has happened
since 1964, which would induce one to alter that evaluation.

For example, in a paper published a few weeks ago, on December
17, 1976, Dr. Gort of the National Cancer Institute has stated:
*... no chronic toxic effects have been clearly and consistently
attributed to nicotine", (76).

3. Carbon Monoxide.

Lately, some of the gaseous components of smoke have been
mentioned in the public media in efforts to incriminate cigarette
smoking. The most important of these is carbon monoxide. It is
unquestionable, that smokers have in their blood, higher concen-
trations of carbon monoxide than non-smokers. Howover, unless a
smoker continues to smoke uninterruptedly during the day and does
not go to bed and continues smoking daring the night, this carbon
monoxide significantly decreases in the blood rather rapidly.

The main defect of the misleading claims on the alleged chronic
effects of carbon monoxide is that they are based on pure specula-
tion, "derived from acute exposure to relatively high concentrations "

(69).
