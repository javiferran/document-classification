system are the greatest cause of mortality, at least in the Western
World. There is a general concensus that these diseases are multi-
factorial, which means that there are a great many factors which
allegedly affect or may affect or are in some way associated with
their occurrence and outcome. The factors are called "risk factors".
Depending on definitions, there are, at least, a dozen such alleged
risk factors, including smoking.

One of the many striking arguvents, which can be made against
the alleged causal association between coronary heart disease and
smoking, has been stated, only about a year ago, by H. I. Russek,
one of the most famous U. S. Cardiologists, (41): "At the present

~ time throughout the world, there is wide acceptance of the view

that high cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and cigarette smoking

are the most important risk factors in the etiology of coronary
heart disease. Largely unquestioned, however, has been the repeated
finding that these factors are completely absent in more than half
of all the new cases of coronary heart disease encountered in
clinical practice." Quoting further from that same very recent
scudy: "For example, although more than 100,000 American physicians
have allegedly given up smoking and no segment of our society is
more aware of the potential dangers of hypercholesterolemia and
hypertension than are members of the medical profession, there has j
been no significant change either in longevity or in average age

at death from coronary heart disease among doctors in the United

States over the past 20 years (Table I)." The table on the fol-
