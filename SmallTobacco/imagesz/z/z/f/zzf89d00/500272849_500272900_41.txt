Also, som2 very eminent pathologists have ‘strongly questioned
whether the lesions produced {in the lungs of these dogs were really
comparable to human lung cancer as claimed.

There was further very justified ariticism that the control i
animals used in these experiments were inadequate. For example,
there were no sham-smoking dogs, i.e., there were no dogs subjected
to the same treatment as smoking dogs, but without exposure to tO .
cigarette smoke.

There was also an unusually high incidence of tumors, though
not of tumors claimed to resemble human lung cancers, in all of those
dogs, including 25% of the dogs not exposed to smoke at all.

Also, shortly after the original results were announced, the
Tovacco Institute,in this country, asked the data to be submitted
for an impartial review by a panel of independent scientists.
However, the American Cancer Society steadfastly refused, and
stated that they would submit the data neither to a committee
‘chosen by the Tobacco Institute nor to any other groups, (70) (71).

Also, at the time of publication the authors promised that
further data on lung-cancers in the surviving beagles would be
forthcoming, but to date, almost seven years after the initial
announcement, these have not been published - at least not to my
knowledge.
4. Lifespan Extending Effect of Cigarette Smoking on Hamsters.
Scientists from - of all places - the Research Institute of
the German Cigarette Industry have claimed to have produced cancers |
in the larynx - but not the lungs - of hamsters inhaling cigarette
smoke. Although they started with about 4,090 animals, they pro-
- duced only a handful of hamsters with changes in the larynx, which

they claimed to be cancerous, (72); however, other scientists
