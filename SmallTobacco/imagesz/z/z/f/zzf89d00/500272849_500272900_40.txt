tissue", because the "tar" is applied not onto the respiratory

tissue, but to the skin of mice and other rodents.

3. The smoking Beagles.

However, the most notorious work is that of the so-called
smoking beagles. This is now largely discredited and only rarely
cited, even by its authors, Auerbach, Hammond and others, and
their sponsors, the American Cancer Society. It would have been
very easy to devote all or at least half of my "allotment" to
the critique of the Auerbach study, but a few highlights will
have to suffice.

The data were first not announced in the customary manner,
which is in a scientific journal or in a scientific meeting where
such findings are submitted by the authors to the scrutiny of
their scientific peers. But they were announced in a press con-
ference and in a news release in February, 1970, (68)...

Subsequently, the manuscript was submitted to two prestigious
medical journals but both refused to publish it. The second journal
had gone to great lengths and had asked 18 expert reviewers for
their opinion and 17 recommended against publishing it. Finally,
almost a year after the initial news release, a greatly changed manu-
script was accepted within a few days, in a journal where, inter-
er‘.angly enough, one of the authors of the study served on the
editorial board, (69).

The beagles did not smoke through their oral cavity, but the
cigarette was inserted,through a surgical operation,directly below
the head into the trachea. In other words, the upper respiratory
system, where a substantial part of the smoke is absorbed in man,

was by-passed by those dogs.
