me. For some time, the Research Department has been concerned that the G &R

_ Data is not an effective tool for improving Lorillard's advertising. There
‘appear to be 2 reasons for this problem: - 1) the data does not have the con-

sistency necessary for clear direction, and 2) . the data is just not being used.

Accordingly, we are recommending the discontinuance of the G & R service
as of September 1. We will be investigating alternative methods of measuring
the effectiveness of our advertising during the coming months. Due to the
terms of our contract with G & R, their service will ‘continue through the end

of the year.

If you feel that we should continue to subscribe to the G & R service,’
please let me know before the end of August.

L.D.
