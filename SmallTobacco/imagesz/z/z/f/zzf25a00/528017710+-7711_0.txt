jan:

i plan to raise with andy next week whether we can have some different brands and
different represenations of brands (ie, Red Kamel). I will let you know if I am successful.
So you know, I want to encourage him to have Winston as one of the brands as well.

FYI...

As you will recall, the annual report will feature two large pack photos
for the U.S. company, and two for the international company (in each
case, one "core brand" and onc "new and innovative" brand). RIRT
has selected Camel Lights and Red Kamel; RJRI has selected Camel
Lights (blue pack) and Salem Pianissimo.

The RJRN staff just wants us be aware that this means 3 out of the 4
large shots are Camels of some sort -- in case this bothers anybody.
