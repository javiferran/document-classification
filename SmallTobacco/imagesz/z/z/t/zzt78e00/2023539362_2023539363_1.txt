COMPLEMENTARY STUDY ON HYDROXYPROLINE
Ref. TFA/August 14, 1984

 

During the course of the nicotine metabolism study in Munich
it is intended to determine the concentrations of hydroxy-
proline and creatinine in the 24-hour urine of 20 volunteers.
It is expected that these measurements will provide informa-
tion on the intraindividual variation and the circadian
rhythm of the two substances. DM 6'500.- are necessary for
the chemicals required and: for the volunteersâ€˜ fees.

After a brief discussion, the TFA recommended that the
investigation be carried out (Encl. 2). ~

COUMARIN
Ref. TFA/January 12, 1984

The final meeting on the project took place in Hamburg on
August 31, 1984. The record of results was distributed
(Encl. 3). The most important results of the follow-up
experiment are that there is a high incidence of
cholangiofibroses in the highest dose group (5'400 ppm of
Coumarin). In addition, liver lesions are observed even in
the early phase. Moreover, isolated hepatocellular
carcinomas occur in the highest dose group. The BGA now has
to comment on the results. In the opinion of Prof. Adlkofer,
the chances of approval of coumarin are 50:50. The VDC board
will be informed of the situation after the BGA has
commented.

The association has. received a request for financial support
from the Foodstuffs Chemistry and Forensic Chemistry
specialist group of the GDCh (Encl. 4). Prof. Adlkofer
requested the companies. to comment by the next meeting of
