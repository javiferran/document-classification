formation of 32. The bromo ketone 2a was also epimerized om °

back to fa, resulting in the same equilibrium. Its rate,
however, was distinctly slower then that of the reverse. On
the other hand, Fishman" reported a distinct preference
for removal of the 16a-proton in the enolization of 17-ox0
steroids which was explained in terms of steric hindrance
by the C-18 methyl group to the development of an in-
tramolecular transition complex for the removal of the I6a
proton. The IR spectra in solution of la and 2a showed
the same shift, +16 cm! (1748 cm"), of the carbonyl
group's frequency caused by the introduction of 1Ga- or
16-bromine. Considering the same shift, which indicates
the same projected angle viewed along the C—C bond of
BrC—C—O," together with the stereoslectronic effects,
firat invoked by Corey" in the enolization of a confor-
mationally rigid carbonyl function, it is suggested that the
obzerved difference in the epimerization rate between ta
and 2a should be due to the conformational difference of
ring D between them."

When deuterium oxide was used in the reaction mixture
(99.5 atom % of theoretical D content), the deuterium
labeling at C-16 of both la and 2a was observed in the
reoov. red compounds undy. conditions A and F (Table IID.
The observed differences in the degree of labeling, 76%
for ta and 35% for 2a, were es expected from the differ-
ence of the epimerization rate between la and Za (Table
I). The reaults show that the equilibration between la
and 2a precedes the formation of $a. Observation over the
course of time of the fa, 2a, and Sa concentrations during
the reaction indicates that the conversion of 2a to $a is
the rate-limiting step.

The conversion of the 166-bromo ketone 2a to the
16a-hydroxy 17-ketone 8a could go through the epoxide
intermediate formed by hydroxide attack at the 1'78-pos-

ition (mechanism A, Scheme I), as previously postulated®
for nucleophilic reactions, or proceed by the direct Sy2
displacement of the 186-bromine with hydroxide ion
(mechanism B, Scheme II). We then attempted to de-
termine the mechaniam by use of ['*0]-water with the
Premise that the primary product should be 17-0 labeled
under mechaniam A and 16a-'90 labeled under mechanism
B. In addition, we aimed to confirm or refute the mech-
anism of ketal rearrangement™ which had been formulated
to involve the direct enolization of the,17-carbony] group,
but the alternate mechanism of hydration to the carbony!
followed by dehydration to form the enedio! had been
overlooked. "O-enriched water (99 atom %) was used with
pyridine under condition E (Table II) for the controlled
hydrolysis (la to 8a). ‘The product, Sa, and the recovered
bromo ketones, la and 2a, were acetylated with Ac,O-
pyridine and then purified by TLC. The '®0 content of
the isolated acetates was analyzed with solid samples by
mass spectroscopy. The results are shown in Table III.
Although the molecular ion was insignificant in all of the
analyzed steroids, as is common in such steroidal acetates,
etrong fragment ions representing (M - acetic acid)’ {base
peak for 3a-Ac; and 4-Ac, at m/e $28 and 50% of base
peak (m/e 43) for la-Ac and 2a-Ac at m/e 348 and 350)
and !M - discetic acid] ~ (18-22% of base peak for Sa-Ac,
and 4-Ac, at m/e 268) were observed. Unexpectedly, the
mass spectre of the diacetate derivative of $a obtained
from the bromo ketone 1a showed over 80% '®O labeling
at each of the 16a- and 17-positions.

Although the initial premise we made to directly de-
termine the reaction mechanism was thus found to be
invelid, careful analysis of the mass spectral data revealed
not only evidence to determine the reaction mechanism
but also new information about hydration of a-substituted
