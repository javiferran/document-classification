ketones. The equal content of '*0 found in [M - acetic
acid]* and (M — discetic acid]* fragments gave the as-
signment of the [M - acetic acid]* quantitatively to be [M
~ 36-acetie acid]*. ‘The percent of '°O labeling at the
16a-hydroxyl group in 3a diacetate was then calculated
from the data in Table III by the following equations:

[16-"0, 17-60} + [16-'60, 17-'°0](0.5%, m/e 328) =
(17-60](17%, m/e 268) (1)

(16-"°0] =
(16-180, 17-!Q] + [16-"*O, 17-!90)(81.5%, m/e 332)
(2)

The analyais gave 83% '°0 labeling at the 17-carbanyl and
98% “O labeling at the 16a-hydrozyl group. Ketol 3a
treated under the same condition used for la showed no
labeling at the 16a-hydroxyl group and 78-80% 80 la-
beling at the 17-carbonyl group, showing the extent of
oxygen equilibrium of the 16a-hydroxy 17-ketone (Table
TI). In contrast, the recovered bromo ketone after the
same §-h treatment showed only 17% "0 incorporation
into the 17-carbonyl group, showing that the exchange rate
for the a-bromo ketone is much slower than that for the
a-hydrozy ketone. The 178-hydrozy 16-ketone 4 obtained
by ketol rearrangement of 3a in CH,OH-NeOH-H,°0
showed 74% '80 labeling at the 16-carbonyl and 91%
incorporation into the 176-hydroxyl group.

The reaults demonstrate that the formation of 16a-
hydroxy 17-ketone by alkaline hydrolysis of 16a- and
168-bromo ketones is by the direct Sy2 displacement of
the 16¢-bromine (mechanizm B, Scheme I) and not by the
putative epoxide mechanism (mechanism A, Scheme ID.
Once the 16a-hydroxy 17-ketone is formed by the dis-
placement the 17-ketone ia hydrated easily even under
controlled conditions (mechanism B, Scheme II). Under
the drastic keto! rearrangement conditions (Scheme II),
the hydrate 11, which should initially place the '*0 label
at C-17, may be dehydrated to [.7-'°O]-enediol 12 or, al-
tematively, may be equilibrated back to [17-"0]-17-ketone
Sa. The labeled 3a could be enolyzed to 13 and give rise
to [17-"80}-enedia! 12. The '®O labeling at the 17-position
ia definitive and extensive and therefore shows that the
enediol mechanism previously formulated? is in error. The
first etep must be the 17-hydration and not the enolizction.

(18) The details for the assignment of the [M - AcOH]* peak to be
quantitatively [M - 38-AcOH]* and for quantitative analyais of the "O
labeling at the 1G6e-hydrozyl group were discussed in the preliminary
paper.

Although the possibility of the enolization of 17-labeled
3a to give intermediate 13 cannot be eliminated on the
basis of currently available evidence, there is no reason to
balieve that the rate of enolization of the nonlabeled 3a
should be elower than that of the labeled 3a. If the ketol
rearrangment involves the enol 13 as an obligatory inter-
mediate, the #0 content at the 17-hydroryl group of 13,
then, is expected to be lower than that of f1. The observed
labelings of 91% at the 176-hydroxyl and of 74% at the
carbonyl, which is the extent of the equilibrium after the
ketol rearrangement, strongly favors the hydration-de-
hydration mechaniam (Scheme III, 3a 11 — 12). In this
mechaniam, the 17-hydration is the first step, with the
degree of *O labeling equa! to the initial 18Q content of
the medium, and gives the intermediate triof 11, and this
is followed by the 1,2-dehydration to preferentially remove
nonlabeled water from 16- and 17-positions, presumably
the 176-hydroxide addition'® and the 17a-hydrozyl and
166-proton elimination in the trans quasi-diaxial confor-
mation, to give the 16-ene-16,17-diol 12. Ketonization of
12 then gives highly 176-lebeled, thermodynamically stable
ketol 4. The !8O labeling at the 16-position of 4 under the
drastic conditions should be equal to the '*O content of
the diluted medium after the ketol rearrangement which
was analyzed to be 74%. If the initial 18D labeling at the
17-carbony! is very fast and the enolization to form 13 is
slow and obligatory, the '°O labeling at the 17- and 16-
positions should have been equal. The large discrepancy
of the two labelings disputes the enolization mechanism,
and we postulate the hydration-1 ,2-dehydration mecha-
nism for the ketol rearrangement. ‘The formation of the
16@-hydroxy compound should be a positive indication of
the enolization mechenism involving the intermediate 13.
The fact that it was not detected at. ail during the rear-
rangement further supports the hydration-dehydration
mechanism.

due to the enolization-ketonization reaction of the starting
material before the hromination and not to the enolization
