of 1b-d produced because 2b is not detected under the
reaction conditions. Treatment of Ib-d with 0.12 and 0.30
equiv of NaOH in aqueous pyridine gave rise to an isotope
effect on the C-H(D) breaking process in the enolization
of the 17-carbonyl function (Table IV), even though the
deuterium labeling of 1b-d was only 62%. The observed
production ratios of the 16a-hydroxy derivative 3b would
primarily be due to the isotope effect in the enolization
process, because the epimerization of the bromo ketone

1b to 2b precedes the hydrolysis under the controlled
conditions. The results also demonstrate that the C-H(D)
breaking process should be the rate-limiting step in the
equilibration between the 16-bromo ketones, similar to
substitution reactions of enolizable ketones."

Reaction of the Bromo Ketones | and 2 with Mor-
pholine. The discrepancy between the 166 assignment
for substitution by other nucleophiles*® and the 16a con-
figuration for hydroxide substitution presented here should
be noted. The configuration of the 16f-morpholino 17-
ketone 8 wes first assigned by molecular rotational evi-
dence ® Recently its total structure was unambiguously
determined by X-ray crystallography.” Conformational
analysis of the solid-state structure shows that the 168-
morpholino derivative 8a has a thermodynamically stable
conformation. It hee an unstrained D-ring conformation,
the 14a-envelope form, and an unstrained morpholino
substituent at C-16 in a chair conformation. Nonbonded
interaction between the C-18 angular methyl and the
168-morpholino group could not be detected in 8a.

When the bromo ketones la and 2a were separately
subjected to the reaction with morpholine at room tem:
perature for 30 min, the recovered bromo ketones (yield
83%) were shown by NMR analysis to give the same
equilibrium between la and 2a as observed under the
controlled conditions. On the other hand, the product
obtained upon heating either the 16a isomer la or the 16¢
isomer 2a with the base was seemingly only the 168-
morpholino isomer es previously reported. Treatment of
the 168-morpholino derivative 8b with morpholine-D,0
(2:1 v/v) under the drastic conditions gave in an almost
quantitative yield monodeuterated 8b (Scheme IV). The
signal at 6 2.98 (t, 1 H) of the 16-proton of 8b-d by NWR
and M + 1 (m/e $84) and M + 2 (m/e 385) fragments of
8b-d by mass spectrometry”! demonstrated that the deu-
terium was incorporated regiospecifically at the 16a-pos-
ition of 8b with an 82 atom % abundance.

These results suggest that the thermodynamic control
of the substitution reaction strongly prefers the formation
of the 168-isomer through enolization and that the dis-

placement by morpholine of the 16-bromo 17-ketone occurs
initially to form 16a-morpholino 17-ketone 15. by the S,2
substitution on the 164-bromo isomer 2b as elucidated
unambiguously for the controlled hydroxide reaction, and
then the 16a-morpholino isomer 15 epimerizes to the
thermodynamically stable 16f-isomer 8b in the presence
of heated basic merpholine (Scheme IV).

Experimental Section

General Methods. Melting points were measured on a
Fisher-Jones melting point apparatus and were uncorrectad. IR
spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 267 spectrophotemeter
in KBr pellets. "H NMR spectra were obtained with a Variun
EM.-360 spectrometer and a JEOL JNM-PMX 60 spectrometer
at 60 MHz with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. Mass
spectra were measured on a Hitachi RMU-7 spectrometer.
