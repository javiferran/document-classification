reaction time (12 h of heating under reflux), compared to
the reported one with 2 molar equiv of CuBr,.” We ini-
tially explored the reaction of la with alkali hydroxide in
various polar solvents in order to clarify whether 16a-
hydroxy 17-ketone 3a could be isclated in a high yield
without ketol rearrangement of 3a which leads to forma-
tion of 176-hydroxy 16-ketone 4. The 'H NMR spectra
of the bromo ketones 1a and 2a and the ketols 3a and 4
proved useful for the quantitative analysis of the reaction
mixtures without isolation. The signals at 6 0.90 (s, 3 H)
and 4.57 (m, 1 H) for ta, 6 1.09 (6, 3 H) and 4.14 (t, 1 H)
for 2a, 5 0.96 (8, 3 H) and 4.37 (t, 1 H) for Sa, and 6 0.78
(a, 3 H) and 3.75 (m, 1 H) for 4 correspond to the H at the
C-18 angular methyl and the H at C-16 or C-17, reapec-
tively. A brief treatment of la with 1.2 equiv of NaOH
in aqueous dioxane, EtOH, or MeOH at room temperature
caused epimerization of la to its 168-bromo isomer Za
together with the fonuation of the ketol 3a (Table. The
176-hydroxy 16-ketone 4, the rearranged product, however,
was formed increasingly in proportion to the reaction time,
maintaining the remaining bromo ketones in the same
equilibrium (approximately a 1:1.2 ratio of la to 2a). In
contrast, when aqueous pyridine or DMF was used as a
solvent, the bromo ketone la was converted almost com-
pletely to keto! 3 without the formation of ketol 4 (Table
1). In view of the well-established relative stability of the
16,17-ketols toward alkali hydroxide, these surprising re-
sults, the controlled, quantitative, and stereospecific al-
kaline hydrolysis of bromo ketone la, can be attributed
to the buffer action of the protic solvents. The rearranged
ketol 4 could not be detected in the reaction mixtures with
DMF, even if a longer reaction time (2 h) was chosen, but
approximately 5% of 4 was produced by exposure of 3a
to the NaOH~-pyridine system for 12h. Finally, ke’ol 3a
was obtained in above 95% yield on isolation from la by
use of 75% DMF and a 3(-min reaction time or by use of
75% pyridine and an 8-h reaction time.

This aynthesis has a great edvantage in its simplicity and
high yield over the previously reported and widely used
method™ which involves epoxidation of ring-D enol ace-
tates. This also promises a new utilization of the reaction

° The bromo ketones 1a and 2s were treated in 75%
pyridine at room temperature under the conditions des-
cribed. ° The relative amounts of products were ob-
tained by 'H NMR. © Deuterium content of the steroids
at C-16 obtained by use of D,O (99.5 atom % of theoreti-
cal D content) in the reaction mixture is shown in
Parentheses and was obtained by measuring the peak area
of the C-16 proten in the 'H NMR after purification by
TLC of the product.

for practical syntheses of other steroidal a-ketols which
are important to steroid chemistry. By use of the discovery
of the controlled conditions of hydrolysis in aqueous DMF,
the other 16a-hydroxy 17-ketones 3b and 5b were quan-
titatively obtained from the corresponding bromo ketones,
Ib and Sa,"° under the same conditions. For the quanti-
tative synthesis of estrogen ketol 6b from 6a,"! 2.0 equiv
of NaOH and 1 h of reaction time were required because
of the participation of the phenolic hydroxyl group of
estrogen in an acid-base reaction with NaOH.

Furthermore, using pyridine as a solvent, we could
synthesize sodium 38,16a-dihydroxy-17-oxo-5-androsten-
3-yl sulfate (7), the major human fetal 19-carbon steroid
found in the umbilical cord blood and hitherto unavailable
in crystalline salt form, in one step in 85% yield from
bromo ketone 1a. The bromo ketone 1a was first sulfated
with pyridine-CISO,H complex in pyridine under ice
cooling and then hydrolyzed with a chilled 0.1 N NaQH
solution at 0°C for3 bh. After Amberlite XAD-2 column
chromatography of the reaction mixture, recrystallization
of the crude product from MeOH-Et,0 gave pure sulfate
7. The sulfate 7 was identified by solvolysis back to the
aglycon 3a, by 'H NMR and IR epectra, and by elemental
analysis. This synthesis using pyridine will be applicable
to the synthesis of other steroidal sulfates having the a-
ketol structure.

Mechaniem of the Controlled Alkaline Hydrolysis.
Aqueous pyridine waa chosen as a solvent for the eluci-
dation of the reaction mechanism because the rates of
epimerization and hydrolysis in the solvent are easily
controlled. The dynamic aspects of the equilibrium be-
tween bromo ketones Iq and 2a and of the production of
the ketol $a are shown in Table II. Although epimeri-
zation of 16a-bromo-17-oro steroids to the 168 isomer in
an alkaline” and in an acid medium"’ was previously re-
ported, a detailed examination has not been curried out.
Treatment of la with 0.06 equiv of NaOH gave an ap-
