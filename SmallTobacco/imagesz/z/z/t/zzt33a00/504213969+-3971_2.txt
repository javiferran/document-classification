New Generation Maker Study

A study will begin in early November to evaluate four new generation units
for possible use for cigarette production at Tobaccoville and at 601 after
remodeling. Different brand styles will be produced over time at various
production rates. The expected workload for menthol analyses will be 28
samples per day for 3.5 weeks in December and January. This represents
one sample per hour per maker, one shift only, or 476 samples.

Evaluation Of New Hauni Casing Application System

A study of casing application systems was conducted at 63-1 to determine
the optimum system for installation in new facilities. The two variables
studied were the new Hauni casing drum with an eight-nozzle header system
vs. the company standard three-nozzle system. The Hauni system has the
nozzles spaced throughout the drum while the RJR system has nozzles only
at the inlet of the drum. The data showed no significant difference in
the level or variation of casing on the tobacco, but the header system has
several operational shortcomings. Therefore, the header system offers no
advantage over the standard system. The new Hauni drum, however, is
larger and has a a higher throughput capacity. A follow-up test to
evaluate the delamination systems is pianned but not scheduled.

Personnel Training

All members of this unit (10) attended an in-house GC training course. A
one-day basic course was attended by three members, five attended a
two-day troubleshooting course, and two attended both. All were
complimentary of the training and made favorable remarks about the
instructor and course content.
