measure on the ballot this November.

We appreciate your assistance in obtaining contributions from
within your industry. Needless to say, those contributions -- i
financial and otherwise -- have allowed I-602 supporters to run a .
professional campaign.

This next 30 days will be interesting as we battle the big
government spenders and the liberal media.

Throughout this battle and in future skirmishes, we will fondly
recall your personal efforts and the contributions of those in the
tobacco industry.

Sincerely,

om MChe ——
