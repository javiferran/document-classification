This is to provide you with information concerning the
addition of Iowa and Nebraska to the test areas for the
new Kent products.

Coordination for manufacturing of product, shipping of
product and reducing inventories in the warehouses
should be coordinated at Greensboro. Since there is
no specific deadline, this coordination can best be
done at Greensboro.

Code date on the carton should be "C" and the cases
should be marked with a large red "A" (same designation

as used in original test areas).

We would like to know from Greensboro the timing you
anticipate for:

1. Making product
2. Shipping to warehouses
3. Inventory at warehouses

4. Anticipated date of release to
jobbers/retail outlets.

We would like to have this information so we can inform
sales force personnel in these markets for rotation of
stock.
