The main objective of sending out this Reactivation mailing is to determine whether the
member is a motorsports enthusiast or not, as well as what the member would like to
see in future mailings. Once the brand receives the responses back from this mailing,
their next step will be to divide the club Into two groups: Motorsports Fans and Non-
Motorsports fans. :

Project Details
Let’s try this one more time..hopefully the last.
|. Member Elimination

We identified a group that we called the Drop Group (Group #7). We flagged this
group as cell 7. From this group, you will need to do the following:

1.) Pull UB Flavor =1
Pull UB Segment= FS, CS

2.) Change the status of these smokers from “A” in WWC to “I” WWC status. These
smokers will no longer be members of the WWC.

3.) These smokers should be removed from cell 7 - they will not be mailed the
Reactivation piece.

IL_Sending Members to SEP

We also identified a group that we called the SEP Group (Group #5). We flagged this:

group as cell 5. From this group you will need to do the following:

1.) Pull LST_RESP < 9401

2.) Chango status of these identified smokers to be available for solicitation in SEP 4-
(ls this “R"?) and change their WWC status from “A” to “I”. These smokers will no
longer be members of the WWC and will be sent to the SEP.4 conversion program.
Conv.ste., Event (BRC), PIT profile (now)

NOTE: If some of these smokers reside in Oklahoma, thelr status should be changed
so they are available for solicitation to EW SEP4 and change their WWC status from
“A” to “i", - These smokers will no longer be members of the WWC and will be sent
to the EW SEP 4 conversion program.

3.) These smokers should bea removed from cell 5 - they will not be mailed the
Reactivation piece.

i, New Member Eliminati

We also need to eliminate the new WWC members from the Reactivation mailfila but
not from the WWC.
