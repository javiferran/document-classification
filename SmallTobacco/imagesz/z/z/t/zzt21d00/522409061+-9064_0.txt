Title : WWC Reactivation Mailing Revision

Project Objectives
Reference Alert 0074-C.

In Alert 0074-C we identified two mailfiles...one for the Reactivation mailing and one

for the Screener mailing. These two malifiles were <identified based on the .

segmentation data collected from Alerts 0074-A and 0074-B.

Due to a change in WWC strategy, the brand wants to redo these two mailings. These
two pieces were never produced and thus the two mailings never. went out. Please
make sure MFID tables reflect these changes. —

This change in strategy has resulted in mailing out the Reactiviation piece to all WWC
members, with a few exceptions as detailed below. The Screener plece will not be
used at all.

After making the changes noted below, you will need to maintain the original cell
numbers identified in Alert 0074-C and create one new mailfile.
