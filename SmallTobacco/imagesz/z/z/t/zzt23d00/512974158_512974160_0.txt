NICOTINE PREDICTION MODEL

A statistical computer model would show how much Nicotine will be in
our cigarettes after 2 years aging based on Nicotine In the tobacco
crop, our purchase pattern, the effects of aging, cigarette design
parameters (paper porésity, filter density, etc.), tobacco processing’
(¥ G7, % GI3, Ammonitation, de-nic, etc.), and blending (% grades, belts,

tobacco types, etc.).

We are now printing on some of our packages the amount of Nicotine fn
the cigarettes contained, Thus [t becomes necessary to manufacture
cigarettes to a Nicotine specification. This has resulted ina
substantial reject problem in manufacturing. For example, a large
number of NOW cigarettes have been recalled from the fleld due to

excessive Nicotine.

The amount of Nicotine In the smoke of a cigarette depends on many

things:

Nicotine in the Tobacco crop
X-Grades
Str-Grades
Off shore

Purchase Pattern
% X-Grades
% Straight Grades
% Off Shore

Effects of Aging
Nicotine Loss due to Sweats
