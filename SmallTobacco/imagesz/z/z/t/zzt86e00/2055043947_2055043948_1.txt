Immerse all reagent lines back into their ‘containers with the exception of
the sodium salicylate reagent line. This line will be imersed into it's
container five (5) minutes after the other reagents have flushed through
the channel.

Once the channel has stabilized, it should be standardized using the 160
ppm NH, standard.

NOTE:

Take all reagent lines out of their containers and immerse in a 10% solution
of Hydrochloric Acid (HC1). Allow both channels to flush for five (5)
minutes.

Replace the 10% HC1 solution with a Sodium Hypochlorite Solution. Allow
channels to flush for five (5) minutes.

Replace the Sodium Hypochlorite Solution with deionized water and flush
channels for five (5) minutes.

Shut channels down.

Remove end blocks with pump tubing.

Remove side rails. Check for wear and lubricate.

Place end blocks with pump tubing back on proportioning pump.
Replace old pump tubing with new.

Replace dialysis membrane.

Immerse all reagent lines in freshly made diluent water.

Place pressure plate on proportioning pump. Turn pump and colorimeter
switches on. Allow channels to flush for five (5) minutes.

Immerse all reagent lines into their containers and allow to run until
channels have stabilized.

Standardize channels using the 6 ppm KS and 30 ppm NO,-N standards.

The AA II maintenance procedure should be performed after every seven
(7) days of operation.

PROCEDURE TO BE PERFORMED ANNUALLY

The AA II should be completely overhauled once a year. The following parts
