DIFFERENTIATION OF HL 60 CELLS BY 1,25(OH):D3 289

the presence of the inducer must be main-
iained in the culture medium for a very long
period.

For these reasons we have optimized the
conditions for exposure of HL 60 cells to
1,25(0H))D3 which permit more rapid dif-
ferentialtion of a significant proportion of
these cells with clearly definable initiation of
phenotypic differentiation. We have utilized
this system to demonstrate that the induction
of differentiation of HL 60 cells by a short
exposure to 1,25(OH):D3 is preceded by a
rapid but transient inhibition of the expres-
sion of c-myc oncogene, and by a transient
inhibition of cell replication. These findings
are consistent with a role for c-myc oncogene
expression in the uncontrolled growth of HL
60 cells.

Materials and Methods. Cell culture. The
HL 60 cells generously provided by Dr.
Giovanni Rovera of the Wistar Institute,
Philadelphia were subloned and continuously
propagated in this laboratory for 12 months.
The cells were incubated at 37°C in 25-cm?
Falcon flasks using McCoys SA modified
medium (Flow Laboratories) supplemented
with 1% glutamine (GIBCO) and 15% heat
inactivated (56°C for 1 hr) fetal bovine serum
(Hazelton Dutchland). To reduce the chance
of an inapparent bacterial infection antibiotics
were omitted from stock cultures, but 100
IU/ml penicillin-100 pg/ml streptomycin
mixture (1% of the GIBCO stock solution)
was present during the exposure to
1,25(OH),D;. Absence of mycoplasma infec-
tion was confirmed by the autoradiographic
method (12).

Experimental cultures were initiated using
cells resuspended in fresh culture medium at
the density of 2 X 10° cells/ml. Cell prolif-
eration was assessed by counting the cells in
a Neubauer hemocytometer. Cell viability
was determined by dye exclusion after ex-
posure to 0.02% trypan blue, counting 300
cells. The doubling time of the viable cell
population was found to be 24-36 hr.

Markers of monocytic differentiation. Cel-
lular morphology was examined in air-dried
smears stained with May—Grunwald—Giemsa
solution. The principal cytological criterion
of granulocytic differentiation was the pres-
ence of a nuclear constriction or segmenta-
tion, and monocytic differentiation was rec-

 

ognized by an oval or indented nucleus and
a reduction in cell size from the undifferen-
tiated blast form.

The occurrence of differentiation was con-
firmed by the following functional markers:

(a) Nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reduc-
tion. Approximately 2 < 10° cells were har-
vested and incubated at 37°C for 30 min in
1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 66
mf phosphate, 100 m/% NaCl, pH 7.4,
containing 0.1% NBT and 0.1 mg% phorbol-
12-myristate-13-acetate in the presence of |
mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Smears were
made by resuspending the cells in a drop of
0.5% albumin and spreading on a glass slide.
Cells showing blue deposits of formazan were
scored as positive for myelo-monocytic dif-
ferentiation, counting a total of 300 cells on
coded slides.

(b) Phagocytosis of opsonized sheep eryth-
rocytes. Sheep red blood cells (rbc) (Hazelton
Dutchland) were washed three times with
PBS and placed on ice for 30 min with rabbit
antisheep hemolysin diluted 1:500 with PBS.
HL 60 cells and opsonized sheep rbc were
mixed in 1:10 ratio and incubated at 37°C
for 90-120 min. After the incubation period
the adherent but not phagocytosed rbe were
lysed by resuspending the cells in Tris-buff-
ered (pH 7.2) 0.83% ammonium chloride for
2-5 min at room temperature. Air-dried
smears were stained with May—Grunwald-
Giemsa stain, and the proportion of cells
containing ingested rbc enumerated counting
300 cells.

The monocytic nature of differentiation
was assessed by the proportion of total cells
in culture which were adherent to flask sur-
faces or to one another. Following this enu-
meration the adherent cells were detached by
gentle pipetting and the cells were harvested
by centrifugation at 1000 rpm (IEC 6000
centrifuge) for 10 min. Dried smears were
fixed in an ice-cold mixture of 37% buffered
Formalin (pH 6.6), acetone, and water (25:
45:30) at 4°C for 30 sec, and stained for
nonspecific esterase activity by the method
of Yam (13), using a-naphthyl butyrate
(Sigma) in place of a-naphthyl acetate, and
without using a counterstain. Three hundred
cells were scored on coded slides.
