FIG, 3. (Rows A-D) Autoradiograms of dot blots of
total RNA extracted from HL 60 cells immediately
following treatment with 2.4 x 1078 Af 1,25(OH)2D, for
varying periods of time. The RNA was applied to
nitrocellulose filters and hybridized to c-myc cDNA
nick-translated with ?2P. Note a reduction in cellular
content of c-myc mRNA after periods of exposure to
1,25(OH)sD; longer than 2 hr. (Row A) Serial dilutions
(indicated as ug) of RNA from untreated HL 60 cells.
(Row B) RNA from HL 60 cells exposed to 2.4 * 10-8
M 1,25(OH).D; for 2 hr. (Row C) Cells exposed to the
inducer for 4 hr. (Row D) Cells exposed to the inducer
for 6 hr. (Rows E and F) Dot blots hybridized to a
cDNA probe of gene p 72. There is no evidence of any
change in the expression of this gene during 6 hr of
exposure of HL 60 cells to 2.4 x 10-2 Mf 1,25(OH).D3.
(Row E) Serial dilutions of RNA from untreated cultures.
(Row F) Serial dilutions of RNA from cultures exposed
to 2.4 X 1078 Af 1,25(OH).D; for 6 hr. Concentrations
of RNA indicated along the bottom line are in ee of
RNA applied to the filter,

rows A-C). If the exposure to 1,25(0H).D;
is continued, c-mye mRNA becomes barely
detectable (<2% of control) after 2 additional
hr (Fig. 3, row D). This effect is considerably
more marked than that described by Reitsma
et al. (7), who found 50% reduction in c-myc
RNA levels at 4 hr of treatment, but still
detected significant levels of cmyc mRNA

in BL 60 cells treated for 72 hr with 10-7 Af
1,25(OH)2D3. The shut-down of c-myc gene
is at least to some extent specific, since the
expression of an unrelated gene, p 72 (16),
is unaltered by the treatment of HL 60 cells
with 1,25(OH).D; (Fig. 3, rows E and F).

These experiments were repeated using the
system of induction described here with sim-
ilar results. It was found that serum with-
drawal had no detectable effect on c-myc
RNA levels in control cultures, but the pres-
ence of | X 1077 Af 1,25(OH),D, resulted in
a dramatic decrease in c-myc RNA, maximal
at 6 hr (4 br with the inducer plus 2 hr in
normal medium). At this time c-myc RNA
concentration was less than 2% of the levels
found in control cultures subjected to a sim-
ilar regimen of serum deprivation (Fig. 4,
rows C and F). Interestingly, c-myc expression
appears to recover rapidly, reaching 75% of
control value at 10 hr, and approximately
normal values are observed at 14 hr (Fig. 4,
rows D and E).

Fic. 4. Autoradiogram of dot blots of RNA extracted
from HL 60 cells at 2 hr and then at four-hourly
intervals of the standard induction system. The 4-hr
period of exposure to 1 x 10-7 W 1,25(OH).D, in the
absence of serum was followed by reincubation in normal
medium, with thorough washes at the end of the treat-
meni, and again 2 hr later. The RNA on nitrocellulose
filters was hybridized to c-mye cDNA nick-translated
with *P, There is a marked drop in the levels of c-myc
RNA at 6 hr of this treatment, (Row A) Serial dilutions
(indicated as yg of RNA along the bottom of the
autoradiogram) of RNA extracted from untreated cultures

treated cultures at 6 hr. (Row D) RNA from treated
cultures at 10 br. (Row E) RNA from treated cultures
