The finding that the level of c-myc mRNA
is reduced during the initiation of differentia-
tion by the “vitamin D pulse” procedure is
consistent with the view that a decrease in
the expression of c-myc gene acts as a stim-
ulus for the events which lead to terminal
differentiation of HL 60 cells.

Discussion. The induction of monocytic
differentiation of HEL 60 celis by a brief
exposure to a vitamin D analog should pro-
vide a system useful for the study of several
puzzling aspects of the control of differentia-
tion of leukemic cells. It may permit a clearer
picture of the relationship of the events which
initiate a differentiation pathway to the phases
of the cell cycle, the importance of which is
suggested by the transient prolongation of
the generation time observed during induc-
tion of differentiation by the procedure de-
scribed here (Fig. 2), and in several other
differentiating cell populations (18-22). Fur-
ther, the well-delineated progression toward
the differentiated phenotype (Fig. 1) may
facilitate a step by step analysis of the bio-
chemical events which lead from the initiation
of the process, presumably at genomic level,
to its final expression as changes in cell
structure, enzyme levels, and membrane
properties, the well-documented markers of
monocyte-like differentiation (6-9, 13).
