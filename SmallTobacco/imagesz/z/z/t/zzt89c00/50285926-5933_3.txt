Note. The values shown for percentages represent the mean of three experiments + SD. Cell adherence was
assessed by the proportion of cells forming clumps and adhering to culture flask wall, ***corresponding to 50-75%
adherent cells. The 4-hr exposure to 1,25(OH):D3 took place in the absence of serum.

in early experiments the sharp rise in the
proportion of differentiated cells which began
at approximately 10 hr from induction and
peaked between 30-40 hr (see below) was
followed by a more gradual increase in dif
ferentiated cells which continued during the
period of observation. However, when the
washing of HL 60 cells was repeated 2 hr
after the induction period, and the cells in-
cubated in another batch of fresh medium,

this increase did not continue after 36 hr.
This indicates that intracellular 1,25(O0H)2D;
diffuses out of the cells when its external
concentration is lowered, and concentrations
effective for induction may be removed by a
repeat wash after several hours. Under these
conditions a cohort of HL 60 cells with the
differentiated phenotype is observed (Fig. 1).
