290 DIFFERENTIATION OF HL 60 CELLS BY 1,25(0H).D,

Total cellular RNA was extracted from 25
X 10° cells for each time point by the guan-
idinium—hot phenol method (14) taking pre-
cautions to maintain sterile and RNase-free
conditions, and stored in 70% ethanol at
—70°C. For dot blotting the RNA was dis-
solved in sterile water, quantitated by absor-
bance at 260 nm, and blotted at several
dilutions onto nitrocellulose filters which had
been previously equilibrated with 20% SSC
(1 x SSC is 0.15 AY NaCl and 0.015 At
sodium citrate). The blots were then air
dried, baked overnight under vacuum at
80°C, and hybridized to cDNA nick-trans-
Jated probes p myc 7.4 and p 72 (15, 16). p
Myc 7.4 is a 1.2 kb cDNA fragment of the
second and third exons of the c-myc gene
inserted at the Pst 1 site of pBR322 (15).
Probe p 72 is a cloned genomic DNA frag-
ment from the human tumor cell line A 549
ligated to the pML-TK-Bgl 11 plasmid by
Dr. Pater (16), and is known to contain an
expressed portion of human tumor cell ge-
nome. Hybridization to either probe was
performed according to Muller et al. (17).
Briefly, the blots were incubated for at least
4 hr at 45°C with the prehybridization buffer
(0.2 mil/cm?) containing 0.75 M4 NaCl, 0.05 Af
sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.005 Af EDTA,
0.2% SDS, 10 mg/ml glycine, 5X Denhardt’s
reagent (1 is 0.02% each of Ficoll, bovine
serum albumin, and polyvinylpyrrolidone),
0.25 mg/ml of denatured salmon sperm
DNA, and an equal volume of deionized
formamide. Subsequently, the blots were hy-
bridized for 20 hr at 45°C with 1 X 106 cpm
of nick-translated probe (sp act 107-108 cpm/
ug DNA)/ml of hybridization buffer (0.05
ml/cm?), which has the same composition as
the prehybridization buffer except that the
concentration of Denhardt’s reagent was re-
duced to 1X. The blots were washed thor-
oughly three times (2 hr each wash) with 1x
SSC at 50°C, air dried, and exposed to X-
ray films with the use of an intensifying
screen at —70°C for 72 hr. The intensity of
developed autoradiograms was quantitated
using a Hoefer Scientific Instruments (San
Francisco, Calif.) G.S. 300 transmittance/
reflectance scanning densitometer.
Chemicals. 1-«,25-Dihydroxycholecalcif-
erol was provided by the courtesy of Dr.
Gary Truitt and Dr. Milan Uskokovic, Hoff:

 

mann-La Roche, Nutley, New Jersey. The
stock solution of this compound was prepared
in absolute ethanol and stored at —20°C.
Appropriate dilution with the culture medium
was made just before use, and control me-
dium was prepared by adding the equivalent
volume of the ethanol solvent. This control
medium had no distinguishable effect when
compared with cells cultured in medium
without the solvent.

Results. J. The “pulse’’ procedure jor in-
duction of differentiation. Exponentially grow-
ing HL 60 cultures of the strain cultivated in
this laboratory show only a small proportion
of spontaneously differentiated cells, gener-
ally not exceeding 3%. After exposure to
1,25(0H).D, an increasing number of cells
exhibit the characteristics of the more mature
forms, as shown by the ability to phagocytose
red blood celis, the nonspecific esterase re-
action, and adherence to the culture flask
wall (Table I). In our experiments 2.4 * £078
M 1,25(OH),D; (10 ng/ml) produces 95%
complete differentiation in approximately 70
hr. As reported by others (6, 9), increasing
the concentration of this inducer accelerates
the differentiation only slightly, and periods
of exposure shorter than 16 hr are not suffi-
cient for an effective induction of differentia-
tion. However, when the short exposure to
1,25(OH)2D; takes place in medium not sup-
plemented with fetal calf serum, a significant
proportion of cells acquires the differentiated
phenotype when examined after a lapse of
time approximately equivalent to a cell cycle
generation time (Table I).

These experiments also indicated that a
4-hr period of induction is optimal for the
appearance of a discrete cohort of differen-
tiated cells. Shorter periods of exposure to
1,25(0H)2D, resulted in smaller and less
reproducible numbers of differentiated cells,
while periods longer than 4 hr did not mark-
edly augment differentiation. It was also felt
that the period of incubation without serum
should be kept as short as possible, to mini-
mize a chance of reduced cell viability due
to the lack of essential nutrients. The 4-hr
period without serum did not produce de-
tectable cytotoxicity or loss of viability (data
not included),

The induction period was followed by a
thorough washing of the cells to remove
