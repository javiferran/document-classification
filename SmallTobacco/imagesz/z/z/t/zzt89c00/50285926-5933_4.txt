4-hr exposure to 1,25(OH)2D; or for approx-
imately 6 hr afterward. After this latent period
several indicators of monocytic differentiation
become apparent and peak at 28-32 hr,
depending on the concentration of 1,25(OH).D;
used (Table | and Fig. 1). A fourfold increase
in the concentration of this inducer produced
only a small (approximately 5%) increase in
the height of this peak, but the rate of
decrease in the proportion of differentiated
cells is slower after induction with the higher
concentration of 1,25(OH)sD3.

Control cultures not exposed to 1,25(OH).D3
but handled in an identical manner to the
experimental groups, including a 4-hr period
in the absence of serum, showed a small but
reproducible peak of differentiated cells at
approximately the same time as the vitamin-
treated cultures (Fig. 1). Thus, a small pro-
portion of phenotypically differentiated cells
observed at 25-42 hr may have been induced
by the handling rather than by the inducer.

The 4-hr pulse of 1,25(O0H)2D3 produced
a small but reproducible and _ statistically
significant retardation in the rate of cell
proliferation, determined by cell numbers
per milliliter of culture, 24 hr after induction
(Fig. 2). Thereafter, the cultures showed iden-

tical rates of growth, indicating that the re-
tardation occurred only within the first 24 hr
of exposure to the inducer. The two concen-
trations of 1,25(OH).D3 used in these exper-
iments produced similar degrees of growth
retardation (Fig. 2). Thus, if the inducing
drug is removed, HL 60 cells can undergo at
least 3 divisions at approximately normal
rate although a large proportion of the cells
in culture are differentiating.

3. Gene expression during cohort differ-
entiation of HL 60 cells. It has been reported
that the expression of c-myc oncogene is
reduced in HL 60 cells induced to differen-
tiate by an exposure to 1,25(OH):D3 (7),
raising the possibility that these events are
causally related. It therefore appeared impor-
tant to determine if significant changes in
c-myc expression occur when the pulse pro-
cedure induction described here is employed,
and the chronology of the genomic and phe-
notypic changes. We observed that, assuming
a steady state of c-myc mRNA metabolism,
the expression of this gene is changed little
during the first 2 hr of exposure to 2.4 x 1078
M 1,25(OH).D3;, but falls sharply thereafter,
being less than 20% of the basal level at 4
hr, the end of the induction period (Fig. 3,
