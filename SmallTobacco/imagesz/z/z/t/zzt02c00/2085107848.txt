Carolyn,

The admin. staff indicated that you need to sign all of the "450" vouchers regardless of $$ amount. Did we get this issue
resolved as it is certainly a waste of your time to have to sign minimal $$ amounts that | am authorized to sign?

Thanks and Ben if you have information to share, please do so.
