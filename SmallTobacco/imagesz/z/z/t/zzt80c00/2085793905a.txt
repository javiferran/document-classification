Subject: Hammer Thoughts

Harold-wanted to check in with you on what you thought of your Hammer experience this week. Derrick seemed to
think you got a lot out of it.

| would love to pick your brain on how you see us being able to bring some of the process thinking here. | know there
has been some hesitancy on DAveâ€™s part to bring Hammer in to talk at senior team level-what do you think about at
the OBT level! or the next level down??

| hope we can find some time to discuss.
Look forward to hearing back from you-Dan
