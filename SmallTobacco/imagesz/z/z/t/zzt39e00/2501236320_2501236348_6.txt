“IETS :

For an individual consuming unusually high

i amounts of lettuce, high
likely intake if all that lettuce aieni

contained residues of 225 mg/kg would be
0.054 x 225

= = 0.20 agCS,/kg bw/day.
Tf all the residue were EBDC fuen equivalent theoretical intake of ETYy
would be

0.2 x 0.1§ = 0.03 ng/k

Limited experimental evidence indicates that 1t may be possible for treated
spinach to contain, in some circumstances, residues of EBDC up to 50 ag
CS ,/kg.

For an individual consuming unusually high amounts of spinach,

highest
likely antake if ali that spinach contained residues o

£ $0 mg/kg would be

-077 x 50

= 0.064 ag CS4/kg bw/day
60

equivalent to 0.01 mg ETU/kg bw/day

b. ETU (raw ‘s0ds)

 

Commodities with Codex MRLs have been included and residues at the Codex
MRL have been assumed unless data indicate otherwise.

ETU cesidues are low in fresh treated food but theoretical maximum intakes ~
have been calculated to complete the £TU intake picture. Commodities
included in these calculations sre those for which data are available (see
Table $.3) and are representative of all treated commodities.
