ce) ETU_ (processed food} .
ETU can be produced from EBDCs when treated crops are processed,
particularly where heat 1s involved.

zanfants have a hagh intake of processed ipple

products in relation to their
Dedyweight, therefore worst case intake: have been calculated for infants.
An additional assumption is added here, that produces are prepared

eee from whole unwashed apples with highest likely residues see
table 5.4.

3 These concentrations are based on data from laboratory scale
processing experiment using apples with high residues (4 ag/kg).

For an infant consuming unusually high azgounts of apple products,
highest likely intake if all apple products contained highest likely
residues would be 0.006 ng/kg

bw/day.

There ig limited evidence that high residues of ETU (10 ag/kg) may, in
certain circumstances, occur in canned spinach.

Consumption data are not available for canned spinach. Unusually high
(97.5th centile) consumption of canned vegetables other than pulses,
potatoes or tomatoes is 0.082 kg/day. For an adult consusing this amount

of canned spinach, highest likely intake if all that spinach contained 10ag Ss
