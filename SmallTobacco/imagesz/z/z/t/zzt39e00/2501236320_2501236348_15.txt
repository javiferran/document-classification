When compared with the no-effect level of 13 ag/kg/day based on an
increased incidence of liver tumours in the 2 year souse study these
calculations give safety factors of 15,960 for adults, $000 for children
and 2500 for infants. In the most unlikely event of high consuaption of
lettuce containing the high residues occasionally found in monitoring, a
_ Safety factor of S00 is obtained for adults .

when compared with the no-effect level for ETU 3f 1.78 we/ke/d
90 day rat study based on altered thyroid hormone levels theg Svea she
safety factor of 1800 for adults, 600 for children and 300 for infants. As
_., above, a worst case safety factor can be calculated on the assuaption that
; an individual aay eat large amounts of lettuce containing the high residues
¥ ' occasionally found in monitoring. The resultant safety factor is 60.
~~ There is evidence to show that the rat is auch sore sensitive than san-to
zrethe effect of ETU on thyroid hormone levels therefore these safety margins
+, are sufficient. In addition the mechanism of toxicity ts known and |
“persistent exposure to high levels of ETU is needed for there to be any
adverse effect. In practice the worst case scenarios which fora the basis
.'-O£ the highest-theoretical intakes are improbable and if exposures at these
-levels ever do occur they will be rare.
