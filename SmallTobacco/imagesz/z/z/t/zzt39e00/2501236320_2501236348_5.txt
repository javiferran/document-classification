Highest theoretical intakes of EBOC are calculated for consumers

of lar
amounts Of treated apples pears or soft fruat.

Theoretical intake of EBOC (expressed as cs.) = 0.008 ag/kg bw/day

Equivalent theoretical intake of ETU (sae footnote) 2 0.90! ng/kg bw/day.
Exposure of children is likaly to follow a similar pattern. Comparable food

intake data are not available for children so the calculation has been
based on consumption of one apple per day (see Table $.2).

Total dithiocarbamate residues in excess of § ng/kg have been found by the
Working Party on Pesticides Residues in some sasples of retail lettuce.

The highest residue found in 1/101 samples analysed in 1988/9 was 225
mg/kg.
