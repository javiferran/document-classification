Thyroid hormones are synthesised in the thyroid gland and stored in the
follicular lumen as amino acid residues of thyroglobulin. The various
stages of syntheses are as shown in Figure 3}.

Fig 3. Schematic representation of thyroid horsone biosynthesis and
secretion. The protein portion of thyroglobulin is synthesised on
rough endoplasaic reticulum and carbohydrate moieties are added by the
Golgi apparatus. Thyroglobulin proceeds to the apical surface in
secretory vesicles which fuse with the cell seabrane and discharge

‘ theirs contents into the lumen.* Iodide enters the cell by active -
transport, is oxidized by a peroxidase at the apical border,-and is

‘ incorporated into tyrosine residues in peptide linkage in

thyroglobulin. Two iodinated tyrosyl groups couple in either linkage
