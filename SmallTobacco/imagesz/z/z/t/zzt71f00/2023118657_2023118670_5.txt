KABAT SAMPLING/ANALYSIS TEST PLAN

Objectives:

Ll. To determine the amount of variation in the Kabat concentration
(PPM) within a hogshead of strip.

2. To determine the amount of variation in the Kabat application
and process systems at the Leaf Processing Facility (LPF).

3, To determine the average difference between Kabat (methoprene)
results generated at Universal Leaf Tobacco Company (ULT) using
the GC method and results generated at PM using the HPLC
method.

Test Plan:

1. Utilize one of the TQAF statistical technicians to obtain the
samples andi collect the data to achieve the aforementioned
objectives.

2. Consult with LPF Production Management to coordinate the
operating modes required for sampling.

3. Transport samples to J. Bazemore at the BL Plant for methoprene
analysis on the HPLC.

4. Summarize data, write, and issue a report.

Discussion:

The specifics of the test plan have not been detailed in this memo
because the exact logistics have not yet been worked out with LPF

and TQAF management. The plan which will be put forth will entail
the following:

1.

To: meet objective #1:

- Sample product exiting a single dryer* every thirty (30)
seconds for the duration of twenty (20) hogsheads.

- Sample (thief) the corresponding twenty (20) hogsheads.

- Expected total number of samples: approximately 220.

cIISTEEZO?Y

- Expected total number of manhours: varies depending on
production.
