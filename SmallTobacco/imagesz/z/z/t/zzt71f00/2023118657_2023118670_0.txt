SUBJECT: EVALUATION OF KABAT SAMPLING/ANALYSIS TEST AT LPF

Objectives;

1.

Determine the amount of variation in the Kabat concentration (PPM) within
a hogshead of strip.

Determine the amount of variation in the Kabat application and process
systems at the Leaf Processing Facility (LPF).

Determine the average difference between Kabat (methoprene) results
generated at Universal Leaf Tobacco Company (ULT) using the GC method and
results generated at PM using the HPLC method.

Conclusions:

1.

The average amount of variation in the Kabat concentration for the
fifteen (15) hogsheads which were sampled during the test was 1.1 PPM.
The "projected" average variation in the fourteen (14) hogsheads which
were not sampled was 1.3 PPM. Based on a 95% confidence interval of the
overall average variation, the Kabat concentration within an individual
hogshead can vary by + 2.4 PPM around the average value.

The Kabat flow for each system was set at a rate which was calculated to
achieve a projected Kabat value of 7.5 PPM at a constant rate of tobacco
throughput. The variation in each Kabat system at LPF was determined on

a 95% confidence interval. The data for each of the systems is as
follows:

System er# NL _x_ Projected Ae a foroaee sx_ 95% CI.
1 49 5.7 7.5 - 1.8 1.3 + 2.6
2 49 6.0 7.5 - 1.5 1.3 + 2.7
3 49 6.2 7.5 - 1.3 2.2 + 4,3

All parameters were held as steady as possible during the tests which
were conducted, therefore the estimates of variation for each system are
probably the best that can be achieved at this time. Under normal
operating conditions, the variation would probably be greater.
