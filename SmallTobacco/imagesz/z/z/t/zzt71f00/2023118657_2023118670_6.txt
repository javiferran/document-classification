2. To meet objective #2:

- Sample product exiting each dryer every five minutes for a
period of four (4) hours on each dryer.

- Record the tobacco throughput each time a sample is
obtained.

- Record corresponding Kabat calibration and processing
parameter data.

- Expected total number of samples: approximately 144.

- Expected total number of manhours: varies depending on
production.

3. To meet objective #3:

- Continue the routine sampling of the finished product.

- Continue to split the sample with one half going to ULT
for analysis and the other half going to J. Bazemore for
HPLC analysis.

- Provide J. Bazemore with the samples which have already

been obtained as soon as he is prepared to perform the
analysis.

* During this time, the product exiting the dryer must not be
combined with product from any other line when it goes to the
packer.

In order to accomplish the sampling before the end of the flue-cured
season, it will be necessary to start sampling no later than Monday,
October 16th. Plans are to meet with Production management at LPF
this week to work out the details of the production requirements.
Once these details have been finalized, a meeting will be arranged
with TQAF management concerning manpower requirements.

Please let me know if there are any questions concerning this plan.
