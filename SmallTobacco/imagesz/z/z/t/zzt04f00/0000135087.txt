APRIL 7, 1982

SUBJECT: SMOKING, EXERCISE AND HIGH DENSITY CHOLESTEROL

 

Two articles on the subject have appeared recently with contradictory
eet +,conclusions. On February 14, the Courier-Journal described a U of L
. study by Bryant Stamford who said that people who exercise have higher
HDC levels than non-exercisers but smoking cancels out this effect. On
the other hand, a Japanese researcher, S. Nakamura, reports that HDC
levels were found significantly higher in both smoking and non-smoking
exercisers compared to sedentary smokers.

Corporate Affairs may wish to inform the Courier-Journal of the
‘Japanese study.
