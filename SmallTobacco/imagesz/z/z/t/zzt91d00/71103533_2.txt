Unaided Brand Awareness:

Unaided Brand awareness levels have grown among total smokers and among MASU30 in the original markets. It
appears that after a longer exposure to the LS marketing effort, Lucky Strike is becoming more familiar in the
original markets than in the expansion markets which has a more recent Lucky Strike history.

Unaided Advertising Awareness:

Among the total sample, Unaided advertising awareness increased from 0.7% to 2.7% in the original Markets; and
from 1.3% to 2.0% in the expansion markets.

Results among ASU30 Males show a decline in both markets but more in the Expansion markets where unaided
Advertising fell from 6.5% to 3.3%.

Unaided Promotion awareness:

Among the total sample, Promotion awareness grew from 0.7 to 1.3% in the expansion markets where more
Promotional programs were implemented than in the original markets. Promotions like lighters, pre-pack shippers,
mystery shopper, and telemarketing were exclusive to the expansion markets in addition to B1G1F and metal tins
in both markets.

Unaided Promotion awareness however declined steeply among MASU30. This may be related to the timing of the
survey which was two months after the last promotions were concluded in the expansion markets; and six months
after the last B1GIF promotions which qualitative research has shown has better impact on ASU30s.

Unaided Direct Mail awareness:

Unaided DM awareness grew among total smokers in both markets and among ASU30 Males in the original
markets. The general increase in DM awareness could be attributed to two direct mail offerings made in 1998. The
‘Rooftop’ offer in April was exclusive to the expansion markets while the ‘multi-sensory’ offer of August covered all
the test markets.

Unaided DM awareness however declined among MASU30 in the expansion markets. This may be related to the
timing of the survey, which was two months after the last Direct Mail offerings were concluded in the expansion
markets

Direct mail awareness level is generally higher among MASU30 smokers than total smokers. This could be
attributed to the two direct mail offerings made in 1998 were both targeted at ASU30 smokers.
