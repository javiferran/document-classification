Retail Stores
Retail Stores as a source of advertising awareness has declined in both markets among both smoker groups.

B1G1F was launched just before wave 1. This promotion increased awareness levels in retail stores in wave. By
wave 2 however, there was no immediate in-store promotion and the last promotional activity was metal tins, which
may not have as much impact on the consumer as B1G1F.

Retail Stores however remain the biggest source of awareness in the expansion markets, and among Male ASU30.

Direct Mail

Direct Mail ranks next to Retail Stores as the most prominent source of advertising awareness among Male ASU30
smokers. Among Male ASU30 smokers, Direct Mail remained flat at 5.4% in the original markets and declined in
the expansion markets from 6.5% to 4.0%.

The first Direct Mail program in 1997 was launched just before the first wave while the second one was launched in
August — two months before wave 2. This may explain why Direct Mail has declined in wave 2 among MASU30
smokers.

Billboards:
Billboards were a growing source of awareness for Lucky Strike between waves 1 and 2. Even though outdoor
advertising was pulled from the Expansion markets just before the second wave.

Magazines:
Magazines grew from 2.0 to 2.7% among total smokers in the Original markets. Magazines however declined

among Male ASU30 smokers both in the original and expansion markets. Magazines remain a strong source of
advertising awareness in the original markets.

Bars:

Bars are the only source of advertising awareness that has grown consistently in both markets among both groups
of smokers, Among total smokers, Bars grew from nil to 0.7% in both markets; and among MASU30 smokers, Bars
grew from 0.7 to 1.4% in the original markets and from nil to 1.3% in the expansion markets.

Newspapers: Newspapers as a source has declined in both markets among both smoker gropups.
