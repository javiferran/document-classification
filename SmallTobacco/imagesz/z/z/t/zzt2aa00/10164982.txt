Dear Dr. Weinbaum:

I will be pleased to continue our electron microscopic research
of the ultrastructure of the alveolar septum in collaboration with the
research laboratories of Albert Einstein Medical Center. I will be
involved in the development of staining techniques for the specific
localization of amorphous elastin, microfibrillar elastin and neutrophil
elastase. I will aiso be involved in evaluating the earliest changes
seen at the ultrastructural level resulting from the induction of
emphysema by neutrophil elastase.

Sincerely yours,
COPE .
