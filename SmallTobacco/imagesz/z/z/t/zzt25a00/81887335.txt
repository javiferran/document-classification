Jordan,

According to Larsen. both of your concerns have been addressed. Check out
the staging site at www. buttoutnow.com: 7070

Unfortunately, my computer setup does not allow me to look at screensavers.
Iam getting this issue resolved as soon as possible but let me know if you
have any more concerns.

Tf I don't hear from you. congratulations and good luck next week!
Jason

Have they aleo looked into my complaint that there is a palpable three-or—-so
second delay from when you click "exit" until you're "released" back to your
computer?
