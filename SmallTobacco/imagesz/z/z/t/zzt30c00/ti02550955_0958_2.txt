The claim has also been made that ETS te a health riak for those suffering from
aathma and heart disease. The research available on this iesue te Limited and
conflicting, but tt has not been scientifically eatablished that ETS provokes
adverse health effects in such people, who may be bothered by many things
encountered in public places ~ including also aerosols, perfumes.... It ta
recognised that their psychological reactions to the annoyances they encounter
may aggravate their physical state,‚Äù but there is an obvious need for spectal
courtesy towards persons who say they are so annoyed.

The allegation that parents' smoking has adverse health effects on children ie
one which evokes a great deal of emotion but which is not clearly established by
research, Some studies have pointed out that factors other than etgarette
smoking must be taken into account in examining a child's health, ineluding: a
history of infection in the home, the location of the home in relatton to
industry and other exposure to industrial and domestic pollutants, ineluding
cleaning fluids and solvents, building materials (such as asbestos), radon, the

use of gas cooking stoves, and ao on.

For antt-smokers, however, the scientifie validity of the health allegations is rarely
an tssue in publie discussions on this subject: rather it te the emotional impact of
such claims which is given prominence, partteularly in media coverage. Because it
appeals to emotion, and because it fits in with the current "healthier ltfestyle"
trend, the iesue of the non-smoker's health has become the basis for legislation
regulating smoking in publie places and banning smoking in the workplace, although no
substantive sctentifie basis has been established on health grounds for such

limitations on the personal activity of individuals.
in the absence of such evidence, what is needed now is not further legislation, but |

more setentifie research and, in the meantime, more tolerance and courtesy, from

smokers and non-smokers alike.
