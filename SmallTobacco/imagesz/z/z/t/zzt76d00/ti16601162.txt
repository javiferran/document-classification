Dear Tom:

I am writing te you about a "Dear Colleague" letter that you
sent on August 4 regarding H.R. 3434.

I am not surprised, of course, that we disagree on this
issue. I am surprised and disappointed, however, that you have
taken such a personal tone in your criticism. There is no
substantive argument in the Nickie McWherter column excerpt you
circulated to our colleagues; instead, it is a mean-spirited
attack on my character and reputation.

I have come to expect these tactics from the tobacco
companies, but not fram you. I am sorry you saw fit to respond
to our disagreement over H.R. 3434 in this way.

Sin ely,

 
  

HENRYâ€™ A. Wt
Member of Congress
