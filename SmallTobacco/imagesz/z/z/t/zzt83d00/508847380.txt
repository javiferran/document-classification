Re: Calcium and Silicon Entrainment Data on Carbonized Cotton Linter
Sheet Material

The HRRC requested that calcium and silicon entrainment data be collected on
cigarette samples prepared with carbonized cotton linter sheet. The test
product, Sample G, contained 50% sheet material which had 60% by weight CaC03.
(Sample G, see memo). Mr. R. T. White, Jr. has analyzed cigarettes with up to
30% total weight CaCO3 per cigarette (Samples A, B and F). Based on his anal-
ysis, calcium in the ash for Sample G was 63, 751 + 2985 ug/cigarette, i.e.
4.434 times the level of calcium in the control (WINSTON KS). The silicon in
the ash was 3122 g/cigarette for the test product (Sample G) and 3339 ug/
cigarette for WINSTON KS. Calcium entrained into the mainstream smoke for the
test product G was at a level equal to WINSTON KS (0.02 1g/cigarette) and
silicon entrainment into mainstream smoke was 0.042 ug/cigarette versus 0.066
ug silicon/cigarette for WINSTON KS.

The results indicate that the majority of the calcium, from the CaC03 present
in the carbonized cotton linter sheet, resides in the cigarette ash >99%. The
amount of silicon in the ash is about equal to that found in WINSTON KS. The
amount of calcium and silicon entrainment for the test product G was no
greater than the control. All values for silicon were at or below the limit
of detection for mainstream smoke at 0.05 ug/cigarette.

As a result of these tests, we request permission for use of carbonized cotton
linter sheet material containing calcium carbonate in a blend of tobaccos of
up to a level of 30 weight percent calcium (see Sample G).
