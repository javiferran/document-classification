Hi - thoughi I'd give my 2cents on the new sign holder. This is my thought (and only mine) before putting this

In front of the SDT.......

* good concept and like the flexibility of pricing changes. Could we design the Slide By to do the same -
Offer area w/ spiral #'s and we only provide an insert for the graphics? | realize there could be issues w/
product deal offer communication but maybe we can find a creative way to address this.

* I'm concemed about adding more signage. Though the sign Is small and fundamentally more flexible
than the slide-by. will we add to the fixture signage (6+ vs 3 - if you Include slide-by's). More importantly,
will accounts opt fo remove slide-by's in favor of smaller signs and thereby, we have less graphic
capabillties? Just a thought to consider, or maybe you have.

| reviewed the naming/size document and feel that you can provide the necessary Input....but I'll also give

you my 2cents,

« My thought is consistency In naming is a good thing for systems and communication input. Just keep
your marketing hat on for sizing so we don't get boxed in. A possibility is max / min total sq inches and
thus, we can work within different shapes within the total real estate. (i.e. the Parliament and Milds
arrow was effective - minimal sq inches and not confined to height and width). This will also give the
agency some more flexibillty since frankly. sometimes are creative is forced to fit and I'd prefer the
agency be given some creative flexibllity (good thing for the agency). | do think you should revisit the
number sizes to Insure consistency and insure we have the right sizes appropriate for the piece (maybe
smaller, maybe the same).

That's all folks. I'm sure you'll take it in the right direction,
