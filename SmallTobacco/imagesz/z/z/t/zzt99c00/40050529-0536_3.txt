Fig. 3. Characterization of apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons.
Panels A to C depict cerebellar granule neurons stained with the
fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342 and visualized under a UV light micro-
scope (1000x). Bar = 10 4M. Panels D to F depict cerebellar granule
neurons stained with TUNEL and visualized under a light microscope
(1000x). Bar = 10 4M. A and D) Neurons exposed to normal culture
medium for 8 h. 8 and E) Neurons exposed to the apoptotic medium for
8h, © and F) Neurons exposed to the apoptotic medium in the pres-
ence of 25 4M Pb!‘ for 8h. Note in panels C and F that the numbers
of Hoechst 33342 fluorescent and of TUNEL positive cells are in-
creased after Pb** exposure. Also note in panels D, & and F that
TUNEL staining of apeptotic cells shows shrinkage and incorporation of
labeled nucleotide into the nucleus and that in the early stage of
apoptosis, labeling is most intense at the periphery of the nucleus.
Panel G depicts agarose gel electrophoresis of internucleosomal DNA
fragments from cerebeltar granule neurons kept in culture medium (lane
2), 24 h after application of the apoptotic medium (lane 3) and 24h after
a 30-min pulse with 100 2M glutamate in Mg * ‘-free medium (ane 7).
The addition of 25 4M Po~~ to the apoptotic medium reveals a micro-
somal-size DNA fragmentation pattern after 8 h {lane 4), which is
abolished when cells are preincubated in 3.5 ~M cycloheximide (lane 5)
or 0.8 4M actinomycin D (lane 6). DNA size markers appear in lane 1.

the onset of neuronal death. The majority of neurons under-
went death in 4 to 6 h, and virtually all neurons were dead
after 8 h of exposure to the apoptotic medium (fig. 4A).

Fig. 4. Pb** facilitates the onset of apoptosis in cerebellar granule
neurons. A} Time-dependent onset of apoptosis induced by the apo-
ptotic medium and by the apoptotic medium and 100 2M Pbt*. All
cultures were stained with fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide
to determine cell death. The data represent the % neuronal death
(mean + S.E.M.) of 4 to 6 culture dishes from a representative exper-
iment (" P < 0.01 when compared with the corresponding control celis).
The experiment was repeated three times with consistent results. Note
that 0.8 2M actinomycin D (act. D) prevents apoptotic death elicited by
the apoptotic medium either in the absence or in the presence of PbT*.
(B) Pb** facilitation of neuronal apoptosis is concentration-dependent.
Cerebellar granule neurons were exposed for 8 h to normal culture
medium or to apaptotic medium containing different concentrations of
Pb**. The data represent the % neuronal death (mean + S.E.M.) of
triplicate experiments (“ P < 0.01 when compared with the respective
controls).

around 10 uM, neurotoxic effects were already detectable at
1 uM (fig. 4B). The following evidence confirms that the
neurotoxicity accelerated by Pb’ ' was due to apoptosis: 1)
The neuronal death, in the apoptotic medium, after 8 h of
exposure to Pb*” was greatly reduced by adding serum and
increasi:g the concentration of K* from 5 to 25 mM (fig. 4B).
2) There was an earlier onset of DNA laddering (fig. 3G),
chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation (fig. 3, C
and F), 3) Actinomycin D or cycloheximide in doses them-
selves devoid of neurotoxicity prevented neuronal death (fig.
4A) and internuclcosomal DNA fragmentation (fig. 8G).
