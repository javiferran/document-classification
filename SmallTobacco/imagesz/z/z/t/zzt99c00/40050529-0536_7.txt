Naltrexone on Responding Maintained by Food, Cocaine, Heroin and Cocaine/Heroin
Combinations in Rats, JPET Vol. 277(3): 1247-1258, 1996.

The authors regret that the first footnote to the article was incorrect. The footnote should

read as follows:

1 This research was supported in part by USPHS research grants DA-01999 (JES),
DA-00114 (JES), DA-03628 (JES) and DA-06634 (JES, SID). All research was con-
ducted according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as adopted
and promulgated by the National Institutes of Health.

ERRATUM

George E, Billman and Robert L. Hamlin: The Effects of Mibefradil, a Novel Calcium
Channel Antagonist on Ventricular Arrhythmias Induced by Myocardial Ischemia and
Programmed Electrical Stimulation, JPET Vol. 277(3): 1517-1526, 1996,

The authors regret that three figures have been transposed in the article “The Effects of
Mibefradil, a Novel Calcium Channel Antagonist on Ventricular Arrhythmias Induced by
Myocardial Ischemia and Programmed Electrical Stimulation” by G. E. Billman and R. L.
Hamlin, Vol. 277(3): 1517-1526. Specifically, figure 11 should be shown as figure 13,
figure 12 should be shown as figure 11 and figure 13 should be shown as figure 12.
