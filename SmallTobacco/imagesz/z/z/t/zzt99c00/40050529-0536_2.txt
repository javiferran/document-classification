and serum but in the presence of 10 4M glycine, became
necrotic within 4 to 24 h at rates proportional to the concen-
tration of glutamate applied (fig. 1). The following morpho-
logical and biochemical features were observed: an immedi-
ate swelling of neuronal cell bodies, followed at 4 h by
widespread neuronal degeneration; neither protection with
cycloheximide or actinomycin D pretreatment (fig. 2) nor
DNA ladder (fig. 3G) was detectable. Glutamate neurotoxic-
ity was prevented by pretreatment of the cells with the non-
competitive glutamate/(NMDA receptor antagonist dizo-
cilpine (fig. 2), Ph** at a concentration of 25 4M failed to
produce attenuation of glutamate-induced neuronal necrosis
(fig. 1), but 50 and 100 M Pb**, which by themselves,
increase neuronal death, also reduced glutamate-induced
neurotoxicity.

Neurotoxic action of Pb**. Pb** antagonized gluta-
mate neurotoxicity, but surprisingly, 50 to 100 4.M Pb** by
itself induced neurotoxicity in a manner resistant to a dose of
dizocilpine that prevented glutamate neurotoxicity (fig. 2).
Pb'" neurotoxicity was blocked by cycloheximide or actino-
mycin D pretreatment (fig. 2). Exposure of cultures to 100
uM Pb** for 3 to 5 days (data not shown) also resulted in a
cycloheximide- or actinomycin D-sensitive but dizocilpine-
insensitive neuronal death (approximately 50% of cell death).
These initial results suggest that Pb**-induced neuronal
death in cerebellar culture is apoptotic-like rather than ne-
crotic.

Effect of Pb** on apoptotic cerebellar granule neu-
rons. Apoptosis was induced by exposing cultured cerebellar
granule neurons to a medium lacking FCS but containing a
physiological KCl concentration (5 mM) and 5 uM dizocilpine
to prevent Ca7 *-dependent necrosis by persistent glutamate
receptor stimulation. When 8-DIV neuronal cultures were
placed in this medium, which we provisionally termed apo-
ptotic medium, a widespread neuronal degeneration with

Fig. 1. Pb** elicits a dose-related decrease in glutamate-induced
neurotoxicity in cerebellar granule cells. The ordinate shows % neuro-
nal death (mean + S.E.M., 9 = 5) measured 24 h after 30 min of
exposure to glutamate (25-100 ,M) in Mg**-free Locke's solution in
the presence of 10 4M glycine. Pb* * was added with glutamate for the
30-min exposure period. * P < 0.01 when glutamate-treated celis were
compared with the respective untreated cells; ** P < 0.01 when Pb**-
treated but not glutamate-treated cells were compared with the control
cells (no Pb**, no glutamate). Note that Pb** at 50 and 100 uM
reduces glutamate neurotoxicity, whereas at 25 ..M it fails to produce
statistically significant (P > 0.05} changes in glutamate neurotoxicity.

characteristic features of apoptosis occurred after 24 h; it was
completed within 72 h (fig. 4A). In these cultures, most of the
neurons were no longer well rounded but rather exhibited
granular and shrunken cell bodies and chromatin condensa-
tion that could be visualized after staining with the fluores-
cent dye Hoechst 33342 (fig. 3, A, B and C). Death was
accompanied by the appearance of a DNA ladder upon aga-
rose ge! electrophoresis (fig. 3G) and positive nuclear stain-
ing with the TdT labeling of fragmented DNA (TUNEL) (fig.
3, D, E and F). DNA laddering and other signs of apoptotic
death were virtually abolished by pretreatment of the culture
with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide or with
the RNA polymerase inhibitor actinomycin D (fig. 3G). Addi-
tion of Ph** to the apoptotic medium considerably shortened
