Temporal aspects of Pb** action on apoptosis. Cere-
bellar granule cells exposed to the apoptotic medium for 10h
were incubated for different time periods with Pb**. As
shown in figure 5, the increase in neuronal death induced by
10h of exposure to the apoptotic medium (open bar) was
markedly potentiated in the presence of Ph ~* (dashed bars).
Potentiation of Pb** neurotoxicity, however, became pro-
gressively less effective when Pb*7 was added with a delay
after the application of the apoptotic medium. When Pb**
was added to the apoptotic medium during the last 2 h of
incubation, potentiation of neurotoxicity was virtually non-
existent (fig. 5).

Role of Ca** in Pb**t-induced apoptosis. Among the
heavy metals, Pb*™ is the most potent inhibitor of VSCC
(Audesirk, 1993). To investigate whether Pb** facilitates
apoptosis in our experimental model by reducing Ca** entry
into the cells, we exposed cerebellar granule cells for 8 h to
the apoptotic medium with or without Pb*~, in the presence
or in the absence of the L-type Ca** channel agonist Bay
K8644 (Franklin and Johnson, 1992; Galli e¢ al., 1995; Hagi-
wara and Byerly, 1981; Carboni and Wojcik, 1988). As shown
in figure 6B, adding Bay K8644 to the apoptotic medium
reduced in a dose-related manner the neuronal death elicited
by Pb**, and Pb** competes with the neuroprotective action
of 0.25 uM Bay K8644 (fig. 6A). Similar protective effects of
Bay K8644 were observed against apoptotic neuronal death
induced by the application of nimodipine, a selective blocker
of L-type VSCC (Janis and Triggle, 1983). Adding nimodipine
(10 «M) to the culture medium for 48 h induced the death of
approximately 50% of the granule cells, an effect that wae
completely prevented by co-administration of 0.3 uM Bay
K8644 (table 1).

Fig. §. Temporal aspect of the action of Ph** on apoptotic death of
cerebellar granule neurons. Neurons were washed and expose: to the
apoptotic medium; 100 4M Pb**-acetate was either not adued or
added together with the apoptotic medium for 10 h or for various
intermediate times: 8, 6, 4 or 2 h. After 10 h of exposure to the apoptatic
medium, celis were stained with a mixture of fluorescein diacetate and
propidium iodide. The % of dead neurons is expressed as the mean =

Discussion

The United States Public Health Service has called lead
(Pb**) the most serious environmental hazard to young chil-
dren (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 1992; Ham-
mond and Dietrich, 1990). Despite reductions in exposure,
Pb** remains a danger to children, particularly in lower-
income urbanized areas, as highlighted by frequent alarming
reports from health authorities in different states. In 1984 an
estimated 3 million preschool-age children had high blood
Pb** levels (Hammond and Dietrich, 1990), and in 1993 the
American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that all chil-
dren under 6 years of age be tested for Pb'" poisoning
(American Academy of Pediatrics, 1998).

Despite the need for understanding the mechanisms of
Pb" * neurotoxicity, no comprehensive studies have yet es-.
tablished the reason for the high susceptibility of the devel.
oping CNS to Pb‘”. Here, in vitro aspects of in vivo Pb***
toxicity were replicated in primary cultures of cerebellar
granule neurons obtained from 6 to 8-day-old rat pups and
grown for 7 to 9 days (7-9 DIV). The cerebellar cultures are
an almost-pure population of granule neurons with less than
5% glial cell contamination (Nicoletti ef al., 1986), which
makes it possible to study Pb~* neurotoxicity in the absence
of the glial cell’s contribution to the process. Moreover, cere-
bellar granule neurons obtained from newborn rats are
highly susceptible to glutamate-induced necrosis (Favaron et
al., 1988; Manev et al., 1990; Schramm et a/., 1990), and they
represent the first well-established CNS neuronal model in
which apoptosis induced by drug, by toxin, and by lack of
nutrient and/or of depolarizing agent has been documented
(Gallo et al., 1987; Balazs et al., 1988; D’Mello e¢ al., 1993;
Galli et al., 1995; Marini and Paul, 1992; Yan et al., 1994).
Wood and colleagues (1993) have recently found an in vivo
correlate to the susceptibility of 7 to 9-DIV cerebellar granule
neurons to apoptosis, showing naturally occurring DNA frag-
mentation in the granule layer of newborn rat cerebella to be
limited to the period of 7 te 14 days after birth.

Ujihara and Albuquerque in 1992 demonstrated by using
the patch-clamp technique that Pb~* is a noncompetitive
antagonist of both NMDA and glycine receptors. The ability
of Ph** to block the NMDA-activated current in cultured
hippocampal neurons may explain the neuroprotective effect
of 50 to 100 uM Pb** on glutamate-induced necrosis ob-
served in cerebellar granule cells (fig. 1}. Our in vitro exper-
iment presented in figure 1 also shows that despite its neu-
roprotective effect on glutamate-induced necrosis, Pb** is
itself neurotoxic. Pretreatment of cerebellar granule cells
with cycloheximide or actinomycin D blocked Pb**-induced
cell death, pointing to apoptosis as a mechanism that may
account for Pb** neurotoxicity. To examine this possibility,
apoptosis was induced by exposing cultured cerebellar gran-
ule neurons to a nondepolarizing medium lacking FCS but
containing 5 4M dizocilpine to prevent Ca**-dependent ne-
crosis due to persistent glutamate receptor stimulation after
Pb**-induced glutamate release from the terminals of the
granule cell neurites (Gallo et a/., 1982). As figure 4A shows,
the process of neuronal death induced by the apoptotic cul-
ture conditions is slow; it takes several hours to became
apparent and days to be completed. Pb** dramatically po-
tentiated, in a dose-dependent manner, the neuronal death
induced by exposure of cerebellar granule cells to the apopto-
