tic medium conditions by shortening the time between appli-
cation of the apoptotic medium and the appearance of neu-
rotoxicity. That the neuronal death promoted by Pb** is of
the apoptotic type is suggested by 1) staining with the apop-
totic-specific dye Hoechst 33342, 2) the protection offered by
protein and RNA synthesis inhibitors and 3) internucleo-
somic cleavage of the DNA, as demonstrated by the specific
in situ labeling of DNA breaks in nuclei and on agarose gel
electrophoresis. The observation that the neurotoxicity of
Pb** becomes progressively weaker when this heavy metal
is added after a delay following the application of the apo-
ptotic medium (fig. 5) indicates that the Pb** effect is not the
result of activation of latent neurotoxic mechanisms but is
the result of de novo synthesis of RNA and proteins. These
conclusions are based on the fact that neuronal death was
promoted by Pbh** only for cells exposed simultaneously to
both Pb** and the apoptotic medium (fig. 5). These results
were obtained in a neuronal culture nearly free of glial cells.
This condition excludes the possibility that Ph** facilitates
neuronal apoptosis indirectly by primarily damaging glial
cells and thereby undermining their neurotrophic compe-
tence.

The plasma levels at which Pb** begins to affect children’s
CNS function are between 27 and 270 ug/100 2d, which is
equivalent to Pb** concentrations from 1.3 to 13 uM (Gold-
stein, 1992). Because plasma Pb** gains ready access to the
extracellular environment of nerve and glial cells, it is sug-
gested that the concentration of Pb** in the extracellular
space of the CNS is comparable to that of plasma (Bradbury
and Deane, 1993; Cory-Slechta, 1990). Thus, importantly, we

cilitated apoptotic death in cultured cerebellar granule neu-
rons from neonatal rats were within the range of those that
are associated with neurotoxic activity in the plasma of chil-
dren. The evidence that Pb** at low micromolar concentra-
tions facilitates apoptosis in neurons obtained from newborn
rat cerebella might help to explain the greater neurotoxic
action of Pb** during CNS development. The sensitivity to
Pb** toxicity of cultured granule neurons obtained from
newborn rat pups may support the hypothesis that Pb**
exerts its neurotoxic effects by facilitating the pathophysio-
logical process of suicidal death during neuronal selection in
CNS development, while excluding necrosis as a process op-
erative in Ph** neuratoxicity.

Pb* * is a divalent cation, and its neurotoxic action might
be related to its ability to substitute for Ca” ” and either to
inhibit or to increase the action of Ca** (Audesirk, 1993). In
several neuronal systems, decreased concentrations of free
cytosolic [Ca**],, induced by drugs that prevent Ca** influx
by blocking VSCC, can facilitate apoptosis (Franklin and
Johnson, 1992; Koh et al., 1995; Galli et al., 1995). Nimodip-
ine (a blocker of L-type VSCC) (Galli ef al., 1995; Koh et al.,
1995) added to high K*-containing medium elicited apoptosis
in cerebellar granule cells, and its action was blocked by Bay
K8644 (table 1), an agonist of the L-type VSCC (Hagiwara
and Byerly, 1981; Franklin and Johnson, 1992). Because it is
known that among the heavy metals, Pb** is the most potent
inhibitor of VSCC in vertebrate neurons competing with
Cat* in entering the cells (Audesirk, 1993), we performed
experiments aimed at establishing whether Pb~* reduces
[Ca**], in cerebellar granule cells. Using fura-2 single-cell
Ca*t* imaging (De Erausquin e¢ al., 1990; Kiedrowski and
Costa, 1995), we monitored changes in [Ca‘"]; after the
addition of Pbt* to the incubation medium. Although Pb**
elicited a decrease of fura-2 fluorescence by decreasing the
Fesa/Faga ratio, which suggests that it induces a decrease in
[Ca**],, methodological artifacts due to fura-2 fluorescence
quenching by Ph** cannot be excluded. In fact, in a cell-free
experiment, Pb'* quenched the fluorescence of fura-2 in
both Ca**-free and Ca**-saturated media. Reduction of ra-
dioactive Cat~ uptake into neurons, however, suggests that
Pb** reduces Ca** influx (Audesirk, 1993). These observa-
tions and the evidence presented here that Pb**-accelerated
