Pb** neurotoxicity durmg CNS growth and development, it
has not yet been established whether this neurotoxicity is
due to a facilitation of apoptosis and/or necrosis. To address
this question, we investigated the action of Pb*” in primary
cultures of cerebellar granule neurons obtained from 6- to
8-day-old rat pups (Vaccarino ef al., 1987). Previous studies
have demonstrated that cerebellar granule neurons in cul-
ture are a suitable model to evaluate the neurotoxicity during
an early postnatal period (Favaron et al., 1988; Maney, e¢ al.,
1990; D’Mello e¢ ai., 1993; Yan e¢ a/., 1995). Understanding
the mechanisms of Pb** neurotoxicity may provide the basis
for developing new therapeutic agents aimed at preventing
neuronal abnormalities during maturation.

Materials and Methods

Materials. Nunc tissue culture plastic dish and 15-mm glass
coverslips were purchased from Fisher (Pittsburgh, PA}. BME-cul-
ture media and FCS were purchased from GIBCO Laboratories
(Grand Island, NY); dizocilpine from RBI {Natick, MA); proteinase K,
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), RNase A and strept-
avidin-POD conjugate from Boehringer Mannheim (Indianapolis,
IN); aminoethylearbazole (AEC kit) from Vector Laboratory (Burlin-
game, CA); Bay K8644 from Miles Pharmaceuticals (West Haven,
CT). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

Granule cell cultures. Primary cultures of cerebellar granule
neurons were prepared from dissociated cerebella of 8-day-old Spra-
gue-Dawley rat pups as described previously (Vaccarine et al., 1987).
The cerebella were removed, chopped into 0.4-mm cubes and placed
into a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB: 120 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM
KCl, 1.2 mM KH,PO,, 25 mM NaHCO,, 14 mM glucose, 100 ye/ml
phenol red) that contained trypsin (93.5 U/ml) for 30 min at 37°C. The
trypsinization of the tissue was stopped by diluting (1:2) with the
KRB solution containing soy bean trypsin inhibitor (SBTD (83 pg/ml)
and deoxyribonuclease (120 kU/sn]). The cells were pelleted by cen-
trifugation, 200  g for 1 min, resuspended in 2 ml of KRB solution
with 5X concentrated SBTI plus deoxyribonuclease and then tritu-
rated 30 times with a Pasteur pipette. The large clumps of tissue
sedimented in the tube after 5 min and the supernatant were recov-
ered before the remaining clumps of tissue were triturated 30 times.
The combined supernatants containing cerebellar cells were cen-
trifuguted at 200 x g for 5 min and resuspended in BME supple-
mented with 10% FCS, 25 mM KCl, 2 mM glutamine and 100 pg/ml
gentamicin]. The cells were counted, and approximately 2.5 x 10°
cells were added to each 35-mm culture dish. Cells were maintained
at 37°C in a 95% air/5% CO, incubator, Ten micromolar cytosine-f-D
arabinofuranoside was added to the culture medium 18 to 22 h after
plating to prevent proliferation of gliul cells. These primary cultures
were shown by immunocytochemistry to contain >95% neurons and
about 3% glial cells. The neurons were identified by neurofilament
immunostaining and the glial cells by immunostaining with glial
fibrillary protein (Nicoletti e¢ al., 1986). After 8 days im vitro (8 DIV),
the cerebellar cultures were used for glutamate toxicity or serum
deprivation experiments as indicated below.

Exposure of granule cells to glutamate was performed as described
previously (Manev et al., 1991), Before application of glutamate, the
culture medium (culture-conditioned medium) was collected, and
cells were washed with Mg**-free Locke's solution (154 mM NaCl,
5.6 mM KCl, 3.6 mM NaHCOsg, 2.3 mM CaCly, 5.6 mM glucose and 10
mM HEPES, pH 7.4) containing LO »M glycine. The incubation with
glutamate in the buffer solution was terminated after 30 min at room
temperature by washing the monolayer with Locke’s buffer (contain-
ing 1 mM MgCl,) three times. The cells were returned to the culture-
conditioned medium and further incubated at 37°C, 95% air/5% CO,,
for 24 h. Pb** was added to the cells together with glutamate as a
50x Ph** acetate trihydrate, mH @ solution. Ph”~ was also added
to the conditioned medium after glutamate exposure.

Apoptosis was induced by exposure of 8-DIV cerebellar cultured
neurons to serum-free BME medium containing a physiological con-
centration of K* (8 mM) supplemented with glutamine, gentamicin,
and cytosine-8-D arabinofuranoside at the aforementioned concen-
tration and 5 pM dizocilpine. This medium will be referred to here as
apoptotic medium, Control cells were washed identically and main-
tained in the same medium supplemented with KC] at a final con-
centration of 25 mM.

Assays for cell survival. Neuronal cell death was assessed by
cell counts after intravital staining of the culture for 3 min at 22°C
with a mixture of fluorescein diacetate (15 yg/ml) and propidium
iodide (4.6 yg/ml). The stained cells were counted immediately at
200X magnification with a standard epi-illumination fluorescence
microscope as described by Favaron eé al. (1988). The same field was
counted simultaneously by two blind observers. Values that did not
differ by more than 10% were averaged and used for the final calcu-
lation. Cell counts for each experimental condition consisted of 4 to 6
fields per dish and 3 to 5 dishes per experiment.

Morphological evaluation. To detect nuclear condensation and
aggregation, cells were stained with the fluorescent dye Hoechst
38342 according to the method of Oberhammer et al. (1993). After
removing the medium, the neurons were washed once with cold PBS
(pH 7.2) and fixed for 10 min in 4% formaldehyde in PBS at 4°C,
washed with distilled water, dehydrated in graded alcohols and kept
at —20°C until used. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (5
ve/ml in 1% DMSO) for 5 min, washed, dried and analyzed under UV
light microscopy.

DNA fragmentation assay. DNA nick end labeling of cells: Cer-
ebellar granule neurons were plated on 13-mm glass coverslips pre-
viously coated with 10 jg/ml poly-(L-lysine) and placed in a 24-
multiwell dish. Cells (8 DIV) were fixed for 10 min with 4%
formaldehyde in PBS at 4°C and stained with the method of in situ
end labeling of DNA fragments based on the TUNEL technique
(Gavrieli e¢ af., 1992). Briefly, after a 5-min treatment with protein-
ase K (20 yg/ml) to dissociate proteins from DNA, coverslips were
incubated with terminal deoxynuelcotidyl transferase (0.3 U/l) and
biotin dUTP (40 4M) for 2h. Cells were covered with strept-avidin-
POD conjugate diluted 1:200 in water, and the reaction product was
visualized using aminoethylearbazole (AEC kit) as a substrate,
which made conventional histochemical identification by light mi-
croscopy possible. Negative controls did not include the enzyme or
the nucleotides; in positive controls, coverslips were incubated with
DNase (1 pg/ml) before the terminal transferase.

DNA extraction and electrophoresis: Soluble apoptotic DNA frag-
ments were isolated and agarose gel electrophoresed as described by
Herrmann et al. (1994). After harvesting, the cell samples were
washed with PBS and pelleted by centrifugation. The cell pellets
were then treated for 10 s with lysis buffer (1 NP-40 in 20 mM EDTA,
50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 10 ul per 10° cells, minimum 50 yl). After
centrifugation for 5 min at 1600 X g, the supernatant was collected
and the extraction was repeated with the same amount of lysis
buffer. The supernatants were brought to 2% w/v SDS and lreated
for 1 h with RNase A (final concentration 2.5 ug/yl) at 54°C, followed
by digestion with proteinase K (final concentration 2.5 g/l) for Lh
at 37°C. After the addition of 1/10 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate, the
DNA was precipitated (at —20°C for 20 min) with 2.5 volumes of
100% ethanol, dissolved in gel loading buffer and separated by elec-
trophoresis in 1% agarose gel.

Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean + S.E.M.
Statistical comparisons were made using analysis of variance fol-
lowed by Duncan’s mltiple range test using the computer-assisted
program of Tallarida an’ Murray (1987).
