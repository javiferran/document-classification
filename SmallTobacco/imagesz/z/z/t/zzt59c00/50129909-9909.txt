Dear Dr. Lisanti:

{ am wttting to you concerning the feasibility study of
d=Nicotine and gamma~pyridy1-J-oxobutyric acid CPOBA), Some problems
have arisen concerning the aviailability of some chemicals that ‘we
need to complete the study and we would Tike to ask to extend the study
through July Ist. We have found that racemization occurs at the
elevated temperature (250°C) and pressure as indicated in our previous
report. [t fs now clear that the yield obtained by this approach is
very Jow and would be of the order of &-5% which makes the method
impractical for preparing larze amounts of d-Nicotine. We are there-
fore evaluating lower temperature (e.g. 170°C). The chemical synthesis
of racemic nicotine looks promising and may be the best solutton. How-
ever, until the backordered chemicals arrive we will not be able to
complete the study. [t appears that we have liquidated the world's
supply of cyclopropylbromide!!

We have investigated the McKennis synthesis method of POBA
and are not at all happy with the procedure or the yield. As an
alternative we are looking at the reaction of 3-pyridylmagnestumbromide
with succinic anhydride as a possible one-step synthesis. Results of
these studies will be discussed tn our next report.

Sincerely,
