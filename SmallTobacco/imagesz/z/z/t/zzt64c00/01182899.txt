WASHINGTON, June 11—A
$25,000,000 five-year study of :
“community air pollution" was;
Proposed today by an interde-
partmentat Federal committee
created last December.

The President had asked Mrs,.
Oveta Culp Hobby, Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare.
to set up the committee after a’
group of California Congress-
men had come to him with their:
smog troubles.

The proposed $25,000,000
atudy would be much broader in.
scope than one proposed in the
bill for 2 $3,000,000 study, spon-
sored by Senator Thomas H.|
Kuchel, Republican of California. |
This bill hag passed the Senate:
and now is pending in the House j
of Representatives. :

Closer to this plan is the smog
bill sponsored by Senator Homer,
E. Capehart, Republican of In-;
diana, which set no ceiling on:
appropriations for a broad-scale
air pollution study. This bill also
has passed the Senate, as a rider
on the housing bill, .

House bills calling for Federal
air pollution studies are spon-
sored by John H, Ray, Repubti-.
can of Staten Island, New York, -

sey industrial flats; by Repre-.

and James Roosevelt, Democrat,:

The Interdepartmental Com-:
mittee on Community Air Pol
lution included representatives. of ;
the Public Health Service of Mrs.:
Hobby’s department; the Bureau.
of Mines of the Interior Depart-
ment; the Bureau of Standards/
and the Weather Bureau of the!
Department of Commerce; the:
Agricultural Research Service of
the Department of Agriculture:
the Office of Navy Research, De-
partment of Defense; the Na-
tional Science Foundation and
the Atomic Energy Commission.
Surgeon Generali Leonard A.

Service served as chairman. Five

Permanent Group Urged

The committee recommended
that the proposed anti-pollution
program be administered by the

partment of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare with the
assistance of 2 permanent inter-
departmental committee repre-
senting the departments and
agencies that participated in the
ad hoe deliberations.

It defined “community air pol-
lution,” a term coined in distine-
tion to industrial-site air pollu.
tion and atomic fall-out as:
“The presence in the ambient
atmosphere of substances put
there by the activities of man in
concentrations sufficient to in-
terfere directly or indirectly
with his comfort, ‘safety or
health, or with full use and en-
Joyment of his property.”

The report specifically stated:
“In general, it does not refer to
the atmospheric pollution inci-
dent to employment in areas
where workers are employed,
nor is it concerned with airborne
agents of communicable disease,
nor with overt or coverts acts
of war.”

The responsibilities of the
states and localities and of the
Federa? Government in coping
with this modern problem atso
were defined by the committee.

Regulatory control of com-
munity air pollution, its report
stated, is the province of state
and local governments, except
with regard to radioactive air
pollution resulting from opera-
tions directly controlled by the
Federal Government or inter-,
State and international air pol-
lution,

However, the report also}
stated, the Federal Government
should provide supplementary

lems or situations beyond their|

The Assistant Surgeon Gen-
eral, Mark Hollis, chief of the
Division of Sanitary Engineer-
ing Services, said that the Pub-!
lic Health Service already has!
air pollution experts at work in|
Los Angeles. He added that Dr.
Arthur “Stern would be gent;
from the Cincinnati laboratories,
to aid in the two-state Survey
for which New York and New
Jersey have each’ put up $30,000
