RE: PM Blues

In response to your question concerning the PM Blues analysis, the fol-
lowing additional information is provided:

® The 10% processed stems level in PM Blues is
higher than any other PM product analyzed.
PM stems are puffed all flue-cured stems.
A normal PM product has 3=-5%.

® PM Blues also uses no dark G-7, which is
produced on a steel belt, versus the light
sheet, which is produced on a felt belt.
All other PM products analyzed have both
light and dark reconstituted sheet.

An analysis of PM's Private Label brands were previously completed and
indicated the presence of light and dark reconstituted sheet. Also, there is
a low % of processed stems in the Private Label brands, .

If I ean be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to call.

Thank you,

Gloria C. Eskridge
