Dear Mr. Keniston: -- - - _-

Thank you very much for your letter concerning our FACT advertising.
We realize that the proper grammatical construction is "I smoke only

.. FACTS" but feel that it does not portray the proper conviction that

our copy line conveys. In order to personalize the choice of brand

to the model being presented in the ad, we have chosen the line “I'm
realistic" and "I only smoke FACTS," Coe be Fs
Since the subject of the advertisement i is FACT cigarettes and only
FACT cigarettes, it goes well beyond the connotation of the ad to imply
that the only thing the model does is enjoy our brand of cigarettes.
Our marketing research indicates that consumers reading this adver-
tisement appear to receive exactly the intended connotation in the
communication - that is, that the model portrayed has made an
informed judgment on his brand of cigarettes and has chosen "to
smoke only FACTS." Our feeling is that the American public has
come to understand over the years that advertisements typically
assume "poetic license" in order to convey their selling messages
and further feel that they can make a dichotomy between advertising
use of language and the exactly proper grammatical construction.

Again, thank you for your letter and we hope that, if you are a smoker,
you will try cur FACTS and see if you do not agree that they deliver
atypically good taste for a low 'tar' cigarette.

Sincerely,

feos i a
