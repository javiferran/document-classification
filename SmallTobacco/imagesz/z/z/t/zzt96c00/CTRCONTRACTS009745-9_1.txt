particles adhere to each other the particle size distribution would be
changed. Although it may not be a significant problem the potential
also exists for a particle size separation since the smaller

particles will reach a higher final velocity then the larger particles,
as the smoke is accelerated through the capillary tunnel. Using a
larger diameter tunnel, and diluting directly behind the cigarettes
may be worth consideration.

Based upon the criteria outline by the S.A.B. for a low cost and simple
machine design to be used by small labs, I feel that the Walton-
Morrissey machine demonstrated at the meeting is superior to any similar
machine previously evaluated at Mason Laboratories. Dr. Rosenkrantz's
technique of calibrating the rotameter settings versus TPM delivery is
an excellent method for establishing correct machine operation. One
might consider carrying this a step further and calibrate TPM delivery
against TPM values from standard analytical smoking machines. This
method could serve as a reference point for any lab using the Walton
machine.

John, it was a pleasure to have an opportunity to assess the current
machine modifications and I hope my comments on the machine will have

some constructive value.

With best regards,
