‘The smoking apparatus employed was essentially stenderdy
the puff rete wes 2.5 se0,,puff every 2245 seo,. or a 2.5
puff followed by a 20 sec. lapse.

The Lemperatures observed during the smoking process--1oW. of. 68000)"
high of 800°, average of 742%--are in agreement with temperature!

reported previously by Wy nder, Graham and Croningsr (CANCER RESEARGH
13, 855(1953)) and by Cooper, i ndsey and Waller (BRIT. MED
Nov. 18, 1964; CHEM. & IND.,2954, 1418).

The quantity of tar obteined represented 5-t0 10% of the’ Weight’ or.
a standard ] gm. cigarette. According to k¥xAK Schmahl, Co nsbruch >. *
end Druckrey (ARZNEIMITWEI-FORSCH., 4, 71(1984)) 98% of: the ‘ter
inhaled is absoebed by the smoker. Seolkopf oaloulates that: 6
‘smoking 30 ciparettes per dey for 20 years would absorb from ‘
365, x £0 x 10 x 0.05 x 0.9&/3000 to “365 x 20 x 10 x 0.10 x 0. 98/1009".

or 3.6 to 7, 2 kem. ter.in 20 years.

The tar was fractionatdd into acidic, basic end neutral frectiones wa
The neutral fraction represented 37, Be of the total tar,
bistillation of this neutral fraction at reduced pressure gave.”
10 fractions boili_g from 70%/ 3 mm. to 290C/5 mm, and et a
-residue of 9.8% of the Lote. Weight. of the. “tar. .

Chromatographic analysis of these verious frections indicated. the |
presence of naphthalene (noncarcinogenic), anthracene (noncarcdno- _ .
genic) and $,4-benzpyrene (carcinogenic). : vo

The author estimates that 100 em. of cigarette tar contains 50 gene
(estimated spectrophotometrically) of 3,4-benzpyrene.
Cooper, lindsey and Waller (see above reference) estimate that

& person smoking 40 cigarettes per day would absorb 150 gamma of
3,4-benzpyrene per year Whereas a calculation using Secikopfts date
indiostes thet a person smoking 10 cigarettes per day would
absorb S65 x 10 x 0.05 x 0.98 x S0/100 LO ‘3.85 X 10 x 0.10 x 0:98 -x
50/100 or 90 to 180 gamma of 3 ,4-benzpyrene per year.

Jt is interesting to note that the investigators (Cooper et al, sce

CANCER RESEARCH, ABSTRACTS, 46th sANN. whEVING, apr. 15-7(1955), .

or so have reported the presence of 5,4-benzpyrese whereas the invest--
