Subject: Ment on Color Foil

Joyce - We are conducting a feasibility study to develop specifications for mentholated foil. Here is the objective:

e¢ Develop menthol on foil specifications (Gc Test: mg/150 mm) for all of the PM Material Codes for the seven base
sheet foil products (19% Gold - 51.8 g/m’), (19H Green - 51.8 g/m’), (198 Silver - 50.1 g/m”), (19# Silver - 50.5 g/m?),

(19# Silver - 51.8 gim?), (25# Gold - 61.6 g/m”), & (30# Silver - 68.4 g/m”)] by conducting process capability analysis
using the Cpk 1.5 methodology approach developed by The Specification Development Team in 1998.

e« Develop menthol on foil specification limits by the methodology specified above, and verify that the cigarette
subjectives and analyticals (menthol delivery) at these specification limits are acceptable.
Now, we have to know if we should develop specs for menthol application on color foils.

Please fill me in.
Thanks
