INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE
RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

~

The cigarettes for the prescribed tests are to be taken.
from 10 cartons. The three experimental cigarettes will be
taken from 10 cartons out of cold storage, and cigarettes coded
#872F manufactured October 16, 1962 will be fresh cigarettes.

‘Competitive brand cigarettes will be obtained from the
10 jobbers supplying the C. I. Samples, one carton from each
obber. These cigarettes already are at the Research Center
(oorived this week).
- Dr. Seligman informed' me that 20 cartons of new 872F
cigarettes will be sent to the Center this week. He does not
believe cigarettes coded 854A (new extremely high porosity
paper) will be ready this week.

Therefore, we plan to ship the cigarettes to U. S. Testing
for the T.P.M., nicotine and total R.T.D. analysis as soon as
code 872F arrives at the Center. One pack from each of the
ten cartons will be sent to U. S. Testing.

Cigarettes for exit temperature, phenol, furfural,
humectant and moisture in filter will be taken from the same
10 carton sample. Where the data is not available, analysis
will be carried out at the Research Center. Experimental work
will start immediately. It is estimated that all the analyses

unforseen delays arise.
