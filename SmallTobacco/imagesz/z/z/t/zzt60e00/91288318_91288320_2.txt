As discussed, I'd like to get one or two executions to illustrate
this positioning for next Wednesday's meeting. (Please reassure

Alan that these will not be final. In fact if he didn't properly
4 want to do further development, we'd have to demand it.)

2. I'd like to modify the present advertising to consumer
promotion ratio from 70/30 to 60/40. Again, of course so we

can heavily sample our surprising good taste. As you're redoing
the out-of-home production figures please think about this. I¢
possible I'd like you to also do this for next Wednesday's meet-
ing. (You don't need to mess with monthly shipment patterns

for next Wednesday. Ben is checking that out and will get
back to you.)

 

3. We are banking a lot on the surprising good taste of low
tar Carolina 30's. Bill and Mary Anne will be looking hard

to make product test parallels that will confirm this. How-
ever let's keep open to the idea of blind product (blindfold ?)
testing Carolina 30's vs. KGL to confirm this superiority.

I'd-be glad to discuss any of this further.
