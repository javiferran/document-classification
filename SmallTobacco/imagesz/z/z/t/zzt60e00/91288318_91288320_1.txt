What Doesn't Help - 1. Skinny shape (extra-slimness) triggers
strongly negative product expectations; weak taste, hard draw,
fast burn. Further, physical configuration didn't work as a
reason-why. For low tar/good taste it was confusing or pseudo-
scientific; For thirty cigarettes it was unnecessary. We
shouldn't hide our configuration. But we sure shouldn't make

a big deal out of it.

2. Scientific explanations (diagrams) are confusing and
irritating. This probably contributes to weak taste expec-
tations. And since our tar level will be 13 mg. it probably
overstates our case.

3. Premium price per pack will be a significant problem.
While I was pleasantly surprised that this wasn't more of

a negative to more women in yesterday's sessions - we know
it will be a real deterent to use. (As you know, T believe
the idea of a money b arantee "if you're not surprised
by the taste" is Major step forward. This obviously needs
development and investigation.)

4. Convenience of not running out is surely a situation to
which most smokers can quickly and strongly relate; as we
particularly saw with the camping execution. However it

isn't a necessary reason-why, since other 30's-ariented
executions also trigger enthusiasm. And it is a complex,
additional thought. we ne é

Near Term Next Steps

Ll. All of this comes together in a pretty good initial
positioning statement:

New Carolina 30's gives smokers 10 extra,
good tasting, low tar cigarettes per pack.
It costs a little more so there's a money
back guarantee if smokers aren t pleasantly
surprised by the taste.

We will of course work with the exact balance between 10
extra and good taste/low tar. And we'll work with the
guarantee.
