MEMORANDUM
May 13, 1977

TO: Mr. Jon Greenleaf

FROM: Dick Smith

- SUBJECT: Carolina 30's Positioning

This will summarize some thoughts coming out of yesterday'sâ€™
sessions, and near term next steps,

These excellent focus groups will undoubtedly give us further
important direction. However, the major benefit for me was
their overall positioning guidance - what to communicate and
(especially) what not to communicate.

We are moving very, very fast. And as we move forward over
the next several months we will all stay open to modifying
these early positioning thoughts. However, for now this
positioning gives us the necessary focus against which to
make changes.

Positioning Thoughts

What Helps - 1. Every group has voiced surprise, "shock"
at how good the product tastes. Of course we'll make final
determinations and modifications based on product testing.
But this reaction is sure nice to see.

2. Thirty cigarettes (10 extra, pack and a half) is very
positive to many respondents. - While taste is important
("ten extra what"), this added quantity is our uniqueness,
and will be very important to trial.

3. Good taste and low tar is an important, unsatisfied
need for many smokers. Relative to Carolina 30's, we
particularly saw this in the second session yesterday.

QTESECTS

4. Although not explicitly probed, the brand name
Carolina 30's seems to work well. I believe it brings
assurance, credibility and good taste overtones to this
new brand.
