Dear Or, Crane:

My attention has been called te your syndicated olen
under the headline, â€œCigaret Smoke Can Ruin Blood
in which you state that carbon monexide permanently destroya. nd
bleed cells, If this ie pm caaee it da, of course, of great
practical importance and I would appreciate it very * wich if you
could refer ne to the source of any evidence supporting your
eoant.

It is, of course, veld known thet carbon monazide hae
a strong affinity for heaeglebia and displaces oxygen frem exy~
in, However, according te current texts and other medical
writings thig is a reversible reaction. The amount of carbon

hy
propartien of oeycee ce ceeent in tine in the environment. This
ia the basia for the use of oxygen in treating carbon monoxide

poisoning; thua prometing the rapid elimination of carben monoxide
and speeding recovery.

Any sofentific references you can send me which will
suppert your peaition would be meet weloone,

Sincerely yours,
