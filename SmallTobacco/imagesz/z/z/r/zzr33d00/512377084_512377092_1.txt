a. CORESTA Task Force:

.CORESTA Cover Plate: .

A mechanical drawing of a mockup cover plate designed by
the Japan Tobacco Inc. was submitted to Mitch Shore of
the machine shop (Figure II). Fifty cover plates were
produced for task force members. Implementation of the
cover plate will eliminate the need for pinning the
fabric to the polyurethane foam block. Also, fabric can
be cut to 3 inch widths, resulting in a significant
materials savings.

Horizontal/Vertical Smolder Testing:

RJR and American Tobacco Co. conducted a study on the
effect of smolder angle during free smolder. Cigarettes
529 (FELC~25) and 530 (FELN-25), two angles (0° & ~90°),
and three treatment levels (2000, 2400, and 3200 ppm K*)
were used for this evaluation. The cigarettes were lit
with a 35cc/2sec puff and allowed to smolder horizontally
or vertically for 15mm. The horizontal free smolder was
conducted outside the box as in previous CORESTA studies,
and the vertical inside the box as prescribed by NIST for
the round-robin. Ten replicates were run on each
treatment for each cigarette and smolder angle, for a
