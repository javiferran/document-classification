TBN has been put on a list of candidates to take two
courses given by Dr. Ray’ Myers from VPI, sometime this
fall. One course involves experimental design and the
second regression analysis methods. Both courses would
complement the Introductory Statistics course (see b.)
that TBN took in June.

b. Learn how to perform common statistical analyses.

TBN attended an Introductory Statistics course given by
Dr. Ray Myers from VPI on June 8-10. Topics of
discussion included:

. Two sample t-tests

. One factor analysis of variance '

. Two factor analysis of variance
with interaction

. Two level factorial designs

TBN found Dr. Myers to be an excellent instructor. The
course was easy to follow and has‘ laid a strong base for
what TBN hopes will be a continuous education of
statistical methodologies.
