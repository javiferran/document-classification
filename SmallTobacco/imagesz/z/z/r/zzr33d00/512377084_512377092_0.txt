1. Evaluate the effects of air flow and’ oxygen concentration on
ignition propensity.
”
a. Develop an enclosure and evaluate effects of air
flow. (2Q).,

Due to a change in priorities, work’ involving the
"Localized Air Flow" apparatus*was delayed until late
June. Currently, cigarettes G and J are being used to
determine the appropriate levels of Kt on California
standard fabric. Once the fabrics have been chosen, an «
experiment willbe conducted using air flows of 0, 2.5,
5.0, 10.0 cm/sec.

b. Complete evaluation of O, effects at constant flow
rate and flow effects at constant 0, on "Flow-
Through" method with selected TSG cigarettes. (2Q)

The objective of this study was to determine whether the
"Flow-Through" method could discriminate between selected

_ "remake" TSG cigarettes. Cigarettes 506 (BELN-21), 529
(FELC-25), 525 (FNLC+25), and 528 (FNHN-25) were selected
for testing. These cigarettes represent a wide range of
ignition propensities as reported by the TSG.

Ignition test results of cigarettes 506, 529, 525, and
528 on UFAC type II fabric at various air flow rates are
shown in Table I. Ten replicates were run at each point
and are represented by a percent ignition in the table
(i.e. #/10). A well-defined differentiation between
cigarettes was not observed. This can be seen in
Figure I, a plot of percent ignitions versus air flow
rate for all cigarettes. A formal analysis of variance
has not been performed on the data; however, one could
generalize that the cigarettes performed similarly at low
flow rates, and cigarettes 525 and 528 produced more
ignitions then 506 and 529 at the higher flow rates.

The results do not indicate a wide range of ignition
propensities as reported by the TSG. Because of this,
work involving various 0, percent has been postponed.
