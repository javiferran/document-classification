McLane Inventory Analysis

Objective:

Recommend to McLane a plan for achieving 60/65 inventory turns in 1997
accounting for promotions, overstocks and other pre-defined parameters. Then
indicate the resulting impact on customer service level(CSL) if less the 99.9%. If
60/65 turns does not allow 99.9% CSL, recommend the appropriate number of turns
that will achieve this CSL.

Information Required:

AIM weekly sales from McLane to refail.
CRP daily inventory and sales.

Promotion information.

Shop calendar - RJR and McLane.
Forecasting Methodology.

Ordering rules and operational procedures.

Approach:

Develop a computer simulation that will model product flow from RJR’s public
warehouse through each of the McLane divisions. This requires a detailed
understanding of the product flow process from forecasting through delivery to retail.
Meeting will have to be scheduled with BIAD to understand the forecasting process,
Distribution to understand the ordering rules and trips scheduled to a number of
McLane divisions to understand their operational procedures.

Benefits:

¢ This model could be used to address inventory turn and customer service level
requirements for other direct accounts.

¢ This will enable RJR to enhance our working relationship with McLane.
¢ Knowledge learned from the model could reduce forecasting error, therefore

reducing safety stock at the public warehouses and smoothing out the production
schedule.
