McLane Inventory Analysis

McLane has asked Distribution to assist them in developing an inventory plan of
RJR product in their warehouses for 1997. Operations Planning had done some
work earlier in the year with Distribution to look at the feasibility of achieving 60 turns
of inventory. In assisting Distribution in this latest effort, we will build on what we
have already done. Attached is a description of our work plan which will be
presented to McLane in October.

1997 Overtime Analysis

An analysis was done looking at the potential capacity constrained overtime for
1997. The analysis used a base case sales forecast of 152.9 and an upside
forecast of 157.2 billion cigarettes. The result of the analysis indicated that the
capacity constrained overtime could range from 1.1 to 3.1 billion cigarettes.
