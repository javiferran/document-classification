Rationale for new approach: changing
company, changing marketing environment,
emergence of new groups and
organizations, need to produce greater
synergy among departments within RJRT and
among RJRN companies, need to achieve
greater return for financial investment

-- Contributions (Current sources:
Corporate Contributions, Corporate
Affairs, Field Marketing Managers, Sales,
etc. Create synergies by working more
closely with other departments/companies
to eliminate or reduce expenditures
that can no longer be justified.)

-- Programs (Examples of specific
programs we support: NNPA Journalism
Scholarship, Project Excel, Success
Academy, CBCF Fellows Program, etc.
Identify grassroots/comnunity-based
programs that provide a better "fit" with
current Company structure and re-examine
future participation in ongoing
programs.)
