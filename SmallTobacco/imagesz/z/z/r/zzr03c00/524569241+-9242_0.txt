SUBJECT: MODIFICATION TO ADD A FAS UNIT TO A PROTOS 80 MAKER
MAKING AND PACKING DEPT., BUILDING 601-1, WHITAKER PARK
PTC/PTO #00424R8

Dear Mr. Abrams:

Thank you for advising the Department of your plans to add a FAS unit to one of the makers
which allows the addition of natural menthol, at the maker, instead of the standard process of
adding menthol to tobacco product in the top dressing drums in the Casing and Cutting
Department at Tobaccoville.

As presented in your August 5, 1997 letter, the Department approves the installation and
operation of a FAS unit at Building 601-1, Whitaker Park. RIRT may proceed with the
installation and operation of the FAS unit as permitting is not triggered by this modification.

For this modification, the Department accepts the assumption VOC emissions by direct
application of natural menthol at a maker will not significantly affect the current emission factor
used for this process. However, in the future, should additional FAS units be planned, including
menthol application to other brands, we would request certification of VOC emissions by use of
appropriate data which may include emissions stack testing. This certification would then be
used to validate the assumption of no increase to VOC emissions by addition of natural menthol
(FAS unit) at a maker in lieu of processing Tobaccoville Casing and Cutting mentholated
product.
