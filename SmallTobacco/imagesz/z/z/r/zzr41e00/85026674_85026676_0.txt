MEMORANDUM
August 6, 1976
- CONFIDENTIAL -
TO: Mr. d. R. Ave
FROM: R. E. Smith
RE: August, 1976 Status Report

Here's how the major work stands.
NEW BRAND DEVELOPMENT

SHF/UHF - Top-line results from quantitative concept evaluation
indicate that "50% lower nicotine" has strong potential. We

are starting product and advertising development on this concept.
This, along with business/marketing planning, is aimed toward

a 1/77 test market. We plan to select 3 or 4 more concepts

from analysis of the complete data (including - for sure - one
menthol SHF concept) during the week of 8/23.

Nowland's first report on their basic work with health-concerned
smokers will be made in late August. Their work will be com-
pleted in late 1976. We plan to select from Nowland ideas and
high technology concepts - and go to in-market evaluation in
mid-1977 and beyond.

Perceived Economy - Twelve concepts are being produced for
quantitative evaluation. Top-line results will be available

in early October. We plan to be in-market with low technology
products during the first quarter of 1977.

Synectics II - Work is proceeding on major projects:

- MRD will shortly recommend how we can best
identify (quantify) high-potential cigarette
smoking segments; who, why, how many. This
is likely to be a long-range study - but we
will separate it into Manageable, specific
building steps.

- Following discussions with R&D/Operations,
MCA will lay out a specific procedure for
adding projects to the 5 Year Plan. This
procedure will be an expansion of a system
that has been established in Greensboro for
some time, se

Both these projects will be ready for your review in late
August. ~~
