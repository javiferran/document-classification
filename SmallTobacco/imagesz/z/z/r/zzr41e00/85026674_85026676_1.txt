August, 1976 Status Report
8/6/76

Also we are working on improved flavors/sensations, social
acceptability, chewing tobaccos and delivery systems; on a
lower priority basis.

NEWPORT

The Newport 1975 Sales Budget of 6,225MM units continues to
look secure - especially given the strong consumer promotions
that will run during the August-December period.

Other key projects - media weight test, alternative copy de-
velopment, product evaluation, Lights development /evaluation
and the reintroduction - are running well; as described in
Joe's Status Report, attached to your copy only.

ocr
We continue to believe that OGF will ship 3.8B units in 1976;
5% behind budget and 10% below 1975. To reach this sales
level we will have to reduce the percentage loss trend vs.
year-ago. (The brand was 11.4% behind year-ago at the end

of July; and this rate of decline has been increasing through-
out 1976.)

The strong Fall/Winter promotion program (direct mail coupons,
2 packs free and tests) is the reason we believe OGF's rate
of decline will improve. During the last third of the year
OGF consumer promotion will be close half a million dollars;
almost twice what was spent during the first 8 months of 1976.

Other major programs such as copy development, the spending
test, Lights evaluation and continuing administrative demands
are discussed in Walter's Status Report; attached to your copy
only.

OVERALL

1. Newport, OGF and New Brands can all operate effectively
within the recently adjusted dollar budgets.

e. Brand Reviews for 9/3 are moving forward. We will include
Switching Study analysis/conclusions if the data is avail-
able.
