SUBJECT: Project CC Brand Development Plan
TO: Mr. J. D. Phillips

The following Action Plan was developed in response to
recent NFO data that indicated CC Prototypes were deficient
when compared to Merit without concept.

I. Tar Variations ~

New Brand Marketing agreed to open up the tar restraint
of current 8 mg to within the FFLT category. Three ‘tar'
categories will be investigated in order to determine the
effect 'tar' has on perception of CC taste, they are 5, 10,
and 15 mg 'tar'. ‘

II. Pressure Drop of Cigarette 2

The current CC products were developed at approximately
120mm draft. In previous testing it was determined that in-
creasing the pressure dropped produced a smoother and milder
taste. Two additional drafts at 140mm and 150-160mm will be
investigated.

III, Blend Variations >

Previous testing with increased turkish tobacco indicated
that an improvement may be made in taste with further increases.
Blends with 20% and 30% turkish tobacco and also elimination
of G7 will be investigated.
IV. Flavor Modifications %

Flavor R&D will provide Brand R&D with three flavor systems
in an attempt to modify the sidestream aroma and taste.
