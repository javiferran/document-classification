Vv. Development of 100mm CC prototypes

Generally 100mm styles are perceived as being milder and
smoother products than the 85mm styles. Therefore, development
of a 100mm CC product may provide the same benefit. Current
blend and flavor will be utilized and tar will be varied from
â€œ6-14 mg. Merit 100 will be used as control product.

A meeting was held with the Sensory Evaluation Division
to design testing procedures to evaluate the CC prototypes.
The week of 10/1/82 testing will be done on the following
prototypes to establish a base line for comparing all future
products: : :

A) Current CC blend with conventional paper
B) Current CC prototypes (NFO Wave I and II B)
C) Merit 85

Tests are being written this week to be made as soon as
possible. Revised products should be available for testing the
week of 10/8/82 with results the week of 10/22/82. Based on
the results of the non-menthol Diagnostic. Descriptive Panel
tests, it is anticipated to proceed to NFO/EUT in January,
1983. Depending on the number of cells requested for NFO,
the test market DTS would be delayed 'til September or
October 1983,

All tests of CC products will be done on the non-menthol
style products with translation to the menthol products.

If there are further questions, please call.
