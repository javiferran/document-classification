Comparison of death certificates with clini-
cal and autopsy records has led to the con-
clusion that mortality statistics on cause of
death are of dubious accuracy.

In 1973, the frequency of lung cancer in each’
county in the United States was reported by
the Epidemiology Branch of the National

Cancer Institute. These data are now used

for our vital statistics, but I wonder how
reliable such data can be if based on the
kinds of death certificates that I have found,

At first it might seem surprising that the cause of

death listed on a death certificate may not be accurate. How-
ever, a closer look at how death certificate information is

obtained reveals that errors can occur, chiefly from misdiag-

nosis and recording mistakes.

The physician's diagnosis of the patient's fatal
disease, usually found in the clinical or hospital record,
often serves as the basis for the cause of death listed on the
death certificate. * Thus, the information entered on the
death certificate will be inaccurate if the physician has
failed to diagnose the patient's disease accurately and the

error is not corrected on the basis of laboratory or autopsy

results.

* The internationally accepted death certificate form requires
that a physician indicate (a) the immediate cause of death,
(b) the condition which led to the immediate cause of death
and (c) the underlying disease or condition which led to the
conditions listed in (a) and (b). It is the

underlyin
cause of death (c) that is then coded and compiléd and

eventually reflected in national and international mortality
statistics.
