All mortality statistics, including those for cancer of
specific sites, may be affected by errors made in the coding
of the underlying cause of death listed on the death certifi-
cate.” For example, when more than one cancer site is men-
tioned on the death certificate, coding of the underlying |
cause has always been difficult.!> rt is also confusing
when the word "metastatic" appears, because this word is used
ambiguously, sometimes to designate a primary site from which

the cancer has spread, and sometimes to designate a site to

which cancer has spread, l>

Lung Cancer Mortality Data

Of the cancer sites, the lung frequently has received
special attention from investigators interested in questions
of diagnostic accuracy. Their research findings, while dif-
ferent in some respects, have been consistent on one point:

The rate of misdiagnosis of lung cancer has been high. yet

* Death certificates are collected by offices of vital
statistics in each state and country and the information is
"translated" into an internationally established code
number denoting the "underlying cause of death." The code
numbers and corresponding diseases are listed in the
International Classification of Diseases. State, national
and international mortality data for specific diseases are
compiled using the coded death certificates.
