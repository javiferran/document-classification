combination of the two (cancer clinically diagnosed but as-

Signed to the wrong primary site).

The view of one researcher that "there are many
pitfalls in the radiologic and biopsy diagnosis of cancer,
particularly, with regard to site of origin"® is well
Supported. A study of 1,000 consecutive autopsies at a New
York City hospital concluded that "a considerable number of
neoplasms were found at autopsy in which the site of origin
had not been established during life."? For pancreatic
cancer, 48 percent of the cases found at autopsy had not been

Clinically diagnosed.

In a study at Boston City Hospital, "incorrect clinical
diagnoses of cancer appeared in 40 percent (1,094) of the
2,734 cancer patients,"20 These errors involved either

undiagnosed cancer or diagnosis of the wrong primary site.

Reports of cancer misdiagnosis have not been limited to
the U.S. Finnish researchers found in an autopsy series of
cancer patients that the clinically assigned site of the
primary tumor was incorrect in 20 percent of the cases.”
Results of a Scottish study indicated that for the more common
sites of cancer, there was agreement between autopsy findings

and clinical diagnosis in less than half of the 327 cases.
