by a research team led by National Cancer Institute scien-
tists.â€™ They compared the cause of death listed on the
death certificate with what they considered to be the "best
estimation of the true cause of death" -- the cause "assigned
by a physician based on autopsy findings in combination with

pertinent clinical data." Disagreement was found in 42

percent of their 257 cases.

The scientists also considered the "cancellation ef-
fect" -- that losses and gains for a specific cause of death,
caused by misdiagnoses or recording errors, might cancel each

other out, resulting in valid overall reporting of mortality

statistics.

This possibility was rejected by the researchers, who
concluded that their study "affirms the need to assess the

reliability of U.S. mortality statistics."/

Cancer Mortality Data

When researchers compare medical records and autopsy
reports for cancer of specific sites, they often find high
rates of clinical "misdiagnosis." In this context misdiag-
nosis means underdiagnosis (cancer not detected by the
attending physician but found at autopsy), overdiagnosis

(cancer clinically diagnosed but not found at autopsy) or a
