clinical diagnosis of cancer were unconfirmed at autopsy. It
also was noted that misdiagnosis rates did not occur with
equal frequency within subgroups of the population but varied
with the patient's ethnic origin, age and days hospitalized.

These considerations led the authors to caution:

Our findings are of particular importance
when related to the interpretation of cancer
incidence studies ... . the fact that
misdiagnosis does not occur randomly in the
population has to be taken into account
whenever inter-ethnic comparisons are made.

Overreporting of certain types of cancer also occurs,
as evidenced by a 1981 letter to the editor of the New England
Journal of Medicine.}3 the authors investigated the
"allegedly high mortality rates for cancer of the pancreas" in
male residents of two counties in Kansas, which had been :
identified in a 1973 government cancer mortality atlas. 14
All death certificates coded to pancreatic cancer for these
counties were obtained for the appropriate time period, and
