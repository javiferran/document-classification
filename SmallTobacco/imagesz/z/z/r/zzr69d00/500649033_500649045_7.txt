there seem to be no consistent patterns or obvious explana-

tions for the discrepancies.

In one study of 493 cancer cases in a New York City
hospital, only 44 percent of the clinical diagnoses of lung
cancer were confirmed at autopsy.” Also, the authors found
that "carcinoma of the lung was the only major neoplasm in
which no cases were found at autopsy in addition to those
diagnosed clinically." [Emphasis added] It was suggested
further by the researchers that the overdiagnosis problem
observed in their study might be due to the similarity in
appearance between primary cancer of the lung and other can-

cers that had metastasized or spread to the lung.

Conversely, a Boston hospital study found that lung
cancer cases were missed clinically. Of lung cancers con-

firmed at autopsy, 27 percent had not been diagnosed in the

10

hospital. The Boston researchers did not address the

question of clinical overdiagnosis.

Other studies, from Israel,
Scotlanat} and New york, 16 have found varying rates of

overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of lung cancer.

Researchers from Yale Medical School have offered a

possible explanation for misdiagnoses of lung cancer, based on

their patient data that included smoking information. In
