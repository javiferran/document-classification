a study of 654 cases in which primary lung cancer was found at
autopsy, the investigators reported that 16 percent of these
cases had not been clinically diagnosed. They hypothesized
that physicians may use more diagnostic tests for lung cancer
when a patient is a smoker than when the patient is a non-
smoker. They called this tendency "detection bias." This
could account for the failure to diagnose lung cancer in some

nonsmokers.

Indeed, data from the Yale study "suggested that the
more patients smoked, the more likely they were to have their
lung cancer detected during life." Further, cytological
examination of the sputum (a diagnostic procedure for lung
cancer) had been ordered for a significantly higher percentage
of smokers than it had been for nonsmokers. In fact, it
appeared that the rate of ordering such a test was related to

the amount that the patient smoked.

The authors concluded that "the rates of diagnosis may
be affected by bias in the way that doctors order and deploy
the available diagnostic technology."

Conclusion
Mortality statistics are often relied on by investiga-

tors with little recognition that such data may contain inac-

curacies. Death certificates, the main source for mortality
