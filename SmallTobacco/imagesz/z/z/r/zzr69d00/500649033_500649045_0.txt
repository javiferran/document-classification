Mortality Data: How Reliable? How Accurate?

For many years, the U.S. and other countries have
compiled "vital statistics" to monitor and study the health
Status of their populations. Included in these vital statis-
tics are numbers of deaths, usually. .classified by cause. Such
mortality data can be useful in identifying and evaluating
trends in specific diseases, in setting health research
priorities, and, by way of epidemiological studies, in sug-
gesting factors that may be associated with certain diseases.
It is obvious that for valid conclusions to be drawn from
these types of statistical studies, mortality data must have a

high degree of reliability.

Sources of Mortality Data: Death Certificates

Mortality data generally come from death certificates.
AS a result, scientists and statisticians have been concerned
with the quality of this source of information. Some comments
from the medical and scientific literature!~4 indicate the

depth of concern:

It has become obvious that in many cases the
diagnosis on a death certificate may have
actually no bearing whatsoever or any rela-
tion to the cause of death of a given patient.

Disquiet exists about the accuracy of the
diagnostic information contained in the
medical certificate of cause of death even in
cases when a full post-mortem examination is
carried out.
