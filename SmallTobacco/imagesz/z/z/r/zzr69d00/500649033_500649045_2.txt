A number of recent studies have used autopsy findings
to evaluate the accuracy of clinical diagnoses. A 1980 study
in Finland, for example, compared clinical and autopsy diag-
noses in 377 cancer patients and found substantial disagree-
ment. The investigators concluded: “Our study indicates that
accurate clinical diagnosis remains a significant problem

despite modern medical resources."?

Even if the correct clinical diagnosis is made, it may
not be recorded properly on the death certificate. In 1979,
U.S. researchers compared the hospital diagnosis for 9,724
deaths with the underlying cause of death recorded on the
death certificate and found agreement in only 72 percent of

the cases.3

Various reasons have been suggested for recording
errors. One pathologist has commented that many physicians
"regard the death certificate as a document which simply
declares that the death was due to natural causes and does not
have medico-legal significance." He noted also that "doctors
certifying deaths often fail to realise that the information
they record is utilised by the statistician for compiling data

of epidemiological significance."®

Most recently, the whole question of death certificate

accuracy and its effect on mortality statistics was addressed
