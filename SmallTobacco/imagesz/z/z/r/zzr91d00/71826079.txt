October 27, 1994

To All Members of The A-Team:

As indicated in prior employee meetings and other communications, clearance by the
Federal Trade Cornmission of the sale of our Company to B.A.T. Industries was not
certain. As the attached communication from American Brands States, the F.7.C. has not
approved the sale and will seek a court order preventing the transaction. Apparently, the
next step involves litigation to resolve the issues and whether the sale can be completed,

What fies ahead? Undoubtedly, more uncertainty as no one can be sure at this point what
the outcome of the litigation will be, but, certainly, the buyer and seller remain hopeful that
the sale will be approved, and their commitment to the sale and their determination at this
time has not changed,

As for The American Tobacco Company, "Pride in Performance” will continue to be our
focus, and our efforts to maintain the success of Operation Restoration will continue.
With your help we will become stronger, not weaker, realizing that it is in our best interest
to do so. Nevertheless, the challenge will become greater as the uncertainty continues for
what is still an indefinite period of time.

But, as we have said before attitude is everything, and we will keep it positive and hope
for the best as we strive to keep being the best. What we have been able to achieve
together throughout this year has been remarkable and you should feel very proud of your
accomplishments,

As more information becomes available, you will be informed as quickly as possible as our
commitment and determination to “communicate, communicate, communicate" becomes
even more important than ever.

However difficult the circumstances may be, /et’s keep making good things happen.
