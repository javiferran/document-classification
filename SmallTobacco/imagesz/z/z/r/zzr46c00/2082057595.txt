FYI - to keep you guys in the loop...

The conference room in E1 is ours through the end of August. The badge reader will be activated at the
close of business on Friday. There will be one generic badge for entering and exiting the room and my
badge will also be recognized by the reader. Security has my name and numbers as the contact. There is
one potential problem with August 20 - 23 (Norma Machich wants the room for "kids day”) - she and I
have already spoken on this issue and I have it on my tickler to follow up with her at the end of July as to
whether or not she will need to move the "kids day activities” to another conference room.

We have a retiree (Ed Stultz) who is interested in covering the production and he is available for weekends
and after hours. Jim McNasby and I are coordinating on having Ed Stultz brought in through the
arrangement we have with HGW. (If there are any glitches in Ed's availability, I plan to fill in on
coverage.)
