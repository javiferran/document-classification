constant agitation at 100 rpm on a reciprocating shaker. After pre-
incubation, 0.5 ml of 4 mM aniline hydrochloride (or 0.5 ml of phosphate
buffer for tissue blanks) was added to flasks and incubation was conti-
nued for 15 minutes. Reaction was terminated by addition of 1.0 ml 20%
TCA to the incubation flasks, Samples were centrifuged for five minutes
at 5,000 rpm to pellet protein precipitates and 1.0 ml of supernatant
were added to 1.0 mi 10% aqueous NagCO3 in a 15 ml culture tube and
vortexed. One ml of 2% phenol in 0.2N NaOH were then added and vortexed
and color was allowed to develop for 30 minutes at 37°C. The concen-
tration of p-aminophenol formed by hydroxylation of aniline was deter-
mined spectrophotometrically (phenol-indophenol complex) at 640 nm using
the tissue blanks for background correction.

Statistical Analysis

The data of the control groups in this study-were statistically
compared with the treated group data of the same sex using a two-tailed
Student's tetest® at the 5% probability level. Student's t-test calcu-
lates the probability that the means of two data sets are statistically
equivalent with 95% certainty. The following symbols denote a statis-
tical difference where the variances between the mean values of the
control and treated groups fall outside of the 95% confidence limits
{p<0.05) and are noted in the text and in the tables of this report:

s+ = Significantly higher than control value
at p<0.05,

s- = Significantly lower than control value
at p<0.05,
