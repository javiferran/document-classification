SUBJECT: INDUCTION OF HEPATIC MICROSOMAL ENZYMES WITH B-85
IN RATS AND MICE .
Borriston Project No. 251-K(3}
FINAL REPORT

SUMMARY

Three methods were employed to evaluate the induction potential of
the test article, B-85, on rodent hepatic microsomal enzymes. Hexobarbital
sleep-times were measured in both male and female’mice pretreated for
four days with B-85 at ninety-one percent of the Maximum Tolerated Dose(MTD).

No decrease in sleep-time was observed in male mice treated with
test article B-85. A statistically significant decrease was observed in
female mice treated with B-85; however, the decrease does not appear to
be biologically significant. The mice treated with phenobarbital showed _
decreased sleep times. Microsomal p-nitroanisole O-demethylase and
aniline hydroxylase activities were measured in microsomal suspensions
prepared from excised rat livers. No significant increases were observed
in either of the enzyme activities assayed in microsomal suspensions
from any of the rats treated with test article B-85. The rats treated
with phenobarbital showed significantly increased enzyme activities for
both of the enzymes assayed. All three methods indicate that test
article 8-85 does not induce rodent hepatic microsomal enzymes at a = —
treatment level of ninety-one percent of the MTD.
