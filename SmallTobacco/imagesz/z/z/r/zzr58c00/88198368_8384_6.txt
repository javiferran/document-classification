RESULTS

Hexobarbital Sleeping-Time

The hexobarbital sleep-times for male mice are shown in Table 1
and for female mice in Table 2. No decrease in sleep-time was observed
in male mice treated with test article 8-85. A statistically signifi-

cant decrease was observed in female mice treated with B-85 at 91% of
the MTD; however, the decrease does not appear to be biologically signi-

ficant. The mice treated with phenobarbital (positive control) showed
decreased sleep times. The individual and mean body weights for the
mice in each treatment group are shown in Tables 3 and 4. There were
only minor changes in mean body weights of the mice throughout the study.

In Vitro Enzyme Induction Assays

The results of the enzyme induction assays are shown in Table 5 for
male rats and Table 6 for female rats. No significant increases were
observed in either of the enzyme activities assayed in microsomal suspen-
sions from any of the rats treated with test article B-85. The rats
treated with phenobarbital showed significantly increased enzyme acti-
vities for both of the enzymes assayed. These studies indicate that
test article B-85 does not induce liver microsomal enzymes at a treat-
ment level of 91% of the MTD (1250 mg/kg). The individual and mean
body weights for the rats in each group are shown in Tables 7 and 8.
There were decreases observed in mean body weights for all the groups of
rats used in the in vitro enzyme induction assays. The decreases in
body weights were the result of removing the rat chow from the rats the

night before sacrificing the animals.
