Preparation of Liver Homogenates

Livers were minced and rinsed with cold Tris buffer. Sufficient
buffer was added to produce a 25% w/v homogenate. The livers were then
homogenized with a Brinkman Polytron® homogenizer. The livers were
centrifuged at 10,000 x g at 0-4°C for 30 minutes to prepare the post-
mitochondrial supernatants. The supernatants were then centrifuged at
300,000 x g (ca. 55,000 rpm) for 30 minutes. The supernatants were
discarded and the microsomal pellets were resuspended in the original
volume of buffer and centrifuged again at 300,000 x g for 30 minutes.
The microsomal pellets were stored frozen at -80°C for subsequent use.

O-Demethylation of p-Nitroanisole (PNA)

Liver microsomal suspensions were prepared by resuspending the pel-
lets in the original volume of buffer. The suspensions were analyzed in
duplicate for each group of five same sex rats for each treatment.

Exactly 0.15 ml of each suspension was added to test tubes on ice con-
taining the following: 0.15 mil of 250 units NADPH (Sigma Type X) in O.1M
phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 1.5 ml of p=nitroanisole (3.0 uM), 1 drop MgCl
(12.5 mM), 0.7 ml] phosphate buffer pH 7.4, The test tubes are then incu-
bated for 30 minutes at 37°C with constant agitation at 100 rpm on a
reciprocating shaker. Reactions were terminated by placing the test tubes
on ice. Samples were then centrifuged at 5,000 x g for five minutes to
pelletize protein. The supernates were then poured into cuvettes and the
concentration of p-nitrophenol formed by O-demethylation of PNA was deter-
mined spectrophotometrically at 420 nm using a tissue blank for back-
ground correction.

Hydroxylation of Aniline

Liver microsomal suspensions were analyzed in duplicate for
each group of five same sex rats for each treatment. One mi of each
suspension was added to 25 ml Erlenmeyer flasks on ice containing three
glass beads (6 mm) and 1.0 ml master mix (50.7 uM NADP*Na, 3280 uM
nicotinamide, 500 uM glucose-6-phosphate, 500 uM MgClo and 250 units
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [Sigma Type XV] in pH 7.4, 0.1M phos-
phate buffer). Flasks were pre-incubated for two minutes at 37°C with
