INTRODUCTION

This study was designed to evaluate the induction potential of the
test article, B-85, by monitoring increases in microsomal mixed function
oxidase activity. Decreased sleep-time response in mice to hexobarbital
is used in this study as a non-specific indicator of hepatic microsomal
activity. p-Nitroanisole O-demethylase and aniline hydroxylase assays
using isolated rat liver microsomes are used to measure more specific
forms of liver induction.

TEST ARTICLE

The test article, B-85, is a liquid and was received from the
sponsor on July 15, 1981. The test article was stored at room temper-
ature in the containers in which it was received. Methylcellulase (1%)
was used as the vehicle in this study.

Appropriate amounts of 8-85 were mixed with 1% methylcellulose to
acheive the correct dose level. The volume of 1% methylcellulose
containing Be85 administered per unit body weight was 10 ml/kg during
the study. All mixtures were thoroughly agitated just prior to and
continually during dosing.

HEXOBARBITAL SLEEPING-TIME ASSAY

Test Animals

Fifteen male and fifteen female CD1 albino mice, purchased from
Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Inc. (Wilmington, Massachusetts),
weighing 20-30 g, were selected for this study. Prior to placement on
study, the animals were quarantined for at least seven days and observed
daily for appearance and behavior. The animals were group housed (5/cage)
in suspended stainless steel wire-mesh bottom cages. Purina® Rodent
Laboratory Chow® #5001 and water were available ad libitum.

Experimental Design

At the end of the quarantine period, healthy animals were assigned
to the following treatment groups using a computer generated random
number listing:
