SUBJECT: Scientific Article

 

Attached hereto is an important and interesting recently published article
by Dr. Carl C. Seltzer at Harvard. It contains a critical analysis of the
Framingham Heart Study, which has been the principal epidemiological study
relied upon by the Surgeon General to reach his conclusion that there is a
strong, association between smoking and coronary heart disease (CHD).

In this article, Dr. Seltzer disputes the Surgeon General's conclusion and
points to a number of unexplained anomalies in the data. The most significant

points are:

1. The statistical association between smoking and heart disease is below
the level established by Hutchison and Wynder for the conclusion of a
strong association. In fact, under the Hutchison-Wynder criterion,
the association would be designated as "weak."

2. The Framingham data do not demonstrate any increase in the incidence
of CHD based upon the duration of smoking in either men or women.

3. Most significant is the finding that smokers who quit smoking have a
lower incidence of CHD than people who have never smoked at all.

Dr. Seltzer concludes that the important Framingham study simply does not
support the "conventional wisdom" which the Surgeon General has propagated.
