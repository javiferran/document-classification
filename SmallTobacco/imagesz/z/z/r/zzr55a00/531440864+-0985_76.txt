WYDEN'S MISSION AIDS HIS AMBITION

TYPE: Letters to the editor

TEXT:

To the Editor: Oregon's U.S. Rep. Ron Wyden is on a great crusade against
the tobacco industry, 40 million folks who smoke and the prospect that a
teen-ager might make the choice to take up smoking. Yet he is the intense
promoter of the abortion pill, RU-486, which will kill thousands of babies
who will have no choice.

1 am not a smoker, but I do resent this representative's do-gooder
actions for his own political agenda.
