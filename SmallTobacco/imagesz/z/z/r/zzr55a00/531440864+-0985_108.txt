House passage. But approval by the Senate is questionable.

A staff assistant to the Democratic leadership in the Senate said that
bills restricting smoking were not the highest priority before committees
and subcommittees and could probably be blocked this year by a few senators
from tobacco states.

The lawmakers from tobacco states do not have the political strength
they once did. But like the opponents of gun control and advocates of
agriculture subsidies, the political forces battling limits on smoking have
such a direct stake in the matter that they care more and fight harder than
do those on the anti-smoking side.

Rep. Ron Wyden , D-Ore., who has worked for years for tougher
legislation against smoking, said: “What's happened in Congress is that
it's very easy to block something and very hard to thread the needic. You
have a group, obviously from tobacco states and districts, where there's
an extremely passionate feeling.”

 

But like most of his colleagues, Wyden senses that the forces opposing
legislation against tobacco are on the decline and that it is only a
matter of time before strong laws against smoking are enacted. “*]
personally think what they're faced with is a tidal wave,” he said, “and
when you talk to tobacco -state legislators, they know that."
