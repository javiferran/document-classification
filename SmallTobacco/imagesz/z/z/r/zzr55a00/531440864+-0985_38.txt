health and safety. Supports other initiatives to simplify federal rules and
make them more flexible. Backed a bill to allow companies such as Intel
Corp. greater freedom in meeting clean-air standards.

FOREIGN POLICY
INTERNATIONAL TRADE

THE ISSUE: The United States continues to resist creating barriers
against imports and is a partner in the North American Free Trade
Agreement.

WYDEN : Backed Nafta and has consistently voted against erecting U.S.
import barriers. Wants to expand Nafta to cover free-trade area from Canada
to South America. Says any current trade problems with Mexico stem not from
Nafta but from the way the United States handled Mexico's devaluation of
the peso. Has opposed linking China's trade status to human-rights issues.

SMITH: Generally backs international free-trade agreements, including
Nafta. But says he has ‘a growing sense of alarm" about Nafta and wants
to have it regularly reviewed, Says he doesn't have firm opinion yet on
whether Nafta should be extended to the rest of the Americas. Opposes
linking trade to human-rights violations in China.
