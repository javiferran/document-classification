British Columbia, meanwhile, became the first Canadian province to
follow the lead of the United States and demand that tobacco companies
pay for health costs associated with smoking.

But even as the anti-smoking drive gains momentum in Western Europe, it
has made few inroads in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.

In eastern Africa, tobacco companies face no restrictions beyond
health warnings on cigarette boxes, and there are no anti-smoking
lobbies. There arc some indications that the big tobacco companics
consider the region a growth area, with smoking on the rise among urban
middle-class youngsters.

One company has sponsored smoking contests in Kenya, with participants
competing over who can smoke the most cigarettes simultancously.

In Japan, foreign cigarette companies, mainly from the United States,
take up more than 20 percent of the Japanese market, and the U.S. share is
growing. About 35 percent of the population smokes -- 60 percent of the men
and 18 percent of the women.

The residents of former Yugoslavia have placed little emphasis on the
dangers of nicotine. During the civil war of 1992-95, soldiers were often
paid in cigarettes . The Sarajevo tobacco factory is one of only a few
companies working at full capacity today.

In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Palestinian government is fighting
a losing battle to enforce a smoking ban.

“Doctors smoke in hospitals; teachers smoke in schools,” Health
Minister Riyad Zanoun said with exasperation.

Several Eastern European nations recently passed legislation banning
cigarette advertising on television, but manufacturers have found
creative ways around the laws.

In Sofia, Bulgaria, a billboard reads *‘Marlboro Country" -- making its
pitch without showing any cigarettes .
