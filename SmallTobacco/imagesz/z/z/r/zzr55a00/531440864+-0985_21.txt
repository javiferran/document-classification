Against that backdrop, Wyden ‘s fast break is easy to spot. He's one of
the few trying to make progress.

But Congress soon may catch up to Wyden 's pace. The Senate is expected
to take up several controversial bills with potentially enormous effect on
the environment and economy of Western states.

The first, in fact, is scheduled for Tuesday, The Senate will consider a
bill that would require the government to pursue construction of a
temporary nuclear waste storage site al Yucca Mountain, Nev.

President Clinton and Nevada's two Democratic senators oppose the bill,
But Wyden voted last month to send it to the Senate floor after the
Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved his two amendments. They
include language that would bar Washington's Hanford Nuclear Reservation as
a backup site.

Other potentially troublesome issues could include updates of the
Endangered Species Act and the Northwest Power Act. Both could be critical
tests of his moderation.

The political consequences of his voles might be steep, but Wyden said
he relishes the chance to make a difference on so many issues in the
Senate. The way Wyden secs it, he’s adding dimensions to his game.

“In the pros, everybody can shoot," Wyden said. “The question is,
can you do other things that are so important to bring people together?"
