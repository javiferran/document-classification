WASHINGTON - Two congressmen do not have to tum over Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Co. documents they got from a whistleblower, an appeals court

said Tucsday.

The Constitution protects Reps. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Ron Wyden ,
D-Ore., from having to provide the documents to the cigarette: maker, said
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

Brown & Williamson sought the documents for use in its lawsuit against a
former employee of a law firm that represented the company.

The internal documents indicate that top Brown & Williamson executives
knew smoking was addictive and dangerous 30 years ago but hid their
evidence and muzzled attempts to develop a safer cigaretic .

The three-judge appeals panel upheld a district court ruling. But Judge
Laurence Silberman wrote that the court did not intend to take sides on the
smoking issue.

Silberman said Waxman and Wyden are protected by a clause of the
Constitution that shields members of Congress from being questioned about
any “speech or debate” in the House or Senate.
