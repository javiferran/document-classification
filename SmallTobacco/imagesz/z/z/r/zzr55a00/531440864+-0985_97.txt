WASHINGTON - Rep. Ron Wyden , D-Ore., refused on Tuesday to comply with a
Kentucky judge's order to let a tobacco company review documents it says

were stolen by a disgruntled employce.

Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. subpoenaed Wyden and Rep. Henry A.
Waxman, D-Calif., the health subcommittee chairman, and several members of
the press who have the documents. At issue are confidential company records
indicating thal executives knew more than 30 years ago that smoking is
dangerous and nicotine is addictive.

Wyden and Waxman, both leading smoking foes in the House, dismissed their
subpoenas as an attempt lo intimidate the House subcommittee on health and
the environment, which is considering legislation to regulate tobacco as
adrug. Wyden and Waxman are leading supporters of the measure.

Last month, Waxman ordered the country's seven largest tobacco
companies (o turn over their studies on cigarette safety and
addictiveness, In recent weeks, the company documents have been the focus
of several news stories.

“This appears to be little more than an attempt to divert attcntion
from numerous published reports that a major tobacco company conspired to
hide evidence of the addictive and dangerous nature of cigarcttes ,"
Wyden said Tuesday.

He defended the committee's investigation of tobacco companies. *‘No
one -- not even the tobacco companies -- can interfere with that
investigation.”
