“Viewed from another perspective, they may be evidence supporting a
whistleblower's’ claim that the tobacco company concealed from its

customers and the American public the iruth regarding the health hazards of
tobacco ,” Greene wrote.

He went on to say that siding with Brown and Williamson would mean that
companies could “bury unlawful or potentially unlawful acts” by charging
that “inconvenient documentary evidence" had been stolen.

Greene also said that cven if thc documents were stolen, Waxman and
Wyden were not legally bound to turn them over to the company.
A Brown & Williamson spokesman said the company would appeal. “It
appears lo say il’s OK for Congress to participate in iHegal activities as

Jong as they didn't commit the crimes,” company spokesman Tom Fitzgerald
said.

Wyden was clated by the ruling.

“The decision says that Brown and Williamson isn't free to intimidate
whistleblowers, " Wyden said in a prepared statement. “The time for
stalling, diversions and pseudo science is at an end."
