TEXT:
WASHINGTON - Summary: A nonpartisan group says the two Republicans favored
the industry on seven main tobacco -related questions before Congress

Several Northwest congressional Republicans fared poorly on an anti-
tobacco group's voter scorecard, with Oregon Rep. Wes Cooley and
Washington Rep. Doc Hastings earning ~* zeroes. "

But only Washington Reps. Jennifer Dunn and Rick White, with who had
average scores on the voles reviewed, accepted significantly more than the
House average in campaign contributions from tobacco industry political
action committees, the group said.

Cooley and Hastings were among 80 House members who opposed the public
health position and instead favored the tobacco industry position on all

seven of the main tobacco -related questions that faced the 104th
Congress, according to Smokefree Action, a nonpartisan coalition of anti-
tobacco health advocates based in Pittsburgh.

Cooley accepted $3,000 from the tobacco industry in the 1995-96
election cycle before ending his re-election campaign amid questions about
his war record and his wife's acceptance of veterans’ benefits. Hastings
accepted $3,500, slightly more than the congressional average of $3,275.

“Few voters know that numerous issues affecting tobacco were
considered by this Congress, which sided with the tobacco industry nearly
every time,” said Bill Godshall, director of Smokefree Action.

The 80 House members who got zeroes received an average of $7,801 from
the tobacco industry, while the 100 members who got 100 percent accepted
an average of $119 from the industry, Godshall said.

However, the money didn’t always follow the voting patterns in the
Northwest.

Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash., has accepted no money from the tobacco
industry but got the next-to-worst rating among Washington lawmakers,
bucking the industry only 14 percent of the time, the group said.

The average rating among House members was 43 percent.
