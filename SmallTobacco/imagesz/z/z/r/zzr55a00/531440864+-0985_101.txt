nicotine. But DeNoble said these chemicals were never used and he did not
know why.

Leo Abood, a University of Rochester professor who did consulting work
for Philip Morris, said it would not have made sense for the company to
pursue substitutes for nicotine im cigarettes , since any substitutes
would have been regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

DeNoble suggested at the hearing that the company might have been able
to avoid FDA regulation if it could have developed a strain of tobacco
that would contain the nicotine substitute,

The FDA is now considering regulating cigarettes as a drug, partly
because FDA Commissioner David Kessler says tobacco companies may be
manipulating the level of nicotine in their cigarettes .

Rep. Ron Wyden , D-Ore., said Philip Morris’ search for a nicotine
substitute provides additional proof that cigarette companies control how
much nicotine is in cigarettes .

Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., said most of the ill effects of cigarettes
would have remained despite any industry efforts to get rid of the
nicotine.

“If they think they can come to the public and say we've taken the
nicotine out of the product and love us again, they're sadly mistaken,"
Synar said.

Steve Parrish, senior vice president of Philip Morris USA, said Thursday
that the nicotine research made sense because the company wanted to know
more aboul its own products. But he said he could not comment further on
the goals of the nicotine program or its results until he had reviewed
documents that the company is preparing to turn over to the subcommittee.
