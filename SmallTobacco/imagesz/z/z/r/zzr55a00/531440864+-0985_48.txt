Metzenbaum, now chairman of the Consumer Federation of America, said in
a letter Tuesday that he supports Wyden ,

“You and I stood shoulder-to-shoulder in fighting for consumers on

challenging health care issues and insurance company rip-offs," Mctzcnbaum
wrote.

The federation has named Wyden a “Lifetime Consumer Hero" and gives

him a lifetime voting record of 91 percent, compared with DeFazio's 81
percent.

Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers Union, publisher of
Consumer Reports, called Wyden ~*a strong and steady advocate on behalf
of consumers.”

Lisa Grove Donovan, spokeswoman for Wyden ‘s campaign, said she did not
know why Nader was altacking Wyden .

“From the moment Ron went to Congress, there is no question he always
fought for what he believes in. Sometimes that has meant standing with

environmental and other consumer groups rather than with Ralph Nader," she
said.

Pat Ewing, DcFazio's campaign manager, said Nader's opinion could be
significant in the primary, in which Wyden is considered the front-runner
for the seat vacated by Republican Sen. Bob Packwood.

“Ron Wyden has touted himself as the No. 1 consumer advocate in

Oregon and the No. | consumer advocate in the country says it isn't true,”
Ewing said,

Nader said Wyden joined Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., in the “tobacco
fight,” then backed off and accepted a voluntary industry program to curb
cigarelie sales to minors.
