REGULATION OF TOBACCO GETS WYDEN'S SUPPORT
Oregonian (PO) - WEDNESDAY, June 22, 1994

TEXT:
WASHINGTON - Rep. Ron Wyden thinks the federal government should do more
to regulate tobacco .

The Oregon Democrat, who in recent months has emerged as a leading
congressional tobacco opponent, said the aim should focus on keeping
cigarettes away from children.

Wyden is amember of a subcommittee that Tuesday heard David Kessler, the
head of the Food and Drug Administration, tell how tobacco companies
manipulated the nicotine content of cigarettes . The subcommittee is
debating whether to regulate tobacco as a drug.

Wyden said the FDA clearly is preparing a lengthy administrative
record that ultimately may lead Congress to request strict nicotine
regulations.

If that happens, Wyden sees a new classification, “a unique
regulatory system” that would fall somewhere short of how prescription
drugs are handled but with very specific objectives.

“The new regulatory system should be aimed, first and foremost, at
keeping cigarettes out of the hands of children," he said after the
hearing.

Wyden wants to see a federal minimum smoking age. He called state laws
that set minimum ages **a joke," given statistics that show a majority of
smokers are hooked by the age of 18.

He also wants to look at reducing the nicotine levels to help wean
smokers off cigarettes .

He does not favor a cigarette ban.

“It would cause chaos. But you can have a very aggressive federal
effort to keep young kids from getting started, and you can watch nicotine
levels. I want to eliminate the next generation of smokers."
