TEXT:

Even when I] was a smoker, ] knew smoking to be a messy and offensive habit.
And expensive -- not just in the cost of the weed, but also in the damage

it causes, from holes in clothing to holes in the ground where houses once
stood, At some point it became clear that it is also a health hazard, and

not just 10 smokers.

It's hard to think of anything that could bring me riding to the defense
of the deadly tobacco industry.

Til give it to California's Henry Waxman, Oklahoma's Mike Synar and
Oregon's Ron Wyden , though. They keep trying.

These three House Democrats haven't been trying to drum up sympathy for
cigarette manufacturers; quite the contrary. They have been trying to
destroy the industry.

And even that won't evoke much pro-industry sympathy from me. What does
move me to this faint defense of the indefensible are the tactics of these
congressional crusaders.

The approach is by now familiar to C-SPAN watchers. Representatives of
the industry are invited to the Hill, ostensibly to testify, but in reality
to serve as foils for legislators whose minds have long since been made up.

Why don't you admit that you're adding nicotine to your product in order
to make it more addictive? the lawmakers will ask, sounding oh so
reasonable. We don't add nicotine, the manufacturers will reply. We blend
different types of tobacco , containing varying amounts of nicotine, but
the nicotine is already in the plant. We don't add any.

Haven't you patented the technology to add nicotine if you wanted 10?
Yes, but we don’t use it. We don't add nicotine.

Then follows this wonderfully scientific exchange:

You do, too.

We don't, either,

Do.

Don't.
