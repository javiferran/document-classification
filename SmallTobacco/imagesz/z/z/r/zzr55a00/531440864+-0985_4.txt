TEXT:

WASHINGTON -- Sen. Ron Wyden , D-Ore., plans today to join three other
Democratic senators in an effort to limit the federal government's
assistance to U.S. cigarette -makers in booming foreign markets.

Wyden will co-sponsor the Worldwide Tobacco Disclosure Act of 1997. It
would prohibit the administration from engaging in trade practices that
have the effect of weakening foreign countriesâ€˜ anti tobacco laws.

The bill is one of many Congress is likely to consider in light of the
tobacco industry's tentative agreement to settle claims by 40 state
attorneys general for $368.5 billion,

That settlement also must be written in the form of a bill, be approved
by Congress and signed by President Clinton. Its prospects are unclear.

The bill co-sponsored by Wyden would require U.S. companies to apply
the same health warnings to exported cigarettes as they now must affix to
cigarettes sold domestically.

The bill also would prevent the government from taking steps such as
opposing advertising bans in foreign countries.

In 1996, U.S. tobacco companies sold 269.7 billion cigarettes
abroad, up from 260.7 billion the previous year, according to Davenport &
Co., a stock brokerage in Richmond, Va.

The bill's lead sponsor is Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. On Tuesday,
Lautenberg and Wyden sent letters to several administration officials,
including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, asking for their support.
