consumers, he said. Regulating fertility clinics requires greater
accountability by providers, he says. His Medigap bill is a step toward
insurance reform, he says.

That won grudging respect even from fellow Oregon Democrat Peter
DeFazio, who one day may oppose him for a Senate seat.

That was his most significant contribution,” DeFazio said of Wyden
's Medigap bill. “It was very important. There have been extraordinary
abuses."

The Constitution provides only one way to measure the effectiveness of
members of Congress -- elections. By that standard, Wyden can be
considered remarkably successful. He won his seventh term in 1992 with a
whopping 77 percent, and he's expected to win his eighth term with little
trouble in November,

In the end, there's nothing improper about publicity, said Martin Corry,
director of federal affairs for the American Association of Retired
Persons.

“There's nothing wrong in occasionally grabbing a ncon issuc," he
said, “The question is what do you do with it. Ron has been very good
about not just making statements about problems but in doing the hard
work."

“Does he like the spotlight?" a congressional aide asked. Well,
yeah. But show me a member of Congress who doesn't."
