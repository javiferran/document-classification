WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - The head of RJR Nabisco said Friday he intends to
wam people in Third World countries of the dangers of smoking, even where.
warnings are not mandatory.

RJR already is doing that in many such countries, a company spokesman
said later.

RIR chief Steven F. Goldstone joined a growing number of tobacco

executives who have testified that cigarettes might be linked to cancer.
“T have always believed that smoking plays a part in causing lung

cancer. What that role is, ] don't know, but I do believe it,” Goldstone,

a former smoker, said,

Goaldstone's comments about warnings was a good first step, said Sen. Ron
Wyden , D-Ore., who has pushed for legislation to require warnings
worldwide that are no more lenient than the ones in the United States.

“This is a hopeful development, but unless it's matched with a real
commitment to stop marketing cigarettes to kids overseas, it is way too
little and far too late," Wyden said.
