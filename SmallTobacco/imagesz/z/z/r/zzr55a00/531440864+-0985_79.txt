British-American Tobacco Co., as revealed Thursday, include:

*Project Truth, a 1971 campaign to convince the public that smoking was
not dangerous and that studies showing that mice exposcd to tobacco
developed cancer “have little, if any, relationship to cigaretle
smoke."

*Project Janus, corporate experiments conducted from 1965 to 1978, which
demonstrated that 80 percent of mice exposed to tobacco developed tumors
and more than half developed malignancies. A 1971 annual report recognized
that such mouse studies were “likely to remain an important recognized
test” of cancer-causing agents.

*Project Aries, presented at a corporate conference in 1984, which
studied development of a filter to enhance nicotine **in later puffs."

The hearing's starkest contrast came in an exchange between Sandefur --
gray-haired, gravely voiced and strongly Southern in accent and demeanor --
and Washington Democrat Mike Kreidler, an avid runner and smoking foc.
Kreidler told Sandefur that his father started smoking at age 14, Sandefur
interrupted to tell him that his **daddy did, too," that he quit 25 years
later, is 82 now and ~“doing fine, thank you.”

Kreidler then continued his story: “In 1985 I held my dad's hand while
he died of emphysema."
