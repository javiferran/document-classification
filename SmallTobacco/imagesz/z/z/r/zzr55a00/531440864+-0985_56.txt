of sporting or entertainment events should be dropped. The effectiveness of
such a ban isn't worth the public backlash or protracted legal battles it
will bring.

- His prohibition against sales or giveaways of clothing, bags or caps
with product brands or logos also should dic. The value of the ban doesn't
outweigh the wrath it will bring on the one hand and the black market it
will create on the other. It's foolish to mess with Americansâ€™ T-shirts.

- His plan to force tobacco advertising that appears in publications
with significant youth readership to be in black-and-white only would
Testricl advertising to adults, too. Significant voluntary restrictions on
the content of print advertising and product placements in movies would be
better.

The public shouldn't trust the tobacco industry's motives, but
Americans aren't ready yet for the full measure of FDA regulation of
tobacco , which must necessarily lead eventually to a reduction and
elimination of addictive nicotine in tobacco products.

Clinton and the anti-smoking forces like Wyden are fighting the good
fight. They should keep working for results, not gestures.
