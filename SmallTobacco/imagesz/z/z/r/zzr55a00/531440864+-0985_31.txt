al where they stand on a wide varicty of important issnes, you can be the

SAFETY NET
WELFARE REFORM

THE ISSUE: Congress passed a bill that would eliminate welfare as an
entitlement and fund the program by giving block grants to states.
President Clinton has promised to veto the bill.

WYDEN : Supports welfare reform being tried in Oregon. Accepts requiring
teen-age mothers to live al home as an experiment but is unsure whether it
will work. Opposes a provision that kicks two-parent families off welfare
in the summer. Supports a two-year limit on benefits but opposes reducing
benefits to parents who have additional children on welfare.

SMITH: Voted for Oregon's welfare reform plan, which requires welfare
recipients to participate in an education or training program. There is a
two-year limit on benefits, and teen-age mothers are required to live at
home or in another supervised setting. In the federal arena, Smith supports
most of the GOP plan but opposes reducing benefits to parents who have
additional children while on welfare.

SOCIAL SECURITY

THE ISSUE: Social Security for seniors has been largely untouchable
despite its growing cost. Some in Congress suggest changing calculations of
cost-of-living adjustments to slow growth. The program's disability portion
has come under greater attack.

WYDEN : Supports the senior program and wants thorough review of the
disability program, which he says has â€œbecome an anti-drug program." Says
he is not willing to kick people off disability payments without looking at
where they would end up.
