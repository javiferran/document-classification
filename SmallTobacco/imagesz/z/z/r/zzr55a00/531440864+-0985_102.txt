TEXT:

To the Editor: Rep. Ron Wyden â€˜s introduction of a 7-year-old boy at the
recent tobacco industry hearings was probably the most ridiculous bit of
hyperbole ever perpetuated by an Oregon representative at any gathering.

I am a nonsmoker and concede that smoking probably causes a number of
deaths each year, but ] know with certainty that the abortion drug RU-486
that Wyden is so strenuously promoting causes death without even a chance
of finding a nonsmoking bowling alley.
