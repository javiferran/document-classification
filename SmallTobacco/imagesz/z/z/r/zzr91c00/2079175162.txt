Subject: 2002 Creative Overlay agency meeting with Mike Mahan

This message is from Gina Fawcett (computer upgrade time...)

This meeting has been scheduled for Friday January 5, from 11-1, in 8a1/2. A preliminary look at calendars showed many
of us are free at this time.

As you may de aware, after our brainstorming meeting with Burnett, the agency took our input and comments, as well as
the ideas generated from our internally sponsored brainstorming session, back to their shop. They have compiled our
build ideas and comments into a book, which will be distributed over the next few days. What is coming in to Mike on the
5th is a tighter presentation of the top ideas discussed ai that meeting, You also ray wani to look at the book, because
some of the ideas did not make it inte the creative overlay presentation, but may be worthy of more attention at the
individual group level.

lf you have any questions about this process or the meeting itself, please see Gina Fawcett or Gabrielle Guimand,

Thanks, Gina
