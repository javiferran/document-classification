ar

to cigarette smoke. (Or. H. Herscowitz). Continuation.

    

a. Rationale.

Collatorative studies are in progress with Dr. Herbert
Herscowitz (Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.) regarding the imauno-
suppressive ¢:fects of cigarette smoke in BC3F1/Cum female mice. The
following criteria have been used to determine the immune response:
1) antibody production at the cellular jevel as reflected by the spleen
plaque assay, 2) antibody production in vivo as determined by circulating
hemagglutinating antibocy (HA), and 3) mitogen induced proliferation of
Spleen cells. Previously, Dr. Herscowitz has demonstrated that all 3 re-
SponSes are suppressed in Balb/c mice after exposure to 1R1 cigarette
smioke but not to 1Al cigarette smoke. As reported in the accompenyi ng
Pregress Report, exposure of BC3F1/Cum mice to 2Ri cigarette smoke has not
resulted in consistent depression of antibody production (PFC assay)
when coupared to sham exposed controls.

In order to determine whether the leck of depression of
the PFC response ia BC3F1/Cum mice may be due to differences in strains,
Balb/c and BC3FI/Cum mice will be exposed to smoke at the same time under
the conditions which resulted in a decreased nunbor of PFC in Balb/c mice.
The Balb/c mice would serve as positive conirels of inhibition and the
results from the PFC assays for the two straim will be directly compared.
Under these conditions, mice are immunized with sheep red blocd cells (SRBC)
one day before (Day 0) smoke exposure is initiated, Exposure continucs
for 5 to 7 days (Day 5 to 7) when the nice are sacrificed and spleens
renoved for assay. This immunization and exposure regimen with the 121
cigarette resulted in the following PFC response in Galb/c mice (H. Herscowitz,
Proceeding of 1977 Symposium, Tobacco Health Research Institue, University
of Kentucky, Lexington)
