D. CTR-117. Comparative toxicity of 2R1 and 3A1 cigarette snioke

exposure when the rest period between exposures is eliminated,

1. Rationale.

 

 

Preliminary evidence suggests that BC3F1/Cum mice can be
exposed to 2Rl cigarette smoke continuously ver a 110 minute exposure
regimen (see Progress Report). This means that rather than scheduling
10 minute rest periods between successive exposures the standard pro-
cedure presently used at MA, that this rest period can be eliminated.
Such a procedure would result in the fourteen separate 10 minute ex-
posures during a 140 minute exposure session. The advantage to this
procedure would be that twice the amount of 1PM per mouse could be given
in the same ariount of time. Within the constraints of the smoke distri-
bution valve system in the SEM and the requirement for exposing groups
of 4&0 mice at one time, the only exposure time for which this procedure
can be utilized is 15 seconds smoke/minute.

2. Procedure.

a. BC3F1/Cum mice which have been adapted under standard
protocols wil] be exposed to smoke as described in Table 3.

See #e below for details of exposure.

b. Groups of 30 mice will be exposed to a 140 minute exposure
session where the smoke is continually being generated and offered to
the animals using a one minute exposure schedule of 15 seconds smoke and
45 seconds air.

c. The smoke will be generated either by the first 6, 8, or
10 puffs of the 2R1 cigarette. Thus, six puffs per cigarette means that
a total of 23 cigarettes can be smoked in a 140 minute session (estimated
deposition of 950 ug/day); at 8 puffs a total of 17 cigarettes can be
smoked (estimated deposition of 900 ug/day); and at 10 puffs a total of
14 cigarettes can be smoked (estimated deposition of 920 un/day). These
sessions will yield slightly different TP because the Tast puffs
of 2R1 cigarettes contain much higher TPM than the first puffs.
