b. Procedures.

1) Level of ODC activity induced by exposure to different
cigarette types (2R1 and 3A1).
This experiment will be done as part of CTR-116 and is
described mare. fully in that section.

BC3F1/Cum mice will fe expused to 2R] and 3A] cigarette
smote at a level of approximatley 560-1680 ug TH/day for 90 days. OnC
activity in the Tungs will be assayed at 3, 6, 9 and 24 hours after ex-
posure to the last cigaretic. A mininum of five animals per time point
will be scheduled.

2) Level of OD activity induced by different exposvre
reenscnt to 22) and 3Al cigarette smeke.
Tis experiment will be performed as part of CTR-117 and
is dcecribed rote fully tu that section,

Pulmonary ODC and ANY activity will be determined in
rice exposed ta the various levels of cigarette siske Gescribed in CTR-117,
ei 3, 6, 9 end 24 hours after the last cigarette.

3) Level of OD activity induccd by Tong-tern exposure to
suote frou 2.2 ane 3Al cigarette.
This experiment will be performed as part of the second
lorig-ferm evaluation of the biological effects of whole cigs: ette smoke
in Lhe mouse todel systcm described more fully in the section on CiR-118.

ODC and ANH activity in pulmonary tissue and liver
will be determined after 1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5 years at 3, 6, 9 and 24 hours
after expasure ta the last cigarette. A mininuy of five mice per Lime
point will be scheduled.

conical. Sst—“‘i‘<; 2 OD!” ee

a. Effect of other chemicals on pulmonary ODC activity.

1) Ethanol, water and DMSO are proposed as the solvents in
several of our aerosol studies (see CTR-123). The possible effects of
chronic Jung exposure to ethanol and its consequent effects on liver functions
and a variety of experimental results is an important concern in these
studies. For example, preliminary results indicate that intraperitoneal
inoculation of ethanol results in low level elevation of liver ODC. For
these reasons, the effect of chronic exposure to aerosols of ethanol, water
and DMSO on lung, liver and kidney ODC and AHH levels and other enzynes will
be analyzed. This experiment is described more fully under CIR-123.
