C. Short-term Assays Relating to Possible Initiation Events,

1. CTR-96. Inhibition of pulmonary DiA repair capacity after
exposure to cigarette smoke. (Dr. RK. Rasmussen). Continuation.

a. .Rationale.

Collaborative studies with Dr. R. Rasmussen, (University
of California at Irvine, Irvine CA, CA) are in progress to characterize
the effects of whole cigarette smoke on the capacity of pulmonary tissue
to repair DNA damage in in vitro assay. Previous results indicated that
chronic exposure of BC3Fi/Cum mice to 2Al cigarette smoke resulted in Ã©n
inhibition of repair and that this inhibition persisted for at least 6
months after exposure was terminated. When these studies were extended
to include exposures using 2R1 cigareties and C3N/An? mice,in additio: to
EO3F1/Cum, no inhibition of rcpair was observed up to 27 weeks smoke ex~
posure (sce Proaress Report). Differences in expcsure conditions could account
account for the lack of inhibition with the 21 cigarette and to test this
possibility, the following experiment is in progress.

 

b. Procedure.

The SEM JI B and C are being used to generate smoke from
2R1 and 341 and 2Ai cigareites, BC3F1/Cum mice, 8-10 weeks old, have
been adapted to smoke from all threc cigarette types. The following table
describes the exposure conditions for each cigarette.

. Mice will be shipped to Dr. Rasmussen after 2, 3,4, 5 and

6 months smoke exposure for analysis of pulmonary DNA repair capacity. Mice
from each group and time will be treated at MA with 3H-TdR to determine the
labeling index in lung, trachea, liver, spleen, bladder and kidney (see
CTR-107). Monthly weights are recorded on al1 mice and each smoke ex-
posure is documented and entered on computer. Thus data wil? be available
to estimate the dose of TPN for each cigarette type and a correlation made
with the inhibition or lack of inhibition of pulmonary DNA repair capacity.
