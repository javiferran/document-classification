3. CTR-115. Feasibility studies for aerosolization of selected
chemicals. Continuation.

a. Rationale.

We have reported earlier that BaP and MCA aerosols may be
gencrated from their solutions in DMSO:Ethanol (1:1). Such solutions can
not be used with the presently available polycarbonate modules since DMSO
will react with polycarbonate. If thesé modules can be modified in such
away that they do not come in contract with DMSO and thus are not damaged
by it, then we can use these BeP end KCA aerosols to study biochemical re-
sponses such es ODC, AHH, and CH inductions.

b. Procedure.

To nrotcct the module from the CHSO:ethcnel salvent, we
will determine the feasibility of either a) applying a thin coat of
material which will nat reect chawicelly to PiSd, such es teflon, or
b) use expcsure modules mde frum a meterial ehich is inert to DMSO.

Once we have suftibic exposure modules for BaP and NCA
ecroscls, three strains of mice, BCSFI/Cum, 3C/Anf, and DBA/2d
will be exposed to these aerosols. Five animals each at 4, 6, 8 10,
end 24 hours wi71 be sacrificed tust expasurc. Liver and Jung will be
renoved Trea cach e@tival and analyzed for ARM, OD, and CU induction in
tie Usual i anew.
