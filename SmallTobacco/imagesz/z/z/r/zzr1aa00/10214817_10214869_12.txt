The procedures followed will be those used and developed for
CTR= 100 and CTR-101A and an example of rhe daily schedule is presented
jn Table 5.

a. Mice will be 8-12 weeks old when ear-tagged and put on
test. Each mouse will be individually marked,

b. Observation records will be kept on individual mice. —
Weekly observations will be recorded in all groups and wil] become part
of the permanent computer record for the experiment.

c. Mice will be weighed monthly.

d. Smoke and machine exposure will be initiated gradually
until exposures reach the proposed levels and wil] continue 5 days per
week for the lifetime of the animal.

e. Animals in Group 5 will be treated with BaP intratracheally
at a dose of 250 ug/0.02 m) gel saline at biweekly intervals for a total
of four treatments. As presented in the Progress Report, the tumor
probability for this dose was <0.05 at 52 weeks on test and was 0.1-0.2 at
90 weeks on test. This group will serve as a positive contro? for the
experiment and document the susceptibility of this group of BC3F1/Cum
mice to induced Jung tumors.

f. Urine wil] be collected monthly from each group, and
assayed for 1) mutagenic activity using selected bacterial strains, and
2) nicotine content by gas chromatographic analysis.
