C. CIR-116. Comparative toxicity of 2R1 and 3Al cigarette smoke.

1, Rationale.

This ongoing study is designed to determine the relative
toxicities of exposure to smoke from 2R1 and 3A] reference cigarettes |
using two-140 minute exposure sessions per day. Selected characteristics
for these two reference cigarettes are given in Table 1.

Smoke will be generated on the SEM II from both cigarettes and distributed
in 3 different exposure cycles (Table 2).

2. Procedure.

a. The period of exposure is being varied as described in

Table 2,

b. A total of 60 BC3F1/Cum female mice per group will be
adapted to either 2R1 or 3Al cigarette smoke by increasing exposure levels
by one puff/day until the desired level of exposure is reached.

.c. Animals will be exposed to two 140 minute exposure sessions
per day for 30 days.

d. If 50% of the animals survive by 30 days, the exposure
session will continue for a total of 90 days. ,

e, At 90 days of exposure, the relative toxicities of the
various smoke exposure regimens will be evaluated.
