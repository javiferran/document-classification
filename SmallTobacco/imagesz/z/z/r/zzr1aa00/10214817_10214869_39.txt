c. Biochemical response to nicotine sulfate a√©roso).
(1) Rationale.

The nicotine sulfate aerosol characterized in the
first tvs studies of CTR-115 should be tested for its ability to induce
a biological response in pulmonary tissuc. The enzywes proposed to be
monitored include, AHH, EH, and ODC. The first two enzymes are known
to play a role in nicotine netebolism and the latter enzyme would measure
the capacity of nicotine to be a potential promoter of pulmonary tumors.

(2) Procedure.

Procedures for studying AHii, EH, end GNC induction
have been ovtiince in cur previous studics end will be performed ina
similar uenner.
