substrates are particularly sensitive in detecting cigarette smoke induced
MFQ-induction. It is proposed to schedule sets of six mice per assay point
(three smoke and three sham exposed) for inclusion into studies CTR-116, 119
and CTR-123. At 0, 6, 24, and 4S hours post exposure the MFO activity of
both liver and Tung tissue wil? be examined. Data will be given in terms
of maximum induced MFO levels, time of maximum induction, and half-life of
induced MFO activity.

The assay for ETR O-deethylase activity is performed on Jung
homogenate in the presence of 0.0] mi ethoxyresorufin (dissolved in 0.1 H
Tris-HCL, pH 8.5) in a total volume of 0.4 m}. NADPH (0.125 mM) is added to
initiate the reaction and the fluorescence of the suspension is measured at
an emission wave lensth of 5&6 nanomoles with an excitation wave length of
520 nm using en Amico-Bowman spectrophotofluorometer. A known amount of
resorufin is added after the reaction has pioceeded sufficiently in order
to standardize the fluoremeter. Data is given in ters of nanomoles resorufin
formed per minute per wet weight tissue.
