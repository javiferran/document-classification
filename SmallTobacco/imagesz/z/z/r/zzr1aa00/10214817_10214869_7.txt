B, CTR-101A. Chronic exposure of BC3F1/Cum mice to 2R1 cigarette

Smoke. Continuation.

 

This study is presently on test and is Proposed to continue until
September-December, 1981. At that time the exposure will have continued
for 30 months â€˜and data as to the spontaneoi's and smoke-related histo-
pathology will have been collected for the mean lifetime of BC3F1/Cum
mice. Progress to date and disposition of the animals in this study was
discussed in the accompanying Progress Report.

The level of smoke exposure was to be approximately 400 ug TPM per
lung. This is obtained by an exposure regimen of 8-9 puffs from 5 total
Rl cigarettes at 20 seconds smoke/minute. However because of the high
level of toxicity observed in BG3F1/Cum mice exposed to this regiment,
the protocol was changed in May, 1979, so that only 6 puffs of the 2R1
were used for smoke exposure. Evaluation of smoke exposure data during
the past 3 months has shown the dose to be only 150-300 ug TPM per lung
per day. We feel that this dose should be increased. The
two experiments CTR-116 and 117 are proposed to investigate alternate
exposure regimen to determine if 1000 ug TPM can be given ina way which
is less toxic. This wil] be completed during the next 4-5 months.
CTR-101A may nave a change in protocol, the extent of which is cependent
on the results of these toxicity studies.

It is proposed that approximately 800 animals will continue to
be exposed to the smoke from2R1 cigarettes at the initiation of the
Proposed contract period (January 1, 1980).
