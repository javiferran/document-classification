JI. SUPPORT SERVICES
A. Dosimetry

1. CTR-119. Deposition and distribution of 2Rl_and 3A] cigarette
smoke using exposure conditions resulting in Tow toxicity.

 

a. Rationale.

The results from CTR-116 and 117 will determine the conditions
to be used for the long term studies that were proposed in CTR-118. To
determine the actual distribution and dosimetry of TPH In BC3F1/Cum mice
during these smoking conditions, a dosimetry study using M4c-pT¢c labeled
2R1 and 3A1 cigarettes is proposed. Comparison cf some properties of the
2R1 and 3Al cigarettes were given in Table 1.

b. Procedure.

BC3F1/Cum female mice (7-8 weeks old) will be adapted to
smoke on the SEM II according to the schedule determined in CTR-116 and
117. Exposure to smoke will continue for 30 days before the dos imptry
study with 14¢-pTc. 2Ri and 3A1 cigarettes will be labeled with **C-DTC
(0.75-1.0 uCi/cigarette) uisng cigarette injection machines described
previously. Mice will be exposed to smoke using the SEM IJ, the levei
of radioactivity per ug TPN generated will be calculated and the amount —
of TPM in the head, larynx and upper trachea, lung and lower trachea,
stomach, liver, bladder, kidneys, remains and hide will, be determined using
a Packard 395 TRI-CARB tissue oxidizer and Beckman LS-330 Liquid Scintillation
Counter. In addition, mice will be assayed for MFO activity at O, 6, 24 and
48 hours post exposure (see CTR-108), Data will be presented as ug TPM/mg
wet weight tissue and ug TPM per tissue. ‘
