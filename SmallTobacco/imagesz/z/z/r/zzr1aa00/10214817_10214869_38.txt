5. CIR-122. Studies on nicotine sulfate aerosol.

ORNL hes completed fabrication of a nicotine aeroso} generator,
and it is ready for delivery to MA, It generates aerosols of nicotine
sulfate by nebulization of aqueous solutions of nicotine suifate. After
we have received this cerosal gencrator, we propose to study the followiiy:

a. Particle size distribution,
(1) Rationale.

Since partilce size distribution of the aerosol is onc
of the most irportant factors affecting the Tung coposition of aerosols,
we would like to study this physical characteristic ef nicotine sulfeie
aerosol. However, this study may noc be necessary if dt has been edesua Vy
perrorned at ORAL.

(1) Religie.

In order to cdefing the dese rere ct nicotine sul fete
zerosol which mist be given to the animals to stucy their biechemica]
response, acuic toxicity studies will be pevform.¢ in three different
scrains of mice. Stiudics with nicotine geresol in the free basc staie
suggests that approximately & ug/mous + is the LDsq.i4 for these different
Strains of mice (see Progress Report, April, 1979).

(2) Procedure.

Four dose jevels and ten wice per dose will be used
for each strain of mice. The animals will be observed for 14 days: post
exposure for deaths and the data will be presented as LDs9 for estimated
Core to the lungs. A bricf outline of the experimaint may be found in

able 13.
