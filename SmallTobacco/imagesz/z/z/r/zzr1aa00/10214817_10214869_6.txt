PROPOSED STUDIES
Contract CTR-0030

This Document Subject to
Confidentiality Acreement

The first two proposed changes are straightforward and Process
and Instruments, Inc. has been given authorization to institute these changes
before January 1, 1980. The latter change is presently being evaluated at
MA (see CTR-116 and 117) to determine whether the long term toxicity of this
exposure regimen using both 2R1 and 3A1 cigarettes is acceptible. Data on
toxicity and deposition of two possible smoke exposure reqimens (CTR-116 and
117) will be ava‘lable by January - March of 1980.

Smoke exposure modules and animal holders have been evaluated
and upgraded during the past year and these Studies will continue, Ex-
periments are in progress to determine the type and extent of modifications
required for an improved animal holder and data should be available by
November, 1979,

_ For these reasons, the next Tong tern inhalation study (CTR-118)
will be scheduled for initiation in March 1980, This date will depend on
completion of a sham exposure system with exposure modules , completion of
the comparative toxicity studies, validation of TPH © deposition as a
function of exposure regimen and evaluation of the prototype holders. The
introduction of an on-line computer to aid in smoke documentation,

safety systems, and data capture and analysis, will te made a part of the
SEM machines during the first year of this proposed long term study. The
introduction of this computer will not be addressed in this proposal.
