B. Distribution of Cigarette Smoke Constituents

1. CTR-108. Autoradiographic analyses of jung tissue.
a. Rationale.

‘Autoradiography of Tung tissue efter appropriate exposure
to radioactive:y labeled chemicals allows determination of the deposition
and distribution pattern within the lung. After exposure of mice to 14C-DTC
aerosolized in 2A1 or 2R1 cigarette smoke, we demonstrated that the tracer
was primarily deposited along the bronchi and bronchioles, with relatively
little tracer found in the alveoli (see Progress Report). Since this
technique has become reproducible and routine in our laboratory, we pro~
pose to extend these studies to determine the imnediate localization of

H-TPA generated as a chearical aerosol and 3H-catechol, generated both in

a smoke aerosol and as é single chepical aerosol. Data from these studies
can be directly compared with the iC-DTC aerosolized in swoke to determine
whether differences in the deposition and localization occur at the cellular

level.
b. Procedure.

Procedures for these studies will be those described pre-
viously, except that the RIB-3 gelatin cmulsion will be used for tritium
labeled chezicals. The length of time for theses exposures will be increased
te 2-3 months.
