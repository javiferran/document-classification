In addition, when the 1A3 cigarette was used in this exposure regimen,
no depression of the PFC response occurred under any of the conditions.
These data suggest that depression in the PFC response is sensitive to
type of cigarette, total dose of cigarette, both in terms of dose per
day and number of days exposed and the time at which mice are immunized
with SRBC.

A series of experiments are zhus proposed to more closely
investigate those conditions which result in depression of the PFC response
as a function of different smoke exposure regimens. These experiments are
outlincd in Table 10.

b. Procedure.

Procedures for these studic¢s will be as previously described.
All mice will be exposed to smoke generated on the SEH IT at MA as described.
Nice or tissues will be transported directiy to Dr. Herscowitz's laboratory
for asszy.

@. SRBC will be injected at Day 0 and Day 5 of smoke exposure for 5 and
10 days smoke exposure, respectively.

b. SRBC will be injected at Day 25 and Day 85 of smoke exposure for 30
and 90 days smoke exposure, respectively.

C. SRBC will be injected at times to be determined.
