2. CTR 114. Deposition and retention of eerosolized. TPA.
a. CTR-114-A. Particle size and distribution studies.
(1) Rationale

Particle size distribution of an aerosol determines
the site of deposition on the respiratory tract. Using methyline blue
as a stand-in for TPA, Dr. Holmberg of ORNL found the number median
diameter of 0.18 um with geometric standerd deviation of 1.8 for 1%
solution ncbulized at G°C. because of the high toxicity of TPA, a 0.2%
ethenolic solution of 34-TPA for nebulizaticn was euployed during
our dosimetry studies. Measurement of particle size distribution of
catechol eerosol (sec CIR-121) suggests thet the mass median diameter of
IPR werosel generated from 0.2% ethanstic solution, of TPA should be about
6.2 uc. This ray be ore of the reasons for observing Tow Teng
deposition during ate TPA cosimotiry studies. Hence the cctermination of
porticls size cistribution of IPA aerasol aco raetid frou 0.2% ethanalic
sclution woy be cruciz? to proper cvelugticn Gt our Gosimetry cata.

(2) Procedure

(3.0 um, 1.6 um, 0.8 um, 0.6 um, 0.4 un, 0.2 um, 0.1 um, and 0.05 um)

arvenced in series. Si-TPA irapped on the filters will be eluted with
