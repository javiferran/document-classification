The importance of this study, however, suggests that Dr. Wang continue

to attempt to characterize the pulmonary cytochromes. As deemed necessary
by Dr. Wang, MA will supply hepetic and/or pulmonary microsome preparations
for Dr. Wang's analysis. The study of the cytochrome P-450 content of
pulmonary microsomes following exposure to whole cigarette smoke will await
the completion of ongoing feasibility studies in Dr. Kang's Taboratory
(see I. Wang, Progress Report, 1979). When required, BO3F1/Cum mice will
be exposed to 3Al or 2R] cigarette smoke according to the procedures de-
termined in CTR-116 and 117 and microsomes prepared, stored frozen at
-70°C, and sent to Dr. Wang for cytochrome analysis. An example of the

protocol is as follows:
