Mice will be sacrificed at the following times after exposure: 0, 0.25,

0.5, 1, 2,4 and 24 hours. The following tissues will be analyzed for
radioactive content: head, larynx and upper trachea, lung and Tower trachea,
stomach, liver, bladder, kidneys, remains and hides. The data will be
presented as nanograms chemical per tissue per time point, with data for
