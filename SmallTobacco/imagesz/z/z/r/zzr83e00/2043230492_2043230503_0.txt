ELEMENTS MEMO

On September 5, Philip Morris USA will nationally launch
New Superslims from Virginia Slims. This 17mm
circumference line extension is an ultra low tar, low
smoke, 100mm product, available in both regular and
menthol.

The attached plan outlines the two month introductory
program for September and October with media scheduled
for September through January. Retail programs,
sampling and couponing will be concluded by the end of
October. Advertising, packaging and POS support have
all been designed to make a bold introductory statement,
while also retaining a strong Virginia Slims feeling.
