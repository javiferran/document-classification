they have actually tried it. The program will use the following
elements:

- Quality sampling by SR’s and DM’s utilizing sample
20’s and intercept coupon pieces.

- Quality sampling by part-time personnel utilizing
sample 20's.

-. In-store coupon delivery by part-timers.
*Note: All Sample 20’s and 2-for-1’s will be in a sleeve which

has a Buy~one-get-one-free coupon attached, as well as a visual
low smoke demonstration.
