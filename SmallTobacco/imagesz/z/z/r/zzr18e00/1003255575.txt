OBJECTIVES:

Generally, to develop lower tar and CO versions of present. brands.
Specificalily to develop a reduced CO MUL by use of the COD: filter.

STATUS:

A baseline POL (V-4835) is complete, testing MUL versus a reduced CO
version utilizing a high efficiency fiilter with low RTD(~1l"). The
control was overwhelmingly preferred.

A second test (POL-4309) utilizing the COD filter (RTD~3 and 75%
dilution) was rejected because of tar and nicotine analytical values
of the: experimental cigarette. Miicroscopic examination of the COD
filters of these cigarettes indicate leaking: and condensation of TPM
along the supposedly sealed plastic filter insert. This occurs in

a large number of the COD filters but not all. Evaluations of

hand made cigarettes utilizing) a new shipment of COD filters to
determine if this condition continues to exist is in progress.

A remake of this test is scheduled for this week.
