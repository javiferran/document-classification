Weekly Industry Estimates - Week Ending 10/10/86

Industry volume, 6,987 million units, was low due to payback from the
Special Inventory Maintenance Programs offered at the end of September
by Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds.

PM's share, 31.06, along with R.J. Reynolds was soft due to payback,
while the other four companies remained basically stable.
