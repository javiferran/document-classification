Dear Senator Finn:

Solving our health care insurance problems are going to

require far more difficult solutions than simply making

Minnesota’s tobacco tax the highest in the nation at the
expense of Minnesota’s businesses.

If Governor Carlson’s proposal goes through, one group of
businesses and consumers will bear the burden of paying for
a necessary and vital program. My only question to you is
this: what happens when those customers go elsewhere to buy
their tobacco and the state doesn’t collect the’ amount of
money it needs to finance this program? Where will the
money come from next? Who is going to make the decision on
who gets coverage and who doesn’t when the money runs out?

Customers of Minnesota businesses and most importantly their
employees should not be the ones who have to pay the price
because Governor Carlson and some legislators think raising
tobacco taxes solves the problem of affordable and
accessible health care. We don’t need gimmicks; we need
leadership.

Sincerely,

arte. Caw Orda,
