Dear Tom,

I sent Dr. Charles MacArthur, psychologist to the
Harvard University Health Service, a copy of the T.M.S.C's
Annual Report - largely, I mist confess, as an excuse for
asking him when the monograph he has written on psychology
and smoking was likely to be published, He did not give
me a definite answer to this question but he mentioned that
there was a proposal to have a Conference on 6th September of
those interested in the psychological aspects of smoking and
he expressed the hope that I might be there,

This ie the first I have heard of this Conference,
apart from a pessing reference to the possibility of one
being held, that either you or one of your colleagues made
last November. Would it be possible for you to give me som
further information about this and let me know whether you
feel there would be any advantage in either myself of someone |
else attending to discuss this - and, of course, other subjects
as well, a

As you may know, Alan Cempbell-Johnson raised with Mr,
John Hill, following discussions which they have recently had,
whether it would be useful for someone from Hill & Knowlton's
office to come over here in the near future for a discussion
of future policy in the light of recent developments in U.SeAcs

U.Ke and elsewhere,

Yours sincerely,
