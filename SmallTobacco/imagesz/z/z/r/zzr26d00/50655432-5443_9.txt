Expiratory Time Interval

FIG. #1. Comparison of age-matched normal (AMN) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subjects
with respect to expiratory esophageal pressure (Pes; A) and expiratory gastric pressure (Pga; B). @ and -—--, AMN
data; x and ----, COPD data. Expiratory time intervals were measured from the end of inspiratory flow (Vste) of one
breath to the beginning of inspiratory flow of the next breath; data are presented at Vste, 25, 50, 75, and 90% of
expiratory time. Analysis of variance indicated that group-by-expiratory time interaction was significant at the 0.05
level. Therefore, at each expiratory time, we compared AMN and COPD subjects by group ¢ tests. Statistically
significant differences were indicated by asterisks as in Fig. 6. See legend of Fig. 7 for definitions of other abbreviations.

sistent with the turning off of a very small degree of
expiratory muscle tone during the course of inspiration,
since the passive abdominal wall would demonstrate only
a very slight positive deflection of abdominal pressure
during inspiration over the same range of abdominal
displacements. In summary, the tracings shown in Figs.
9 and 10 fully support the utilization of our model for
analyzing inspiratory pressure generation and are con-
sistent with the presence of only minimal abdominal
tone during inspiration.

One assumption in our analysis is that the Pes and
Pga points at end expiration during exercise do not differ
from the RP. As noted in METHODS, Pes and Pga values
at end expiration during rest determine the RP. There-
fore our calculations of diaphragmatic and nondiaphrag-
matic pressures are based on the differences between the

TABLE 2. Electromyogram activity across TI intervals in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subjects

instantaneous inspiratory pressures and the RP (see Fig.
2). Accordingly, if end-expiratory Pes and Pga values
during exercise differ from RP, our calculations of Ppra,
Pram, and Ppgr will be in error.

However, since we noted that our calculations of Ppia
throughout exercise were essentially equal to our direct
measurements of Pdi, we conclude that even if end-
expiratory Pes and Pga values during exercise differed
from the RP, they would still lie on the Pdi = 0 isopleth.
While not affecting Ppra calculations, increases or de-
creases from rest in the tonic activity of the IAM and/
or expiratory muscles would introduce errors into our
calculations of the nondiaphragmatic components of the
inspiratory pressure vectors. For example, an increase in
tonic activity of the expiratory muscles during the tran-
sition from rest to exercise would cause our estimates of

Values are means + SE. Ti, inspiratory time; WR peak, peak work rate. Electromyogram (EMG) activity was quantitated by the amplitude
of a 75-ms digital moving average. At both 50 and 100% WR peak, we used a 1-way analysis of variance {ANOVA) to compare the three muscles
with respect to percent of Ti at which peak EMG activity occurred. At both work rates, differences among muscles were not significant at the
6.05 level, At both 50 and 100% WR peak, we used a 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA to compare the three muscles over the time of inspiration.
At both work rates, muscle-by-time interactions and differences among muscles were not significant at the 0.05 level. However, at both work
rates, the time effect was significant at the 0.001 level.
