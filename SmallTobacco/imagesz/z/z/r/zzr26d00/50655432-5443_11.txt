INSPIRATORY PRESSURE GENERATION

shown in Fig. 12, A and B. During the second half of T
(i.e., 50% Ti to Vste), Fig. 12A shows relative constancy
of Piam accompanied by a marked decrease in Ppra,
whereas Fig. 128 shows a marked decrease in Pram with
relatively less decrease in Poa. Four COPDs showed
patterns of Fig. 124 (with two manifesting a decrease in
Ppia to zero) and seven COPDs showed patterns of Fig.
12B.

We believe that mechanical (i.e., length-tension, and,
for the diaphragm, radius of curvature) factors largely
account for the inspiratory time course of Ppia and Plam
shown in Fig. 12, A and B. At the start of inspiration,
the diaphragm and inspiratory accessory muscles are
presumably at the maximum length that they manifest
during inspiration. In contrast, during the latter half of
inspiration, both diaphragm and inspiratory accessory
muscles have shortened, and the diaphragm has flat-
tened. We have recently reported that COPD patients
who exhibit EMG signs of diaphragmatic fatigue (during
treadmill exercise) show a decrease in Pdi during the
latter half of inspiration. Figure 12 indicates that all 11
COPDs showed decreases in Ppys either after 25% of TI
(A) or 50% of -T1 (B). In the present study, the most
marked decreases in Pdi (A} occurred in four patients,
in three of whom the EMG power spectral density analy-
sis showed signs of diaphragmatic fatigue (12). This is
consistent with the possibility that the combination of
diaphragmatic fatigue and mechanical factors accounted
for the early fall in Ppia in these patients.

In contrast, the relative maintenance of Ppt, in asso-
ciation with marked decreases in Piam (Fig. 12B) suggests
the possibility that these COPDs may have breathed
with a different pattern, one which preserved diaphragm
mechanical advantage relatively more effectively. Fitting
and co-workers (7) have recently shown that differential
fatigue of the diaphragm and intercostal/accessory mus-
cles can be produced by different breathing patterns in
normals, and it is possible that our COPDs may be
manifesting a similar phenomenon. Alternatively, the
pattern of inspiratory muscle recruitment in those
COPDs (characterized by Fig. 12B) may have preserved
diaphragmatic function at the cost of some degree of
“antagonistic” activity of intercostal/accessory muscles

such that the net mechanical inspiratory pressure (i.e.,_

Pram) of the latter was compromised.
