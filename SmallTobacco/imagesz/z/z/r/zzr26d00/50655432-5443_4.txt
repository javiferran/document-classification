Values are means + SE, Iso-VT, equal tidal volumes; Iso-Ve, equal minute ventilations; Iso-Pes, equal levels of mean esophageal pressun
swings; AMNs, age-matched normal subjects; COPDs, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subjects. At the lso-Pes comparison, th:
measurements for the COPDs are the same as those at the Iso-VE comparison (see text). Mean esophageal pressure (Pes) swings were calculatec
as the average inspiratory pressure swing across inspiration {ie., inspiratory time). At each of the four comparisons, group ¢ tests were used tc
compute the statistical significance of each comparison between AMNs and COPDs. In the AMNs column of each comparison, * P < 0.01; + F

< 0.001, $ P< 0.08.

COPD data at 100% WR peak. Third, for the Iso-Pes
comparison, AMNs data at 100% WR peak was com-
pared with COPDs data at 100% WR peak.

Qualitative Analysis

Pes-Pga inspiratory traces. Figure 5 presents the Pes
and Pga inspiratory traces for both rest and the three
exercise comparisons. Figure 5, A, C, E, and G, presents
AMN data, whereas Fig. 5, B, D, and F, presents COPD
data.

AMNs. Figure 5, A, C, and E, shows clockwise traces
with a fish hook to the right. The progression from A to
C exhibits an increase in vertical orientation; this sug-
gests that with moderately increased exercise levels, the
ratio of Paw to Ppa increased.

Figure 5G shows a vertical counter clockwise trace
with a fish hook to the left, and an end-inspiratory point
at an appreciably lower Pdi than the 90% TI point. This
configuration indicates that during late inspiration at
WR peak, Pdi tends to diminish in AMNs.

Additionally, only Fig. 5G shows that the point indi-
cating the mechanical start of inspiration (i.e., Msti) has
a more positive Pga than the RP. This latter observation
suggests that AMNs only exhibited Ppen at WR peak.

COPDs. At rest, Fig. 5B shows a clockwise trace having
a vertical orientation and a fish hook to the right. The
early portion of inspiration is to the left of vertical,
consistent with substantial intercostal-accessory muscle
effort at the onset of inspiration. A comparison of A and
B in Fig. 5 suggests that at rest, COPDs exhibit more
Piam. Additionally, even at rest, Pdi is significantly lower
at end inspiration than at 90% T1in COPDs.

Figure 5, D and F, shows counter clockwise traces with
fish hooks to the left and a decreasing Pdi after 50% TI.
A comparison of D and F in Fig. 5 indicates that F shows
a greater leftward inclination. These observations sug-
gest that in COPDs, the Pram-to-Ppia ratio increased
with higher intensities of exercise.

Additionally, Fig. 5, D and F, shows that Pga at the
mechanical start of inspiration (Msti point) is more

positive than at RP, indicating that Peer increases with
increasing intensities of exercise (F > D > rest).

Quantitative Analysis

Supplementary Table 1' provides the statistical basis
for our comments in this section regarding Ppra, Pian,
and Pper.

Determination of RP

The means of the individual subject’s Pes values were
~2.0 + 0.8 and -1.4 + 0.5 cmH,O for the AMNs and
COPDs, respectively; the means of the individual sub-
ject’s Pga values were 9.8 + 0.8 and 10.9 + 0.6 cmH20
for the AMNs and COPDs, respectively. The means of
the individual subject’s differences between Pga and Pes
values were 11.8 + 1.0 and 12.4 + 0.9 cmH,0 for the
AMNs and COPDs, respectively.

Diaphragmatic Pressure

Figure 6 presents Ppia data for the seven inspiratory
intervals at rest and the three exercise comparisons.

AMNs. At rest and at Iso-VT (i.e. 25% WR peak),
AMNs exhibited a maximum Ppia at 90% TI with <2-
cmH,0 decreases from this maximum to end inspiration
(Vste). In contrast, at Iso-VE and Iso-Pes (i.¢., 50 and
100% WR peak, respectively), maximum Pp, occurred
at 75% Ti. At Iso-Ve, the decrease from maximum Ppra
to the value at end inspiration was <2 cmH)0; in con-
trast, at Iso-Pes, the decrease in Ppia from its maximum
value to end inspiration was 7 cmH;0.

COPDs. At rest, COPDs exhibited a maximum Pora at
75% Ti with a decrease of 3 cmH,0 from maximum to
end inspiration. At Iso-VT (i.e., 50% WR peak), maxi-
mum Ppia occurred at 50% Ti with a decrease of 5 cmH20
from maximum to end inspiration. In contrast, at both
