INSPIRATORY PRESSURE GENERATION

Exercise Protocol

Our protocol consisted of a 6-min rest period followed
by a 12-stage graded treadmill exercise test (GXT); each
stage was 1 min in duration. During stage 1, the treadmill
was horizontal and its velocity was 1.6 km/h; during
stage 2, the treadmill remained horizontal while its ve-
locity was increased to 3.2 km/h. Subsequently, during
stages 3-12, the treadmill velocity remained at 3.2 km/h
while its elevation was increased at a rate of 2.5% per
stage. Hach subject proceeded through the protocol until
he found it necessary to stop or until the full GXT was
completed.

Statistics

All enumerative data are described by the mean and
SE. We used 10 breath averages during rest and 5 breath
averages during exercise to characterize Pes-Pga points
at various inspiratory and expiratory times.

For quantitative comparisons between AMN and
COPD groups with respect to measurements made at
various time intervals during inspiration or expiration,
we used a two-factor repeated measures analysis of var-
iance (ANOVA) (5, 17). If the interaction F values for
group-by-time interval were significant at the 0.05 level,
we then carried out group ¢ tests to evaluate differences
between group means (5). Second, we carried out a one-
way ANOVA to evaluate the statistical significance of
changes in pressures across inspiration (and expiration)
in both AMN and COPD groups (5, 17). If these inter-
action F values were significant at the 0.5 level, we then
carried out Newman-Keuls tests to determine the rank
order of the means (5, 17). Differences were attributed
to chance unless they were significant at the 0.05 level.

RESULTS
Overview

First, we present metabolic and ventilatory measure-
ments to characterize the exercise intensities at which
we will compare AMNs and COPDs with respect to
inspiratory pressure generation. Second, we present qual -
itative results of our model. Third, we present the quan-
titative results of our model.

Metabolic and Ventilatory Measurements

. All AMNs completed the 12 stages of the GXT; peak
Voz occurred in all AMNs in stege 12 and was 27 + 1
(SE) ml-min™.kg™’. In contrast to the AMNs, no
COPDs completed the entire GXT; all terminated exer-
cise due to dyspnea. The COPDs completed 6.4 + 0.8
stages and their peak Vo, (15 + 1 ml.min™.kg™) also
occurred at end exercise.

Figure 3 shows the relationship between VE and work
rate expressed as VO2/kg. Data are shown for rest and
for work rates that were 25, 50, 75, and 100% of peak
work rate (WR peak). Figure 3 shows that no differences
between groups were noted in VE-V0z relationships over
the range of VO; achieved by the COPD group. .

the exercise intensities depicted in Fig. 3. The AMN
group progressively increased Vr until a VE of 50 liters/
min was reached at 75% WR peak; thereafter, increases
in Vy accounted for further increases in Ve. In contrast,
the COPD group showed no further increases in VT once
VE increased to 25 l/min at 50% WR peak; thereafter,
increases in Vr accounted for further increases in Vr.
Comparisons between AMNs and COPDs. We com-
pared AMN and COPD groups with respect to Por,
Piam, and Ppgp at rest and at three exercise intensities,
The first exercise comparison was carried out at equal
tidal volumes (Iso-V), the second at equal minute ven-
tilations (Iso-VE), and the third at equal levels of mean
inspiratory esophageal pressure swings (Iso-Pes). Table
1 summarizes the %WR peak, Voz/kg, VCO2/kg, venti-
latory parameters, and mean inspiratory esophageal
pressure swings for the data that AMN and COPD groups
contributed to the rest and three exercise comparisons.
Some peculiarities of our exercise comparisons warrant
comment (see Table 1). First, for the Iso-VT comparison,
AMNs data at 25% WR peak was compared with COPDs
data at 50% WR peak. Second, for the Iso-VE compari-
son, AMNs data at 50% WR peak was compared with
