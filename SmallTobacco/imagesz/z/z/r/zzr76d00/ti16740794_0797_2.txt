("WINTER MEETING TAPE" RUNS 5:35)

ONE VERY GRATIFYING RESULT OF THIS MEDIA ACTIVITY
HAS BEEN TO BROADEN THE DEBATE OVER SOME ISSUES WE FACE. AN
EXCELLENT EXAMPLE IS THE MATTER OF INDOOR AIR QUALITY. WE HAVE
KNOWN FROM THE BEGINING THAT MUCH MORE THAN ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO
SMOKE IS CONTAINED IN THE AIR OF MODERN OFFICE BUILDINGS. BUT
UNTIL WE HAD PEOPLE LIKE GRAY ROBERTSON OUT TALKING ABOUT IT, FEW
IN THE MEDIA WANTED TO LISTEN. GRAY’S COMPANY, ACVA ATLANTIC,
HAS SURVEYED HUNDREDS OF BUILDINGS. HE CAN SHOW THE SKEPTICAL
REPORTER JUST EXACTLY WHAT IS IN THE AIR OF ANY BUILDING. ON
INVITATION, HE HAS EVEN GONE INTO REPORTER’S HOMES TO LOOK AT

THEIR VENTILATION SYSTEMS AND ANALYIZE THE AIR QUALITY.

IN MY OPNION, ONE OF THE FINEST EXAMPLES OF
BROADENING THE DISCUSSION WAY BEYOND THE CONTRIBUTION OF ETS TO
INDOOR AIR PROBLEMS OCCURED RECENTLY ON THE MACNEIL~LEHRER NEWS
HOUR. THEIR REPORT, WHICH I WANT YOU TO SEE IN ITS ENTIRTY, IS A
TEXTBOOK CASE OF HOW TO TURN AROUND MEDIA PERCEPTION OF AND

COMMUNICATION ON A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE.

KEEP IN MIND ONE THING AS YOU VIEW THIS REPORT.
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT IS MISSING. I'D LIKE YOU TO TELL ME

WHAT IT IS AFTER WE HAVE SEEN IT.
