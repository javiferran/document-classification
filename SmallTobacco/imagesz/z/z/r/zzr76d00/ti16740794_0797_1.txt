INTERVIEWS, APPEARED ON COUNTLESS RADIO AND TELEVISION PROGRAMS
AND GIVEN HUNDREDS OF SPEECHES TO BUSINESS AND CIVIC GROUPS. OUR
EFFORTS HAVE RANGED FROM APPEARANCES ON PROGRAMS AS DIVERSE AS
"THE MORTON DOWNEY JR. SHOW" AND "THE MACNEIL-LEHRER NEWS HOUR.‚Äù
WE ARE WELL KNOWN AS AN INFORMATION RESOURCE AND AN ADVOCATE FOR
THE INDUSTRY. UNLIKE SOME OF OUR ADVERSARIES, WE DO NOT ATTEMPT
TO PORTRAY OURSELVES AS UNBIASED, DISINTERESTED PARTIES. I THINK

THE MEDIA APPRECIATE THAT.

IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING ARTICULATE, INFORMED
INDUSTRY SPOKESMEN WHOSE ONLY TASK IS TO REPRESENT TOBACCO, WE
ALSO HAVE COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT ADDITIONAL EXPERT VOICES WERE
NEEDED. THOSE EXPERTS HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY VALUABLE TO US INA
NUMBER OF WAYS. NOT ONLY DO THEY APPEAR ON THE ELECTRONIC MEDIA
AND AUTHOR OPINION PIECES FOR THE PRINT MEDIA, THEY TESTIFY AT

HEARINGS AND PARTICIPATE IN LEGISLATIVE BRIEFINGS.

YOU MET (WILL MEET) ONE OF THOSE EXPERTS TODAY, DR.
LARRY HOLCOMB. OTHERS LIKE HIM, WELL VERSED IN SCIENCE,
EMPLOYMENT LAW, TAX POLICY, INDOOR AIR QUALITY OR SOCIAL ISSUES,
ARE ON THE ROAD EVERY MONTH. THEY CONDUCT MEDIA TOURS IN
SELECTED CITIES. WHILE THEY ARE ALWAYS IDENTIFIED AS CONSULTANTS
TO THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE, SINCE THEY ARE NOT TI EMPLOYEES, THEIR
CREDIBILITY IS OFTEN GREATER. THAT IS PARTICULARLY SO SINCE

THEIR ACADEMIC TRAINING IS FOCUSED ON ONE PARTICULAR AREA.

AGAIN, WE HAVE FOUND A HIGH DEGREE OF MEDIA
INTEREST AND ACCEPTANCE OF THESE EXPERTS. WE RECENTLY PUT
TOGETHER A SHORT SAMPLE OF SOME OF THEIR APPEARANCES WHICH WILL

GIVE YOU A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT THEY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED.
