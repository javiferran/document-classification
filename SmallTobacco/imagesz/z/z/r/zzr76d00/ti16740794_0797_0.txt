COMMUNICATING ON THE ISSUES

IN 1975, THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE DECIDED TO TRY A
LITTLE EXPERIMENT. OVER THE PREVIOUS DECADE, WE HAD BEEN
BATTERED BY THE MEDIA. THE SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT OF 1964 HAD
BEEN BIG NEWS. OUTISDE OF THE MAJOR MEDIA IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
AND NEW YORK CITY, OUR RESPONSE HAD BEEN MUTED. BUT THAT CHANGED
WHEN A GROUP OF INSTITUTE EXECUTIVES HIT THE ROAD AND CONDUCTED

MEDIA BREIFINGS IN A SERIES OF CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY.

WHAT WE FOUND WAS GRATIFYING. WE LEARNED THAT THE
MEDIA WERE GENUINELY INTERESTED IN WHAT WE HAD TO SAY. THEY WERE
HUNGRY FOR NEWS FROM "THE OTHER SIDE." WHAT THEY HAD GOTTEN
BEFORE WAS GENERALLY EITHER FROM THE NETWORKS OR WIRE SERVICES.
FEW HAD HAD ANY PERSONAL CONTACT WITH A TOBACCO INDUSTRY
REPRESENTATIVE. THEIR REPORTING ON OUR BRIEFINGS WAS GENERALLY
FAIR. THAT LEAD US TO CONCLUDE THAT WE NEEDED SOME FULLTIME,
PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATORS ON THE STAFF TO CONTINUE CARRYING THE

MESSAGE AROUND THE COUNTRY.

LATER IN 1975, TWO SUCH PEOPLE WERE HIRED. THE
NEXT YEAR, OUR COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE ENDORSED AN EXPANSION OF
THE PROGRAM AND TWO MORE COMMUNICATIONS PROFESSIONALS CAME ON
BOARD. THAT IS WHEN I JOINED TI. SINCE THEN, WE HAVE TRAVELED

HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES, CONDUCTED THOUSANDS OF
