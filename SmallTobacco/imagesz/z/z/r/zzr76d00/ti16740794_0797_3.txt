DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO

WHEN I SAID SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT WAS MISSING?

THE MISSING ELEMENT WAS ETS. NOT ONCE WAS ETS EVEN
HINTED AT DURING THAT TEN MINUTES. THAT IS NOTHING SHORT OF
REMARKABLE. IT INDICATES JUST HOW FAR WE HAVE COME IN

COMMUNICATING ON THIS ISSUE IN A RELATIVELY SHORT TIME.

OBVIOUISLY, NOT EVERY STORY YOU SEE, READ OR HEAR
ABOUT INDOOR AIR QUALITY WILL IGNORE ETS. HOWEVER, I BELIEVE
THIS SHOWS WE ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. WE PUT GRAY ROBERTSON
TOGETHER WITH THE MACNEIL-LEHRER PEOPLE AND WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY

PRESENTED ITSELF, THEY USED HIS EXPERTISE.

OBVIOUSLY, THE TI SPOKESMEN SUCH AS ME, BRENNAN
DAWSON AND GARY MILLER WILL NOT BE REPLACED BY GRAY ROBERTSON AND
LARRÂ¥ HOLCOMB. BUT THEY ARE A VERY WELCOME ADDITION INDEED TO
OUR COMMUNICATIONS CHORES, AS A MATTER OF FACT, AT THE NEXT BIG
MEDIA EVENT INVOLVING TOBACCO, THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST
SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT, YOU WILL PROBABLY SEE INSTITUTE STAFF
AND CONSULTANTS QUOTED. THAT EVENT, INCIDENTALLY, IS SCHEDULED
FOR NEXT MONTH IN WASHINGTON, D.C. BY ALL ACCOUNTS, DR. KOOP IS
PLANNING TO MAKE A BIG SPLASH AND WILL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY
ATTRACTING PLENTY OF ATTENTION. WE ARE WELL INTO OUR OWN
PLANNING AND DO NOT INTEND TO ALLOW THE STAGE TO BE OVERRUN BY

A GAGGLE OF HYPERACTIVE ZEALOTS.

THAT, IN BRIEF REVIEW, IS HOW WE HANDLE SOME OF OUR
PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS ACTIVITIES. IN THE TIME REMAINING, I WOULD

BE HAPPY TO TRY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.
