A ITuman PB-PK Model for Simulating Nicotine Uptake from Transdermal Delivery
and Cigarette Smoking

Speaker: Dr. J). Donald deBethizy Presentation Time: 45 minutes

Human exposure to nicotine can occur from tobacco use, ETS, diet, gum, nasal spray, or
transdermal delivery. A human PBPK model for nicotine and a major nicotine
metabolite, cotinine, was developed from a previously published rat PBPK model. A
novel forearm compartment was used to describe the blood sampling site in humans.

The model accounted for 20% decrease in nicotine clearance during cigarette smoking.
The human model predicts plasma concentrations of nicotine and cotinine following
intravenous injection, smoking, and transdermal delivery of nicotine. The model
suggests that tissue kinetics following transdermal delivery closely resemble those via
steady-state intravenous infusion. The human forearm compartment overcomes some
limitations when scaling a rat PBPK model to humans where the venous sampling sites

are different.

This human PBPK model for nicotine will be useful for examining differences in the
time course of pharmacodynamic responses to nicotine following the indicated routes
of administration.
