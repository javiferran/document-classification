Re: Distribution
Dear Bob:

Quite rightly, you people have been interested in the question of distribution
on Sir Walter Raleigh products as we plan Sir Walter Raleigh brand strategies.

The table attached, prepared by Laura Amshoff, provides us with
information we haven't had before.

In general, it shows that distribution is in pretty good shape on Aromatic
within those sales departments where the Spring flight will run. It also
confirms our belief that New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco

are disasters. Chicago is mediocre; Frank Sonego (Department Manager)
has already, on his own initiative, worked with me to develop plans for
improving brand distribution. His area stretches from central Indiana
out through Quad cities.

While distribution, like advertising, can always be improved, I guess, it seems
to me that our advertising will be reaching areas this spring where consumers
can reasonably expect to go out and find Aromatic at their favorite stores.
PKG's nicely designed promotion brochure will be a good aid for plugging

the distribution gaps where they do exist.

Sincerely,

dof
