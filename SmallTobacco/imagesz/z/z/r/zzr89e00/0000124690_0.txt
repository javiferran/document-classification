Backgrownd/ Rationale;

In developing a new entry for the low tar non-:neathol segment, several
concepts have been spawned, Substantial qualitative input has been
obtained, but quantitative information has been limited to a concept
statement test (referenee Brand Group Log #1 - 7/11/77). These
concepts ccver a broad range of product types. So that development
efforts may become more focused, an ordering of the concepts based

on consumer acceptance is needed. This ordering will use a methodology
which will complement tnal being done currently during the first stage
concept screening.
