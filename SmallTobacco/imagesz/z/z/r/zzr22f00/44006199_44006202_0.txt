Dear Bill:

The perspective (and follow-up) afforded by a week seems
sufficient for reporting, though not finally, on the results of
our effort last Tuesday at the National Press Club and the
announcement of "Helping Youth Decide."

The event was, as you know, preceded by a week-long period of =>,
“background briefings" with key media. The coverage based upone;. —
these briefings, the event itself and follow-up fall into two f°
broad categories. These are Print and Electronic. to

  

On the print side, we have verified the following:

The Lowell (Massachusetts) Sun ran the story. Copy to come.
The reporter was Tom Squitieri.

Gannett News Service -- serving 86 newspapers in 37 states --
ran the piece. The reporter was Pat Ordovensky.

Scripps-Howard -~ serving over 60 newspapers out of the
Washington bureau -- filed the story. Ken Eskey is the
reporter. A copy of this one has already been forwarded to your
attention.

USA Today ran with the story on the day of the event. As you
know from my backtracking, the eventual three-line item which
appeared in the National News section that day was culled from a
larger, more comprehensive piece done for the Life section by
reporter Barbara Zigli. The piece was deemed more national than
lifestyle news by the Life section editors and it was shipped to
National where it was snipped by Julia Wallace who is a national
news editor. No follow-up by USA Today is planned, although
Life editor Linda Kauss wants to see updates on program
acceptance, usage, etc.
