Contact remains alive at both NBC's "Today" show and CNN's "Take
Two." As you know, Jackson Bain of this office and Bill Aylward
from yours are meeting with Gail Evans of "Take Two" in Atlanta
this week. I. have asked Jackson to pursue his initial contact

with Ms. Evans during the course of the meeting.

No further

contact has been made with "Good Morning, America."

That wraps it up -- up to now, which is 10 a.m.

I'll be in

touch as changes occur, as reports arrive and as Detoit (the

city, not the Tigers) firms.

Sincerely,
