After your conference call last weck, I walked a copy of the Thai regs up to his office and
explained to Linda Speaks exactly what we needed (Doug was not in). 1 will call him as a
follow-up.

Thx,

Did you let Doug Blackburn know that ‘tar’, nicotine and CO are needed this year?
This list is tentatively due to London (Jenny Green) by 10/31/97, in case Tom didn't
mention it.
