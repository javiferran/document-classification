FRANCHISE CONTINUITY PROGRAM THEME

 

The overall theme of the Franchise Continuity Program will be
“pleasure Goods" to leverage Newport's “Pleasure” equity. Both
catalogs will feature Newport’s recognizable green and dayglow
colors, and visuals in the large brochure will be consistent with
Newport imagery - fun and upbeat.

NEXT STEPS

Please communicate the Newport Continuity Test program to field
sales in the Boston, Milwaukee, Providence (Massachusetts reps
only) divisions. A total of 1,932,530 S/F/A small catalogs will
be made available for distribution. This quantity is based on
redbook requirements for pack coupons, stickers, inserts and
carton coupons for the four month time frame (May/August). The
redbook allocation for the Boston and Milwaukee test markets is
850,096 and 1,082,434 respectively.

Placement of these catalogs is targeted for the May/August time
frame, or until supplies are exhausted. Actual allocation per
market may vary at your discretion based on the number of sales
representatives is each market.

Attached you will find a POS materials list, an item list for
both the small and large catalogs, and a timetable. If you have
any questions or wish to discuss, please don’t hesitate to call.

Thanks. Of?
