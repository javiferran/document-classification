The program will expire on August 31, 1997. Consumers will be
able to redeem UPCs for premiums in the small or large catalogs
up until then.

PURPOSE OF TEST MARKET

The purpose of the test market is to determine incremental sales
volume, redemption liability and consumer impact of a franchise
continuity program for a possible expansion.

TARGET AUDIENCE

Given the franchise nature of this program, the target audience
is Newportâ€™s current franchise of young adults, 21-34 year old,
50/50 male/female.

TACTICS

The following tactics will be used to implement the Newport
Franchise Continuity Program:

1. A S/F/A small catalog (the size of the face of a pack) will
be placed on both packs and cartons. The small catalog is
to be placed in all outlets. It should be placed on 100% of
visible stock as well as a reasonable quantity of back-up
stock (Sales to determine).
