discount/sniped promotional product will not be further reduced as these atready reflect a promotional price

maintaining your inventories on WINSTON $4.00/$.40 specially marked product and other specially marked .
product, you can continue to offer to your.customers a low price on these brands.

ConAsEmMehs”
Our naw pricing effectively creates two price tiers for our products, premium and discount. All brand styles
within each pricing tier (reqular/King/ 100/120) will be priced the same. We suggest that you consult with your
cigarette supplier or chain headquarters for complete detalls of price changes that may have resulted from
our announcement.

_ tls recommended that you sell through on-hand higher priced inventories prior to rolling back your retall
prices to consumers, We also suggest you reset your price for all brand styles in the premium and discount
‘categories at one time, thereby eliminating confusion for both stora personnel and customers. Instead of
trying to target a certain date, our objective Is that you have maximum flexibility In resetting your prices as”
most appropriate for you based upon your store's inventory situation.

We will not offer a retall participation/inventory protection program. Each retailer Is In the best position to
taitor its pricing strategies to fit its particular Inventory levels, and It would be extremely difficult for us to
audit the Inventory of over 300,000 retali outlets and offer a fair reconciliation of on-hand Inventory.

During the week of August 2, 1993, you will receive rallback point-of-sale materials to use in communicating
your new lower prices to your customers.

Thank you for your assistance in the marketing of our products.
