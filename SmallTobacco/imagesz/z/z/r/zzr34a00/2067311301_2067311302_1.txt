Joy,

| had a short discussion with Rick this morning regarding a potential internal transfer of Konstantin (Kostya)
Kozikis from Lausanne to Neuchatel to help us with scientific communications issues. All of us in Neuchatel
have now "interviewed" Kostya and are very positive about such a position for him. Both Rick and | agreed
that at this stage it would be of benefit for all, for him to come to Richmond for a few days to meet with a
number of other people in WSA with whom he will clearly have to work in the future.

Could you please try and organise some schedule for Kostya to meet with Roger, Hans, Gerd, George, Loreen
& Ken during a single trip to Richmond as soon as possible. In addition to Rick's staff, it would also be worth
him spending some time with the scientific coordinators (Willie and Bruce), and probably some of the
communications group. | will leave it up to the people above if they feel there are other people in their groups
who they feet he should meet.

Please let me know if you require any further information.

| really appreciate your help!,

with kind regards and many thanks;
Ruth
