Dear Mr. Wantland:

Several weeks ago we discussed the possibility of
your school district using the materials produced by
the Family C.0.U.R.S.E. Consortium. I sent to you a
copy of the booklet, "Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No"
and a videotape of the public service announcements
that would send a message to parents that you join in
the effort to eliminate youth smoking.

I wonder if you have had a chance to review these
materials that we are providing to school districts at
no cost. Assuming that your schedule gets no lighter
after the first of the year, I have taken the liberty
to provide you with a form to facilitate your response.
Would you please take a moment to complete the form and
mail it to me at the address below or FAX it to
202/393-4385.

I do hope that you will join forces with the
Consortium to help parents and other adults communicate
with youngsters about a variety of issues like smoking
that are influenced in part by peer pressure.

My best wishes for a happy 1992.
‘ Cordially,
