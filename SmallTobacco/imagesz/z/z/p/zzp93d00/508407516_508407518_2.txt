Systems Development - Mouth End Piece

Poly Development

Status: Four polypropylene and four polyester samples have been
received from KC. Also, two polyester samples were received from
Eastman. 10/10/20 mouth end pieces were made at 631 out of each
sample. Cigarettes have been fabricated with these MEP and
submitted to analytical for 50/30 total and puff/puff smoking.

Overall, a slight increase in pressure drop was notice in the test
cigarettes when compared to the control. Preliminary smoking
results indicate no significant differences in the yields of the
test cigarettes verses the control. Significance: The purpose of
the polypropylene test was to determine if a lower basis weight
would effect the yield profile and sensory perception of the XD
cigarette. The purpose of the polyester testing is to establish
material from either KC or Eastman that can be used to eliminate
melt back while maintaining acceptable yields. Timing: Ongoing
