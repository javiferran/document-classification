WEEKLY HIGHLIGHTS

PAPER SUBSTRATE FLAVOR

STATUS: AN ENZYME TREATED TOBACCO EXTRACT ON PAPER SUBSTRATE WAS TESTED
AMOUNG A SMALL GROUP OF SMOKERS AGAINST MARUMERIZED SUBSTRATE. ON THE
ATTRIBUTES OF CIGARETTE TASTE, AROMA, SATISFACTION AND PERFORMANCE,
THEY WERE RATED EQUAL. SOME NEGATIVE COMMENTS WERE, HOT TO FINGERS,

HOT AEROSOL , WHISTLING NOISE, LOWER IMPACT AND TASTE THAN MARUMERIZED.
TOBACCO EXTRACT MASKS THE PAPER TASTE AND EXTENDS THE TOBACCO TASTE OF
PAPER SUBSTRATE.THE METHOD OF APPLYING THE TOBACCO EXTRACT VIA A WATER
CARRIER AND THEN DRYING AT A LOW TEMPERATURE SEEMS TO BE KEY TO TOBACCO
EXTRACT ADDITION TO PAPER SUBSTRATE.

SIGNIFICANCE: ACCEPTABLE TASTE COMPARABLE TO MARUMERIZED

SUBSTRATE IS POSSIBLE AND HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WITH RELATIVELY LITTLE
EXPERIENCE AT FLAVORING THE PAPER SUBSTRATE SYSTEM. NEXT STEPS: CONTINUE
TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE TOBACCO EXTRACTS THAT HAS PROMISE AT IMPROVING
THE PAPER SUBSTRATE COMPONENT. TIMING: ONGOING

M-555 MARUMERIZED SUBSTRATE COMPONENT TEST

STATUS: AN IMPROVED MARUMERIZED APCC SUBSTATE PROTOTYPE WITH SEVERAL
VARIABLES RECEIVED GOOD COMMENTS FROM INTERNAL SMOKING AND FROM
MANAGEMENT. WHAT MADE THIS A GOOD PRODUCT ? AFTER EVALUATING ALL THE
VARIABLES SEPERATELY WE FOUND THAT THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR

WAS REPLACEING THE GLYCERIN AEROSOL FORMER WITH B-25 AND B-27 AEROSOL
FORMERS. PREVIOUS TESTS HAVE SHOWN SIMILAR RESULTS. SIGNIFICANCE:
B25/B27 IS A SUPERIOR TASTEING AEROSOL FORMER AND SHOULD BE USED AS THE
AEROSOL FORMER IN FUTURE PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT WORK. NEXT STEPS: INCORPERATE
$25/B27 AEROSOL FORMERS IN FUTURE MARUMERIZED MIXES AS A IMPROVEMENT AND
CONSIDER IT FOR THE PAPER SUBSTRATE AEROSOL FORMER. TIMING: ONGOING
