MENTHOL DEVELOPMENT (MARUMERIZED)

STATUS: A MENTHOL PROTOTYPE USEING APCC AS A REPLACEMENT FOR ALUMINA
RECEIVED GOOD REVIEWS FROM INFORMAL TASTE PANELS AND PERFORMED BETTER
ON ANALYTICALS THAN THE CONTROL. THE APCC MARUMERIZED MENTHOL SUBSTRATE
WAS MADE BY ADDING THE MENTHOL DIRECTLY TO THE MIX VIA AN ALCOHOL
DILUTION THUS MAKING THE PROCESS MORE SIMPLE. A HEAT SOURCE HAVING

K-24 AND TURKISH TOBACCO COMPLIMENTED THE OVERALL TASTE. SIGNIFICANCE:
AN IMPROVED MENTHOL PRODUCT WITHOUT ALUMINA IS FEASIBLE. NEXT STEP:
FURTHER INVESTIGATE CARBON AS A ALUMINA REPLACEMENT IN MARUMERIZED
MENTHOL SUBSTRATE.

MENTHOL DEVELOPMENT (PAPER SUBSTRATE)

STATUS: TOBACCO EXTRACTS THAT WILL GIVE NICOTINE IMPACT AND TOBACCO
TASTE IS BEING EVALUATED FOR USE IN A MENTHOL PRODUCT THAT USES THE
BAC PLUG AS THE MENTHOL DELIVERY SYSTEM. SO FAR 10 EXTRACTS HAVE BEEN

EVALUATED SEPERATELY, AND WORK TO COMBINE THEM IS UNDER WAY. SIGNIFICANCE:

MENTHOL YIELD WITH THE BAC PLUG IS SUFFICIENT WITH THE PAPER SUBSTRATE,
BUT THE TOBACCO TASTE AND IMPACT MUST BE OPTIMIZED TO HAVE A PROPER
MENTHOL/TOBACCO TASTE BALANCE. NEXT STEP: COMBINED TOBACCO EXTRACT
PAPER SUBSTRATE MODELS BEING MADE FOR EVALUATION. TIMING: EVALUATION
COMPLETE 1/31/91

ENZYME TREATED TOBACCO EXTRACT

STATUS: MOST OF THE TOX QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED. NO $NCREASED AMES
IN THE AEROSOL AND NONE IN THE EXTRACT WAS GOOD NEWS. THE QUESTION OF
WHETHER THE EXZYME IS DEACTIVATED IN THE TREATMENT PROCESS AND WHETHER
PROTIEN IS FOUND IN THE AEROSOL IS TO BE STUDIED. A CONFIDENTIALLY
AGREEMENT WHEN SIGNED, WILL ALLOW US TO TALK TO NOVO COMPANY TO SOLICIT

THEIR HELP IN MAKING THIS DETERMINATION. A MEETING IS SET FOR JANUARY 2824

WITH NOVO, TOX, LEGAL AND NTP PERSONNEL TO COORDINATE THE WORK.
NEXT STEP: MEETING. TIMING: JAN 28,1991.
