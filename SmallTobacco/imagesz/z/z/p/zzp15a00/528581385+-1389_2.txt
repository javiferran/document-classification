Additionally, for 1998, $26 million or $.24 per diluted share is included in ongoing
results related to estimated interest income carncd on assumed higher Ievels of cash
resulting from the previously described transactions as if they had occurred at the
beginning of the period.

On this basis, the company reported ongoing net income per diluted share of $.90 in the
1999 second quarter versus $1.38 in the comparable period last year, down 35 percent.
Net income in the second quarter was $98 million versus $150 million in the comparable
period, down 35 percent.

Ongoing operating company contribution (opcrating income before amortization of
trademarks and goodwill, initial up-front tobacco settlement charges and headquarters
closedown costs) for the quarter was $324 million versus $410 million in the prior-year
period, down 21 percent. Cash net income for the quarter was $179 million, as compared
to $232 million in the year-ago period, a decrease of 23 percent.

For the quarter, ongoing net salcs increased 34 percent to $1.91 billion versus $1.43
billion in 1998, reflecting higher selling prices although volume was lower. While net
sales increased in the quarter, operating company contribution and net income declined
duc to the combined impact of increased settlement costs, volume declines, and
competitive discounting.

RJR's operating company contribution continues to reflect the impact of tobacco
litigation settlements; the unprecedented 1998 price increases totaling $.64 per pack and
the resulting decline in consumption and shipment volume; and the heightened level of
competitive discounting activity versus 1998.

RJR's volume, excluding Pucrto Rico volume of 0.3 billion units, was 25.0 billion units,
down from 28.6 billion units in 1998, or 12.4 percent. Full-price shipments declined 12.7
percent and savings shipments declined 11.8 percent versus the prior-year period.
However, RJR's mix of full-price versus savings brand volume declined only slightly,
with full-price brands representing 62.2 percent of RJR’s total volume versus 62.5 percent
in the prior-year period.

Industry shipments declined during the second quarter 10.3 percent to 106 billion units
versus 118.2 billion units in the comparable period of 1998. Industry mix continues to
remain stable versus the year-ago period, with full price shipments at 73 percent in the
second quarter.

RJR's retail share of market for the three months ended May 1999 (the most recent month
for which data are available) was down 1.28 share points to 24.17 versus 25.45 in the
comparable period of 1998. However, the company noted recent share stability. RJR's
retail share in the month of March was 24.14 percent, followed by 24.21 percent in April
