RE: April 13, 1983 Request for Comment on
Possible Modifications in Cigarette
Testing Program °

eee

Dear Ms. Crawford:

Enclosed are the responses of R. J. Reynolds
Tobacco Company as requested by the Commission on
April 13, 1983. We appreciate this Opportunity to
comment.

We urge as a first priority that the Commission
immediately adopt a modification in methodology to
adjust for the new variable introduced into cigarette
“tar" and nicotine testing by "Barclay-type" or
"bypass" filters. The Commission's inquiry into
"bypass" filters has lasted long enough. It is time
for. action and results.

R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has not yet
finalized its position on Question 7, which raises
broad questions concerning "smoker compensation." In
passing, however, two points should be made on this
subject. First, no two smokers will smoke cigarettes
in the same manner. In fact, the same smoker will
rarely smoke any two cigarettes in the same manner.
Therefore, as the Commission itself has frequently
noted, it is impossible to replicate human smoking in
all its varieties. For the Commission to allow
further delay in adjusting its methodology for "by-
pass" filters while it attempts to resolve the myriad
questions related to "compensation" and human smoking
would be unthinkable.
