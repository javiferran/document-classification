Next Tuesday, April 19, the critic will launch its nationwide boycott of your
company in 25 cities, including Seattle, San Francisco, Boston, Minneapolis/St. Paul,
Chicago and Los Angeles. Although not specifically mentioned, we can infer that one of
the sites will be Richmond, given that the launch coincides with your annual shareholders’
meeting, Attached is an embargoed press release summarizing the effort.

The critic claims it will delay boycotting your competitor until Jater this year,
making your company the primary focus of the boycott at this (ime.

The critic is asking consumers to boycou what they perceive to be your company's most
profitable and heavily advertised products and subsidiaries: Kraft , Miller, General
Foods, Jacobs Suchard, Oscar Mayer, Post, Kool-Aid, Kraft Food Services, Jell-O,
and Maxwell House. Please note that many of these products (c.g., Jell-O, Oscar Mayer,
cic.) arc marketed to children -- producing a lie-in with the focus ol the erive's campaign.

Press kits containing bumper stickers, peudon sign-up sheets, company profiles,

postcards, and other background matcrial will be distributed by the critic. We expect Lo
receive these materials shortly and will overnight them to you this aficrnvon.
