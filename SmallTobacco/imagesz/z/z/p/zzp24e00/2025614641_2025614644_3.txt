If such an expansion is considered a few years down the road, we might’
want to develop in-house facilities similar to those at the University of
Maine. Additional equipment, such as a PFI mill for rapid reproducible
laboratory scale refining, might also be appropriate in an expanded
operation. In the near term, we have already developed the ability to make
different papers which can address many of our needs in the area of paper

technology.
