New Jersey Cigarette Tax Overview - 25 cent/pack increase

An additional 25 cent/pack cigarette tax would increase the state’s tax to 65 cents/pack and
make New Jersey’s cigarette tax the ninth highest in the country and almost twice the national
average (37 cents per pack).

Many studies show excise taxes -- especially “sin” taxes -- are particularly regressive in their
effect on modest to low-income people. In fact, a 1997 Peat Marwick study that households
that make under $30,000 a year pay 47% of all tobacco taxes. Without doubt, those who can
least afford the tax will be hit the hardest.

In 1991, when New Jersey increased cigarette taxes by 13 cents/pack, cigarette sales collapsed
by 12 percent. At the same time (1991-1996), Delaware’s sales increased by 15 percent. This is
a pattem seen in many states. People don’t quit smoking when taxes are raised, they simply
change their buying habits.

After a 25 cent/pack tax hike, New Jersey consumers could save $6.50 per carton on New York
Indian reservations, $5.50 per carton in Delaware, and $3.40 per carton in Pennsylvania. In
addition, New Jersey’s otherwise law-abiding citizens could save $6.00/carton by buying
cigarettes in North Carolina and $6.25/carton in Virginia. .

According to the National Association of Convenience Stores, many retailers, especially small
“mom and pop” stores, rely on tobacco for as much as 30 percent of their yearly profits.

It is estimated that New Jersey’s 1,700 convenience stores alone stand to lose $74 million in
cigarette sales and $56 million in sundry product sales (sales of other products) if cigarette taxes
are increased 25 cent/pack.

Gross profits, or the value added, lost to New Jersey convenience stores because of increased
cigarette taxes could be about $27 million or $15,800 per store.

The American Economics Group (AEG) estimates that a 25 cent increase will reduce New
Jersey’s cigarette volume by 93 million packs.

A 25 cent/ pack cigarette tax hike could lead to a $350 million commercial loss for New Jersey
that includes:

- $195 million in lost cigarette sales;
- $156 million in lost tie-in or sundry product sales; and

- $73 million in gross profits for retailers and wholesalers.
