- MEMORANDUM

 

December 21, 1982 ~

- Mr. M. I. Gastman
FROM: A. W. Spears

‘SUBJECT: Proposed Amendment
oo et, ft

~ Sometime ago, you sent me a proposed amendment
to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide - 8
Act to be introduced by Senator Stafford early in a
1983. me

 

AS I read. the amendment, it would call for the
full disclosure of all additives and contaminants of
tobacco and tobacco products. The disclosure would be
-in a form of a listing on the label. I think the
proposed amendment is completely impractical and unwork~
able. The disclosure list would be extraordinarily long =~
and probably would not fit on a label. I know of no
“product where such a complete disclosure is required,
_However, there are countries where limits are set for
pesticide residues, for example, and as long as the
limits are not exceeded, the product is acceptable and.
no disclosure is required. This kind of approach is
“practical, but a complete listing as called for in

the amendment has no practicality. I trust that:

you will communicate, as appropriate, this position.
