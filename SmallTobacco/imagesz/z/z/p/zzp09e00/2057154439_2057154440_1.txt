To facilitate evaluation one sheet sample can be made containing
the selected salt. Cigarette samples made with that can be compared
with cigarettes made from filler having the salt applied in the
aftercutting solution. If no organoleptic differences are detected,
the screening of other salts can be made by applying them in the
aftercutting solutions. This requires that the solutions do not come
into contact with any containers, pipes, or fittings of copper. or
brass. This eliminates the need for so many pilot plant sheet filler
samples even though we might eventually want to incorporate a salt

into the RL.

The attached sheets give suggested procedures to be followed and
analyses to be made in screening and evaluating viable samples.
