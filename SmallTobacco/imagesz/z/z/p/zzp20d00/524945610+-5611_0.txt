RE: Use of Brand Names on Matchbooks L.

Dear Mr. Blynn:

T now chair the NAAG Tobacco Enforcement Committee. The Committee has your
letter dated May 10, 2000, which responds to our letter of April 13, 2000, wherein we expressed
our view that Brand Name advertising on matchbooks violates section III(f) of the Master
Settlement Agreement (MSA). We also have a June 16, 2000 letter from Paul G. Gaston,
attorney for D.D. Bean & Sons, Co, We have considered both letters and remain unpersuaded by
your position.

The distinctions cited in your letter are irrelevant to whether matchbooks are
“merchandise” within the meaning of the MSA, As we previously explained, matchbooks are
“merchandise” within the meaning of section Ti1(f) of the MSA because they may be bought and
sold as commercial products and have uses other than advertising. Matchbooks do not fit within
any of the exceptions specified in section ll(f). Matchbooks are not Tobacco Products, their sole
function is not advertising of Tobacce Products, and they are net written or electronic
publications. Consequently, they fall squarely within the ban on Tobacco Brand Name
Merchandise imposed by section III(f).

Moreover, as we stated in our letter of April 13th, it is of no consequence that
matchbooks may be owned, made, and distributed by third parties because, under section HIG) of
the MSA, a Participating Manufacturer may not authorize a third party to “use. . .any Brand
Name in a manner prohibited by [the MSA] if done by the Participating Manufacturer itself.”
