The plain language of the MSA prohibits the use of Brand Name merchandising. We

ask that you reconsider application of the MSA provision to your matchbook advertising
practices. If we are unable to resolve this matter by agreement, the NAAG Tobacco Enforcement

Committee will endorse enforcement of the relevant portions of the MSA. Please let me know of
your intentions within fifteen (15) days of the date of the letter.

Very truly yours,
