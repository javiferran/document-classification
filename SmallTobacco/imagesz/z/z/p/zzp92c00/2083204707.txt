COLLECTOR'S CHOICE
VERNON CHEEK
Hi, Vernon,

As the Collector's Choice saga becomes more confusing, I feel compelled to document a
portion of it lest we become overwhelmed by superfluous details.

Originally, we were going to add Red Express to the Skyline Series of

C. Choice. We had agreed that the only change to the case UPC would be

the alpha letter "A" in place of the zero in code 1950. This application

of alphas would change with each new pack replacement in the carton series. (Are we
together so far?) Red Express was to be added to the Skyline Series. That, however, was
yesterday. Today, 11/24/93, Red Express is being added to the Vista Series (code 1690).
This change is being made because the Princeton University is being adversarial about the
use of the Princeton name on a pack of cigarettes.

As I remember our conversation prior to your vacation, this change from the full flavor series
to the lights series doesn't matter in trademark names. So it's perfectly all right for us to
switch the series in which the Red Express brand will appear. As I see it, this means that the
1690 code with now become 169A. This will represent the new Vista carton which will lose
Princeton and gain Red Express and so on and so on and so on.

This has been a great catharsis and you are a wonderful sounding board.
Hope you enjoyed your vacation.

Dee
