SUBJECT: PARLIAMENT MENTHOL AD/PACK STUDY - TOPLINE

BACKGROUND/METHOD

This memo summarizes the topline results of the Parliament
Menthol Ad/Pack research. A detailed report will’ be -
available in late July. - .

Interviewing was undertaken in twelve northeastern cit4des
among 404 menthol smokers and 102 young (18-24 years)
Parliament smokers who occasionally smoke menthol
cigarettes. The menthol smokers were broken out into the
following groups:

o 147 full flavor king size smokers
0 161 flavor low king size smokers
o 96 female flavor low 100’s smokers

The following points highlight the topline findings:

° With the exception of the female 100’s smokers,
Parliament Menthol did not appear to generate interest
at the concept stage. Specifically, only one in ten of
the Parliament and menthol king size smokers stated
they would "definitely buy" the brand.

° However, after trial, "definite" purchase interest
levels doubled among both the king size and franchise
smokers so that all four smoker groups exhibited
similar levels of interest.
