MEMORANDUM

TO: OR, I. W. HUGHES
FROM: TOM HUMBER
DATE: OCTOBER 15, 1982

Mike Scott is a Woking public affairs man and B.A.T represen-
tative at the 7.A.C. Because the T.A.C. is pushing to imple-
ment programs similar to those of TI ~ spokesperson, issue ad-
vertising, TAN = Scott requested permission to visit TI for a

briefing.

After talking with Scott and Bob Ely, I concluded that it would
be better for him to come here to get a more balanced view from
Mr. Wells, Mr. Russell and me. I insisted, however, that his
request for the visit be handled through the official channels,
which you should be receiving shortly.

I believe the visit will be useful to him and will give us an
opportunity to have at least one voice at the T.A.C. with a
realistic appraisal of TI programs.
