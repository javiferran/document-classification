RECOMMENDATIONS

The CAMEL Filter direct mail effort failed to generate increases
in brand awareness, trial, purchase, or attitudes. Additionally,
the program was not successful in reaching the target audience -
young adult male smokers.

Although increases were noted in tne awareness of the brand's
sponsorship of motorcycle and G. T. racing events, these in-
creases could most likely be accomplished through less expensive
means.

Therefore, it is not recommended that the program be repeated,
or expanded.
