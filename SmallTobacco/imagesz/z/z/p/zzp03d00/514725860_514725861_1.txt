REASON FOR NOMINATION (Continued):
The impact of these changes reduced the time required to validate the transfer efficiency phases of the program and
assess the fiber transfer from any XDU prototype from an anticipated three months to three weeks. In addition, this
degree of time and labor savings will be realized with each new prototype to be assessed.

Although the degree of savings to the Company is significant, | believe it is the demonstration of employee

empowerment and the willingness to pursue new creative approaches that revolutionizes our working environment.
Jerry, Keith and Guy represent a spirit of Innovation and they have molded that spirit into a significant benefit to the
Company. Please give this team your consideration for the well deserved "China Breaker Award."
