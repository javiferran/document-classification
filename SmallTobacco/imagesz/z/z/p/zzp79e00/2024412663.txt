A meeting was held at Park 500 on August 14 at 2:00 to
discuss the draft NPDES wastewater discharge permit received
from the State Water Control Board.

The following is a brief summary of the major issues dis-
cussed at the meeting. Any attendee wishing to correct or
add to these minutes should contact the author.

1. Phosphorus (P) is the only controlled parameter which
has both a mass (in pounds) and a concentration (in
parts per million) limit. Together, these two limits
Place a cap on our maximum flow. The P concentration
limit is fixed by state regulation at 2.0 mg/L but we
should ask the SWCB to drop the P mass limit or
increase it if we plan to increase our flow.

2. The question concerning growth at Park 500 and waste-
water plant expansion for the next five years must be
addressed immediately. Unless we request additional
flow in September, we will be committed to our existing
flow of 2.2 mgd. This will very likely prevent any
expansion at Park 500 unless another permit is negoti-
ated and possibly until more wastewater treatment .
capacity is added. State rules and attitudes and Park
500’s physical situation have all changed in the last
year. Three years ago we were able to start construc-
tion on the Bermuda Project without waiting nine months
for a permit. We will not be able to do that again.

It is important to use this occasion to expand Park
500’s treatment capacity if there will be justifiable
need in the next five years.
