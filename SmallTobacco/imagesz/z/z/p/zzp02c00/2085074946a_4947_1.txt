It's fine for distribution. In fact, the subject came up at yesterday's FDA Coordination meeting with Abby and Greg Wilson,
so | forwarded to both of them (did not mention whether it could be re-forwarded). It's fine with me if he does, but he will
likely want to get approval from P Desel, whom | also included on the distribution.
