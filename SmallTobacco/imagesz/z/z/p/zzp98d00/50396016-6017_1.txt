*University of Chicago (the so-called Chicago plan) from which institution he obtained a BS in
Chemistry in 1951 and a Ph.D. in that subject from Berkeley in 1954. After six years at the
California Research Corporation he became an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at Purdue; he
then went to Louisiana State University where since 1972 he has been Boyd Professor, holding
appointments in Chemistry and Biochemistry and membership in the Institute for Environmental
Studies. He has earned numerous honors and awards and has been on the editorial boards of
several dozen journals over the years and is this year the President of the Oxygen Society. He has
produced some 600 publications, the ones listed in this application appeared in journals
appropriate to the topic. He had a CTR award in the early eighties from which 11 publications
were produced.

BUDGET: The request is unremarkable and at $61,000 is a steal. The funds will be
used to pay the salary of a postdoc, Maria Salgo, who already has shared authorship with Pryor on
over a dozen good papers. Her own CV indicates she is an Assistant Research Professor at LSU
since last year.

CRITIQUE: After reading this proposal, this reviewer can imagine what it must feel
like trying to take a bunch of kangaroos for a walk. Yet in spite of its diffuse stream of
consciousness style, one knows that in the end Pryor will make interesting and revealing
observations; perhaps overinterpreted, but real nonetheless. By his own admission he operates one
of the few labs left willing to tackle the notoriously difficult problem of studying smoke
condensate, The beta-carotene-lung cancer relationship is surely an intriguing one, particularly
considering an alcohol vector.

RECOMMENDATION: On the net, in spite of this proposal, I recommended approval at

a payable score 1.5.
