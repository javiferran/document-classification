With the world such a changed place from what it was several years ago, we
feel that American tobacco, and Maryland tobacco in particular, have a good future
in foreign markets. If tobacco farmers can offer a quality product at a competitive
price, which we realize will be difficult, we feel tobacco will continue to have a place
on the farms of Southern Maryland and in the world's tobacco markets.
