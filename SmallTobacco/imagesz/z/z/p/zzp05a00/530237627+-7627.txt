If possible, I'd like to know if/when 'we begin to receive
calls from Lincoln, Nebraska. Since tHe video has the 8004,
the brand is anxious to be alerted that we are receiving
inquiries. (Something general, nothing detailed, but enough
to know that the call came from Nebraska as a result of the
video mailing.)

As a reminder, anyone from Lincoln should be given the
following "new" information about Eclipse:

** 80% Less second hand smoke

** No smoke off the lit end

** Virtually no lingering odor

** Practically no staining

** Price will be the same as other Full price brands in
Lincoln

T/N

Full Flavor 4mg tar / .2 mg nicotine
Milds 3mg tar/ .2 mg nicotine

Thanks for your help!
