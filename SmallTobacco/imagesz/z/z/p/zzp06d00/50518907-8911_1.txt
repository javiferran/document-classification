Materials and Methods

Drugs and chemicals Butaprost was a gift from Miles, USA:
M&B 28,767 was gift from Rhone-Poulene Rorer, UK. CHIPGE, (191
Ci/mmol) and PHIPGF,, (219 Ci/mmol) ware purchased from Amer-
sham (Mississauga, Ontario). Forakelin, soybean trypain inhibitor
(type II-S), acetylsalicylic acid, benzamidine, phenylmethylsulfony!
fluoride (PMSF), dithiothreital, adenosine triphosphate, creatine
phosphate, creatine phosphokinase, EGTA and isobutyl methyixan-
thine were purchased from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO). PGE,
PGF_,, 16,16-dimethyl-PGE, and lldeczy-PGE, were purchased
from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Radioimmunoassay kits for
cAMP and IP, were purchased from Amersham (Mississauga, On-
tario), and those for PGE, and PGF, from Advanced Magnetics
(Boston, MA). Fenprostalene was obtained from Syntex (Missis-
saugs, Ontario). All other chemicals were purchased from Fisher
OMontreal, Quebec).

Stock solutions of prostaglandins (1 mM) were Prepared in ethenc!
and stored at —20°C. Solutions were evaporated under 100% nitro-
gen and diluted with the appropriate buffer for use in experiments.

Animals, Animals were used according to the Protocol of the
Animal Care Committee of Ste. Justine Hospital. Newborn pigs (1-3
days old) were obtained from Fermes Ménard Inc., Quebec. Brains
from adult pigs (5-7 months old) were collected from a local abattoir
(Bienvenue-Olympia, St. Valérien, Quebec) immediately after sacri-
fice and transported to the isboratory on dry ice.

Surgical preparation for chronic catheterization. Newborn
pigs were anesthetized with halothane (2%) and the tight femoral
vein was catheterized with a polyethylene catheter (Intramedie PE-
90) for drug administration (Chemtob et af, 19908), The catheter
was fixed loosely on the back of the anima! using an adhesive tape.
The cathever and tape did not compromise breathing. Newborn pigs
were randomly assigned to receive saline. indomethacin (5 mg‘kg),
ibuprofen 140 mg kg), indomethacin plus fenprostalene (20 ng/kg
i.mu.), ibuprofen plus fenprestalene, indomethacin plus 16,16-dimeth-
YLPGE, 10 pgvkg ivy or ibuprofen plus 16.16-dimethyl-PGE, every
4 hr for a toval of 24 hr; these doses have been shown to significantly
alter prostaglendin levels (Tomlinson ef ci., 1984; Kennedy and
Doktorcik. 1988; Chemtob et ai., 1990b, 1993), At the end of the
experiment, animals were anesthetized with halothane (2%) and the
femoral artery was catheterized for blood withdrawal: animals were
then sacrificed by intracardiac injection of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg)
and their brains were removed.

Blood was also obtained from halothane-anesthetized adult pigs
through the generosity of Dr. David H. Chestnut at the University of
Towa.

Preparation of brain synaptosomes. Brain synaptosomes were
prepared by density gradient centrifugation as described previously
(Li et af., 1993). Briefly, brains were homogenized in 5 mM Tris-HCl
buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1.1 mM acetylsalicylic acid, 0.5 mM
EGTA, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.1 mM PMSF and 106 pg/ml soybean
trypsin inhibitor. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10
thin and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 18,000 x g for 20 min.
The pellet was suspended in the above buffer with 0.32 M sucrose,
layered on the top of 0.8 M sucrose and centrifuged at 20,000 x g for
10 min. The synaptosomes were removed from the 0.8 M sucrose
layer, diluted three times with the above buffer and centrifuged at

20,000 x g for 10 min. The purified Synaptesomes were homogenized
and centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 45 min and the pellet stored at
~80°C until used.

polypropylene tubes containing 28 mg/m! EDTA and 40 ugiml inde

with 15% aqueous ethanol followed hy petroleum ether. Prostagin
dins were subsequently eluted with methyl formate. The eficiency
recovery after extraction of PGE, and PGF, was >86%. PGE, a
PGF,, were measured by radicimmunoassay as described Previous
(Chemtob et al, 1993). The interassay variability wes 35%.

Binding assays. Binding of [HIPGE, and CHIPGF,, was p
formed as described previously (Li et af.. 1993). Brieffy, eliquots
Syuaptosome membranes containing 250 pg of protein were inc
bated at 37°C for 30 min in 100 yl of 10 mM sodium phosphate buff
(pH 7.4) containing 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl, 1 mM benzamidir
0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1.2 mM acetylsalicylic acid, 100 Ree
soybean trypsin inhibitor and varying concentrations of PHIPGE,
CHIPGF,, in the absence or the presence of 25 #M unlabeled PG”
or PGF,,. Receptor densities (B,,,.) and dissociation constants (K
were determined from the saturation isotherms using the Liga:
program (Munson and Rodbard, 1980).

cAMP and IP, assays. cAMP and IP, were assayed a3 describ.
Previously (Li et ai., 1993, 1994). For cAMP studies, ayorptosom
membranes (100 yg of protein) were incubated at 37°C for 5 min

8.0), 1 mM adenosine triphosphate, 7.5 mM MgCl, 15 =M creas:
