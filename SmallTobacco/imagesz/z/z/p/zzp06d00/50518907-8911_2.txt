synaptosomes were significantly higher in indomethacin-
and ibuprofen-treated newborn animals: the densities of
PGE, and PGF, receptors in the ibuprofen-treated newborn
animals were comparable with levels in adult ones (fig. 1,
table 2). The affinities (K,) for the receptors Were similar in
adults and in vehicle- and drug-treated newborns,

Effects of PGE, and PGF,. stable analogs on pros-
taglandin receptors. 16,16-Dimethyl-PGE, (a stable ana-
log of PGE) or fenprostalene (a stable analog of PGF...)
specifically prevented the increase of PGE, and PGF... recep-
tors by ibuprofen and indomethacin (table 2). 16,16-Dimeth-
yl-PGE, significantly reduced the density of PGE, but net of
PGF, receptors, and fenprostalene significantly lowered the
density of PGF,, but not of PGE, receptors.

Effects of indomethacin and ibuprofen on cAMP and
IP, production. PGE, increased cAMP production on syn-
aptosomes from ibuprofen-treated newborn animals to levels
even greater than those of the adult which are significantly
higher than those of the vehicle-treated newborns (table 3).
Butaprost. (an agonist for EP, receptors mediating cAMP
stimulation) and 11-deoxy-PGE, fan agonist for EP, and EP,
receptors) caused a comparable increase of cAMP in brain
synaptosomes of adult and ibuprofen-treated newborn ani-
mals. M&B 28,767 fan agonist for EP, receptors which
mostly mediate cAMF inhibition) caused greater inhibition of
cAMP in synaptosomes of adult and ibuprofen-treated new-
born pigs than of vehicle-treated newborn animals. However,
cAMP stimulation by forskolin and NaF did not differ be-
tween vehicle- and ibuprofen-treated animals,

IP, production by PGF. was greater in synaptosomes of
ibuprofen-treated newborns than adults which was signifi-
cantly greater than in vehicle-treated newborns; the PGF,
