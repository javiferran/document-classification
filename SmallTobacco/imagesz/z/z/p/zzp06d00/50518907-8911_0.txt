ABSTRACT

We recently reported that brain synaptosomes of newborn pigs
contained fewer PGE, (EP) and PGF, (FP) receptors than adut
tissues. In the present study we investigated whether this was
the result of down-regulation of these receptors by high levels
of PGE, and. PGF,,, in the brain of newbom animals. Newbom
pigs (1-3 days oid) were treated with ibuprofen (40 mg/kg) or
indomethacin (5 mg/kg) iv. every 4 hr for 24 hr to reduce
prostaglandins to adutt levels. At the end of the treatment, EP
and FP receptor density and receptor-linked second messen-
ger formation in brain synaptesomes were measured. it was
found that ibuprofen and indomethacin treatment increased EP
and FP receptor densities in brain Synaptosomes of newbom
animals to levels found in the adult: this up-regulation of EP
receptors was prevented by EP receptor agonist, 16,16-di-

methyi-PGE., and the up-regulation of FP receptors was pre-
vented by the FP agonist, fenprostalene. PGE,, butaprost fan
agonist for EP, receptor subtype mediating cAMP Stimulation)
and 11-deoxy-PGE, (an agonist for EP. and EP, receptors)
caused a comparable increase of cAMP in brain syMaptesomes
of ibuprofen-treated and adutt animals, which was significantly
greater than in those of vehicle-treated animais. Also, PGF,
and its analog, fenprostalene, caused a Much greater increase
in IP, production in brain Synaptosomes of ibuprofer-treated
than in vehicle-treated pigs. These findings suggest that the
relatively low EP and FP receptor densities in newborn pigs are
Caused by the high levels of prostaglandins and that these
receptors can be up-regulated by inhibiting prostaglandin syn-
thesis.

PGE; and PGF,, are major prostaglandins in the brain
(Gaudet et al., 1980; White and Hagen, 1982; Chemtob et ai,
1990b) which may affect cerebral metabolism (Chemtob et
al,, 1990b; Pickard ef al., 1977), PGE, and PGF, exert their
effects via specific receptors defined, respectively, as EP re-
ceptors and FP receptors (Kennedy et al., 1982; Coleman,
1987). EP receptors are further classified into EP,, EP, and
EP, subtypes (Coleman e¢ al., 1987; Halushka et al,, 1989;
Eglen and Whiting, 1989), Activation of FP and EP, recep-
tors increases inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) production
(Suba and Roth, 1987; Halushka e¢ al., 1989; Watabe et ai,
1993). Stimulation of EP, receptors causes an increase and
stimulation of EP, receptors mostly leads to a decrease in
adenosine 3°,5’-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) formation

et al.. 1993; Namba et al, 1993), We recentiy reporzad that
the levels of EP and FP receptors in brain synaptosomes (Li
et al., 1993) and brain microvessels (Li z¢ al. 1994) are lower
in the newborn than in the adult pigs. However, the mecha-
nisms underlying these age-dependent differences in brain
EP and FP receptors are not known,

Various receptors, especially beta adrenoceptor, are down-
regulated by agonists (Lefkowitz et al, 1990; Vincent et al,
1992). Down-regulation of EP receptors (Robertson et al.,

- 1980; Limas and Limas, 1987: Hashimoto et af, 1991; Vin-

cent ef al, 1992), FP receptors (Lamsa ez al, 1992) and
thromboxane A, receptors (Okwu et al., 1992) by prostanoids
as well as up-regulation of EP receptors by inhibiting pros-
taglandin synthesis (Rice et al., 1981) has been reported on
adult tissues. Because the plasma and brain concentrations
of prostagiandins, Specifically of PGE, and PGF,,, are much
higher in the perinatal Period than in adult life (Mitchell ez
al., 1978; Jones et al., 1993), we hypothesized rhat the higher
levels of PGE, and PGF,, in the newborn tight down-regu-
late brain EP and FP receptors and their signal transduction
systems. To test this hypothesis, we measured EP and FP
