Retained Solvents

Specifications for retained solvent levels in pallets of
wrappers have been tentatively set for the photo ionization
detector (sniffer) based on G.C. levels of 0.76 mg (Full Flavor
Low Tar and Ultra Lights) and 0.64 mg (Full Flavor). These
levels were set based on earlier sensory evaluation results.

Project PT

Several meetings have been held with Archer to discuss meet-
ing the new specifications for retained solvents. After making
changes to the black ink solvent, the lacquer solvent, and the
metallic silver vehicle, it appears likely that Archer can make
the solvent specification and minimize printing defects. Mois-
ture levels remain to be set but appear to be averaging 3.7%.

Successful Manufacturing trials of low moisture PT wrappers
were conducted this week. New wrappers using the proposed sol-
vent systems were approved by Marketing and Purchasing. Archer '
can now start manufacturing an initial run of five pallets.

Latest projected manufacturing start date to produce cigarettes

is March 18
