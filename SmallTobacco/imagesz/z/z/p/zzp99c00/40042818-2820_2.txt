and pathological circumstances. It is distinctly possible that the pertussis toxin
receptor is the ecto-ADP-ribosyltransferase. We are currently attempting to purify
and clone the PTR. We are using a variety of techniques including expression cloning
in COS cells and affinity purification using biotinylated PT and streptavidin-agarose.
We are also trying to see if we can use either NAD-agarose affinity chromatography
and/or a photo-activatable NAD as a probe for purification.

A major question we would like to address is the function of this enzyme. NAD
is normally thought to be present in very low concentrations extracellularly (although
it is interesting that we have been unable to find any published data for measured
concentrations of extracellular NAD). Therefore one can ask why an ecto-enzyme
would utilize a substrate that may (or may not) be present at concentrations below
the Ky for this reaction (= 8.33 1M). A number of scenarios can be proposed. Like
ATP, which is also normally present in low extracellular concentrations, NAD (and
therefore ecto-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity) may play a role in the normal function
of a cell; ATP serves as a neurotransmitter, binding to high-affinity purinergic
receptors. Conversely, NAD may actually be present in much higher concentrations
that previously supposed: we are now determining the concentration of NAD in a
variety of extracellular biological fluids obtained from a number of normal and
pathological conditions. It is also possible that NAD may be important in an
inflammatory response in which there is cell breakdown and consequent leakage of
intracellular contents, including NAD. We have preliminary data suggesting that, in
a concentration-dependent manner, NAD inhibits the ability of PTg to stimulate
tyrosine protein kinase activity in T cells, although has no effect on stimulation of
increases in intracellular Ca2+, Furthermore, nicotinamide, but not ADP-ribose, is as
effective as NAD in the inhibition, suggesting that this may not be due to NAD
glycohydrolase activity (which would also generate ADP-ribose) but activation of the
transferase which would generate nicotinamide as the sole soluble product of the
reaction. We are currently testing the potential physiological significance of this
observation in lymphocyte proliferation and function assays. It is possible that this
activity may serve to attenuate a T cell response in an area of inflammation and thus
be amenable to either experimental or therapeutic manipulation.

In summary, we have discovered a novel ecto-enzymatic activity in human T
lymphocytes that covalently modifies another plasma membrane protein on an
extracellular domain. This enzyme is activated by the potent T cell mitogen pertussis
toxin, but not by direct stimulation of the T cell antigen receptor. The goals of this
proposal are to understand the function of this enzyme and its substrate in T cell
physiology.
