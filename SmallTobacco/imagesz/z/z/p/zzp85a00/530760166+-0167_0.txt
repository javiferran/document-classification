Guys -
Tam not sure who to send this to, or who to ask for help..... so, here goes.

Mr. Johnston has received a letter, which was forwarded to me, and I subsequently
received a phone call from.... a Sally Wilson. Sally is an employee of the New York
Metropolitan Authority.

Where she works, they have separately ventilated smoking rooms. They have used them
with success for several years now. Recently, however, management said they were still
getting complaints, and they could no longer smoke there at all. Have to step outside.

To be candid, up front, I have to tell you that Sally sounds to me like one of those "what
have you done for me in the last five minutes?" types. Rather pushy, fairly humorless,
cic.

But, it sounds like they are really, really getting the short cnd of the stick if, as she says,
they truly have separately ventilated rooms and can't even use them anymore.

She wants our help. Ultimately, this one looks like it is an organizational/activist
challenge. Maybe someone should go to New York and meet with her. See what they can
do to help from an activist/organizational standpoint. Who do we have that works N. Y.
C. these days? If we were able to help them out, it might be a nice success story for New
York.

Frankly, if they already have separately ventilated rooms, and have now been kicked-out
of those, there is nothing - nada, zippo - we can do from a technical or ventilation
standpoint.

We can and will share our "workplace policy” information with her, Beyond that, if we
need to send someone there to satisfy her, I think we should. But first I think we should
