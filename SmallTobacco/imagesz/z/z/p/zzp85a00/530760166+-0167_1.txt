try to deal with her by phone, give her some help on organizing, ctc., and sce if we can
avoid a trip to the Big Apple.

Is there someone who can give her a call? If not, Ict me know, and I'll figure out what to
do do next when I get back on Tuesday.

Sally can be reached at (718) 694- 3711.
Thanks.
