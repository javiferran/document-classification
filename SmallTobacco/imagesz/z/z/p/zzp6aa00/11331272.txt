Dear John,

Thanks for your letter. I have reviewed Tim$ report as well as
Pat's latest progress nowt to me. You will find enclosed a copy of my advice
to Pat, I am very interested in knowing what antiserum Chick Turner used
for the CF test. We may need to use the anti-hamster leukemia virus serum
for all our testing. Positive results would be very provocative.

I am now in the process of arranging my charter flight to
California in November, I have obtained a ticket on a plane arriving
in San Francisco about November 10,

I had one idea which may make our meeting more convenient
fur you and at the same time enable me to visit NIH to get some supplies
and finish up some paper writing there. Is it possible for CIR to pay my trip
from San Francisco to New York ? I would leave the Monday after the
conference (November 15). We could spend one or two days together and?
then I'll go down to Washington, I can get a charter flight from New
York to Paris very easily but must make a reservation very soon.

If you prefer meeting me in California, I shall reserve the
return flight from there, Await your reply.

Looking forward to talking with you.

Have lots to share with you.

Best regards,

J/
