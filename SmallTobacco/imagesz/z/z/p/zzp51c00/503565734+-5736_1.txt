(i) If we knew what they hoped to find,
it would shed considerable light on the physi-
ological basis of smoking, including particularly
what. physiological needs are met by smoking;

(41) The development of strains which
metabolize nicotine differently (and with other
aiffering nicotine and smoking characteristics)
would be of great help in improving the animal
models CTR is now trying to develop for the
study of lung cancer, emphysema and cardiovascu-
lar disease;

(i141) The knowledge developed in this work
would be rapidly utilizable by other investi-~
gators with different interests, e.g. in brain
function, memory, recall, etc.

Accordingly, in Dr. Sommers! view, the animal
work standing by itself presents, at just the right time,
"a key group of experiments in the evolution of nicotine

and tobacco research."
