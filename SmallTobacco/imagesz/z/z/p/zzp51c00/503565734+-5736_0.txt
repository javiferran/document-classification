Animal Study at. Boulder, Colorado

The animal research program is described at
pages 22 and following of the overall descriptive mate-
rial. For convenience, copies of this deseription and
the budget for this work are attached.

Dr. Sommers describes the personnel involved
as a multi-disciplined team of behavioral geneticists
with expertise in modern techniques, including work with
the central nervous system, and with a background in

alcohol, In broad terms, their belief, with which Dr.

Sommers concurs, is that there is a strong Jikelihood that |

animal strains can be developed which will accept or reject
nicotine, so that the neurologic and metabolic bases of
this preference can be explored. With this information,
they would then hope to be able to do similar research
with respect to smoking, aS Opposed to nicotine alone.

According to Dr. Sommers and the other members
of the scientific review group, the team consists of fully
competent investigators, interacts very well and appears
to present the best opportunity to discover whether there
is a behavioral genetic basis for nicotine preference (and
then, perhaps, smoking preference) in animals.

As to benefits of this work by itself, Dr.

Sommers indicated the following:
