Many avenues for the investigation of the mechanism

of smoke formation are available with the TOF that

are not readily feasible with other mass spectrometers.
This is due to the fact that a TOF has an easily acces-
sible open source, and experiments can be run inside

the source. Many of the already proven techniques
mentioned below have obvious applications to our studies
of reactive intermediates in cigarette smoke.

a. Flash Photolysis and Flash Pyrolysis

Time resolved mass spectrometry has been applied
to Flash photolyzed reactions. Ketene and oxides of
nitrogen reactions, which we are involved with, have
been studied with this technique.

b. Vastola and Pirone have used a TOF system to study
the primary reaction mechanisms in the pyrolysis of coal.

Transient intermediates in the decomposition of ammonium
perchlorate have been studied using TOF.

Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry has also been extensively
used in detection of negative ions.
