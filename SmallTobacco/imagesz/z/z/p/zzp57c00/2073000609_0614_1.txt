VIRGINIA SLIMS / CAPRI

In Bakersfield, with increased promotional support around
the time of Superslims’ introduction, Capri has been able to
maintain its share level. In Shreveport, the brand’s share
gain is largely attributable to its B3G3F offers in both
pack and carton outlets. Currently, 37% of Shreveport

stores carry this promotion.
