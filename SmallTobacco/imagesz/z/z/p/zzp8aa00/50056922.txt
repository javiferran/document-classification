exhibited much artifact. Nevertheless small, homogeneous, membrane-

bound, intracytoplasmic bodies measuring 25 my. appeared fairly well

_ preserved (Fig. 2).

Transplantation Studies
Aliquots of the neoplasm were inaediately placed in cell-
impermeable chambers of the Millipore type (0.45 bo pore diameter),
which were implanted intraperitoneally into 10 male and female Wistar
rats weighing 150 - 200 gm. Two chambers were placed in each animal
in such a manner as to permit their approximation to the lateral
surface of the abdominal wall. A detailed account of this procedure
has becit reported elsewhere.
_Laparotony was performed at 4, &, and 14 days after implantation,
â€œat which times the contents of the chambers were transplanted to cheek
pouches of adult golden hamsters of both sexes, weighing 45-60 g. Suc-
cessful transplants were then passed into other hauster cheek pouches,
No host-conditioning was employed. Our method of hamster cheek pouch
transplantation has also been described previously, 21514
Portions of the tissue removed from the chambers, as well as the
cheek pouch transplants, were fixed in either 10% neutral formalin or
Zenker's acetic fluid, and sections prepared from paraffin-imbedded
tissue were stained as above for light microscopy. Several tumors
were also fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, and processed as above for

electron microscopy.
