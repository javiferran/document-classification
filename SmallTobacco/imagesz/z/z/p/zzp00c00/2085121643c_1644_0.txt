Gayle,

We are almost ready to update our important News section of the YSP
Intranet homepage. The text is currently in Legal and once we have received
final approval we will upload if. However, we would like to replace the

$250 award visual with the one I have enclosed. Can you help us with this?
Please let me know as soon as possible.
