The content of citric acid and of malic acid was directly related
to the quality of burley grades.

~5~

These acids were always higher

in the high quality grades than they were in the low quality
gradcs.

Burlcy contained five and one~half times as much citric acid
and a little more than twice as much oxalic acid as f£lue~cured.
The malic acid content of both was about the same,

The level of cach of these acids varied considerably from one
year to the next. ,

Within a given crop year there were sometimes large concentration

differences of acids due to the marketing region from which the
tobacco was purchased, |

Alkali extractable acids gencrally showed the same trends.as
citric acid and malic acid but the variations of the values
between grades were far less pronounced,

Malonic acid was found to be a major component, occurring to the

extent of about 0.4 percent.

Succinic acid was found to be a minor component, occurring to’
the extent of about 0.01 percent.

content occurred graduatly during the nermal aging of tobacco.
These ‘changes were not uniform and did not occur in a]l grades.

In only very few czses were there any net concentration changes
-in the acids after two years' aging.

.

 

In at least two flue-cured market grades, malic acid was inversely
related to hogshead temperature; i.e., malic acid increased as

the temperature during storage decreased and vice versa,

Correlation analysis of various constituents of

the flue-cured’

market grades of the 1954, 1955, and 1956 crops showed that:

There was a high correlation between alkali extractable

acids and citric, malic, and oxalic acids.

There was a high correlation between cit
