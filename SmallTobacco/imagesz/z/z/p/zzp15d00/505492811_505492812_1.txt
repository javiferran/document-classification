e Seven additional chemicals have been reviewed by the NIP Peer
Review Committee for adverse health effects. The animal data
were judged inadequate on _  trichloroethylene, a cleaning
solvent, to determine chemical toxicity. Epoxybutane, a
stabilizer in chlorinated solvents, was judged to have clear
evidence of carcinogenic activity in male rats, equivocal
evidence in female rats and no evidence in male or female mice
via inhalation. Ethylene oxide, an intermediate in_ the
manufacture of many chemicals, was judged to _ show clear
evidence of carcinogenicity in male and female mice via
inhalation. The NTP panel also included that there was no
evidence of carcinogenicity in male rats. Methyl carbamate
was not found to be carcinogenic in mice but was clearly
carcinogenic in rats when administered in water by gavage.
The NTP panel also reviewed two corn-oil gavage studies of
bromodichloromethane, a compound formed after chlorination of
water, and dimethyl methylphosphonate, a chemical used in
solvents, gasoline, flame retardants and antistatic agents.
Bromodichloromethane was judged to be clearly carcinogenic in
male and female rats and male mice. There was some evidence
of carcinogenicity in male rats, no evidence for female rats
or female mice and inadequate data in male mice after corn-oil
gavage of dimethyl methylphosphonate.
