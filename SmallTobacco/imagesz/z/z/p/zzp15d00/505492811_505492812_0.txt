RE: Corporate Center of Excellence in Toxicology
Weekly Highlights - Week Ending August 29, 1986

e A meeting was held with RJR Archer representatives to develop
sampling schedules and strategies for ozone, toluene,
isocyanate and oil mists. Employees are being exposed to
these chemicals in the workplace.

e Dr. John Kirschman will publish a paper on "Investigations of
dichloromethane metabolism and subchronic oral toxicity as the
basis for design of chronic oral studies in rats and mice" in

the November issue of Food and Chemical Toxicology.

e An FDA. Advisory Committee on Hypersensitivity to Food
Constituents has recommended an increase in research efforts
in the area of antigen characterization and the development of
an appropriate animal model, a reporting procedure for deaths
due to adverse food reactions to the Centers for Disease
Control, an increase in enforcement of good manufacturing
practices to prevent laws which exempt some ingredients from
food labels, and an increase in educational efforts toward
physicians, consumers and manufacturers regarding avoidance
and treatment of food reactions. The recommendations also
included the labeling of bulk foods sold in retail outlets and
to limit or phase-in the release of new food additives. The
committee also acknowledged the incidence of food reactions to
legumes which included peanuts and soybeans, seafood (accounts
for 5 to 10% of reactions in children), milk and eggs (10 to
25% of reactions in children, 0.1% in the general population),
tree nuts and chocolate. The committee also noted that
reactions to grain products are exceedingly rare and there is
no evidence that molds/yeasts produce adverse reactions.
