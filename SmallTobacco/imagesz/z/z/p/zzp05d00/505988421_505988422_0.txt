Subject: Brand Nane Protection

thie eunnarices recommended procedures for strengthening our
rights to the brand name PREMIER 68 weil ae for protecting other
brand nanes of current OF future interest.

1. Registration

The name PREMIER was regicterss with the U.S. Patent and
trademark office 6/17/60 and hae been subject to periodic
(annus) trademark registration maintenance shipments, with
the most recent 6/86. However, since (1) the name hae not
reached the marketplace in bona fide comercial use since it
vas first registered, (2) the name ie fo longer connected with
ite origina) project ané (3) non-use for two consecutive yeer*
dered prima fecie evidence of abandonment--there 26
some risk we could Jose rights to the name if challenged and .
have the (current) registration invalidated.

It ie therefore prudent that we reregister the PREMIER nance
with sufficient Gifference verevs the current name registracton
to warrant & proval © O.g+, © r-lower case versus & 1 caps

is a material difference whieh would justify veregistration.

I am coordinating this rocess with John Murphy in Marketing
Services and Guy Blynn an the Lew Departaent. .

This new registration will be constructively tied (internally):
to an ongoing progecs which is proceeding to market (1.€+,
SPA) and thereby strengthen our legal position relative trade-
mark rights to the PRENTER nane,
