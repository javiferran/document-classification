lewcaqaep ers isiz Ne eS ae Seeree would
sobably be manuteotared Ww bs KO VITSE Praent and should use
00% strip tobacco {(heeee NO O-7 OF 6-13) to ouppor’ its
preniua position and establich a meaningful and

point of difference versus other WRT c gerette branée.

 

Rationale for this preaiun positioning ie to maintain saximua
consistency with the SPA proposition, a6 well as to Gemonstrate
and validete meaningful comercial see of che PRENHIER nane.
Phie effort would be coordinated through Bennett Kopp and San
Finch in the Promotion Department, who oversees souvenir estore
operation. Phey would no be exposed to the SPA Projeny and
would only need to know we are protecting the name PREMIER
through the best available means. :

These same procedures should be employed to protect one to three
other names and partielty camouflage our interest dn PREMIER, it
de recommended that Monarch, Manchester, Alta and/or Altra be
considered for use.

A sample of the PREMIER (soft pack) wrapper ueed for registration
maintenance shipments is attached es daformetion. New graphice
would need to be develo for the souvenir store brand. he
®o14" diagonal pack design, preferably with a different color
echeme (e.9g-5 Gray background) and podified for a soft pack
oonfiguration, would be suitable for thie purpose. Some
advertising (@.g.+ & pack merchandiser) would further etrengthen
our position.
