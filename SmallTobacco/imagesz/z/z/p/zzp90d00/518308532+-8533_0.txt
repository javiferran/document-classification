HOGSHEAD CLERK PROGRAM

To stimulate interest and exposure for the new HOGSHEAD product in your
stores, we have developed some programs that can be utilized by your clerks,

Program One - Gear

For each clerk, we will supply a T-Shirt, campaign button and selling
brochure to be used to promote the product in your stores.

Program Two - Consumer Offer

For each clerk, we will supply 100 name generation cards to be used as
follows:

If a full price smoker will purchase at least one pack of HOGSHEAD and
complete the name generation card, the clerk, upon submitting completed cards to
his supervisor, will be rewarded for his efforts.

Notes

A. _ RJR is prepared to match a cash reward of up to $.25 for each
card properly completed and approved by either the store
supervisor or the chain headquarters.

B. RJR wilt be sending coupons to purchase HOGSHEAD to the
consumer who completed the name generation card.
