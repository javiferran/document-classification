TC 2.4 Particulate Contaminants / Removal Equipment

Main Committee Meeting: 1 attended the main committee meeting and can provide copies of
the minutes when they are sent out electronically if anyone is interested. (relatively little of
interest was discussed at the meeting) I have submitted my name for corresponding member
status on the committee

SPC 145P Laboratory Test Method for Assessing the Performance of Gas-phase Air
Cleaning Media

Main Committee meeting: Progress is slowly being made on this standard. Plans are to
complete a round-robin test of the method before the Annual Meeting. In addition, plans for
drafting part two of the standard (duct test of full scale media) are underway. ASHRAE has
not yet straightened out the roster for this committee. The chair has resubmitted names
(including mine) for voting membership for the committee.

GPC 17-P Sampling of Airborne Particulate Concentrations in Commercial and
Residential Buildings.

Ihave had limited participation in this committee meeting for the last year or two. At this
meeting I was approached by the committee chair and asked if I would be a voting member of
the committee (due to my experience/expertise). The guideline will describe sampling
methodologies, sampling strategies, and quality assurance for particulate measurements.
Many parts of the guideline are currently at an advanced draft stage. I have volunteered to
provide some documentation to the guideline committee in the coming weeks.
