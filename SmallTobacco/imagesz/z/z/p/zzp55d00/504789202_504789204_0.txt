Scientific Affairs

Additives - Ms. Joyce Dickerson from Archer asked that we
review the styrene/butadiene polymers used as moisture
barriers in cigarette packs. Dr. Deskin met with Mr. Don
Murray and Mr. Elmer Marsh of Westvaco to define the
information required for an assessment of potential product
effects due to contact with tobacco. Most of this information
must be supplied by the synthesizers who are major chemical
companies.

The Eastman Kodak representatives presented a s√©minar on a new
filter additive which is Supposed to reduce the tar to
nicotine ratio. The additive is an unsaturated fatty acid
which is added to the filter.

Product Contamination - R&D will analyze contaminated tobacco
for titanium. Before insurance claims can be processed,
quantitative data must be gathered which determines the
contamination level. The tobacco is currently being held ina
bonded warehouse. The value of the tobacco is approximately
1.2 million dollars of both finished cigarettes and
unprocessed tobacco. The improper type of paint was used
which contained titanium dioxide. The type recommended by
RJRT engineers was not used by the contractor.

Meetings - Human Research Review Committee - Approval for
evaluating the sensory effects of MESNA as a filter additive
and the changes in oral pH due to smoking comparative products
and/or flavorings was granted.
