inhalation studies.

-- Dr. Ayres is currently ordering equipment for the
inhalation laboratory.

-~ Drs. Ayres and Coggins and Mr. Bain McConnell discussed
the feasibility of designing in-house improved smoke
sensors to monitor inhalation studies. Bain McConnell is
studying several possible designs.

Biochemical Toxicology: (Metabolism/Pharmacokinetics)

-- A plan by which various members of the Division of
Toxicology could present informal seminars on various

"seminars" are designed to further our understanding of
other areas of research within the Division of Toxicology,
they will be open to other members of our R&D community.

Waddell at the University of Louisville to discuss
