TO: All Salaried Employees in Corporate, Research and Product
Development and Field Sales

FROM: Ronald S$. Milstein, Vice President, General Couns

RE: Retention of Records for Antitrust Lawsuit (Lorillard v.
Philip Morris)

 

Lorillard recently sued Philip Morris, Incorporated
("Philip Morris") in federal court in Greensboro, charging that Philip
Morris is attempting to unlawfully monopolize the retail cigarette
market through its "Retail Leaders" merchandising program.
Lorillard's lawsuit has been consolidated with similar suits brought
by R.J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson. Our lawsuit charges that
Philip Morris' Retail Leaders program violates federal and state
antitrust laws because it requires retailers to commit to exclusionary
levels of display of Philip Morris brands, preventing Lorillard and
other competitors from effectively displaying and advertising their
brands. The judge in the case has issued a preliminary injunction
that prevents Philip Morris from enforcing the more restrictive
provisions of the Retail Leaders program. We expect that our suit
will proceed to trial next spring.

As part of the pretrial proceedings, Philip Morris has
served borillard with a request for documents, and we require your
immediate assistance in helping the Company respond to this request.
Please review this memo carefully, determine if you have any documents
relating to the subjects set forth below, and segregate and retain all
guch documents until further notice. You should then notify your
supervisor and/or Jack Reilly, Associate General Counsel, Litigation
(extension 7703) about the existence of such documents with an
estimation of their volume (preferably by file drawer or box). Under
no circumstances should you discard any document that relates to these

subjects.
