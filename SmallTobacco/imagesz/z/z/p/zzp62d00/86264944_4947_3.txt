Documents concerning retailer preferences for point of sale

e
advertising, product display, promotions, and pricing.

We are mindful that Philip Morris has requested a large
number of documents and that complying with the document request may
prove inconvenient and even disruptive. We know that you appreciate
the importance of the lawsuit in preserving Lorillard’s right to
fairly compete in the marketplace and the importance of responding in
a complete and accurate fashion to this request. I want to thank you
in advance for your cooperation and assistance. Please direct any

questions or concerns to Jack Reilly.
