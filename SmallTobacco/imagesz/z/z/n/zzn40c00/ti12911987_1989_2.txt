INDOOR AIR QUALITY (TAO)

Indoor air pollution has become a major issue in some office buildings. The
widespread use of air conditioning and increased reliance on controlled
environments in modern office buildings has focused attention on “sick building
syndrome."

The answer to the indoor air quality issue is compliance with state/local building
codes and ventilation standards..NOT smoking restrictions or regulations.
Smoking bans or restrictions that are called “clean indoor air acts" are misleading
because they do not actually solve indoor air quality problems.

Lawmakers and business managers will accomplish little even if they succeed in
removing every last wisp of tobacco smoke from the workplace. Health
complaints erroneously linked to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) will persist
unless the true cause of poor indoor air quality - inadequate ventilation -- is
Properly addressed.

When it comes to poor indoor air quality, tobacco smoke appears to be among
the least of our worries. Reports by federal and private sector experts show that
ETS is a cause of discomfort to building occupants in just 2 to 4 percent of all
cases. And even those cases, findings show, can be solved with improved
ventilation.

In situations where ventilation is inadequate, serious health threats may exist
from pollution sources, such as office machine and furnishing contaminants,
chemicals from photocopiers, and sulfur dioxide from the building’s heating
system. Lack of maintenance of ventilation systems allows microbes, insects,
fungi and bacteria to accumulate within the systems and circulate throughout the
buildings.

In response to indoor air quality concerns, the American Society of Heating,
Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recently proposed
increasing its ventilation standard for office buildings to 15-20 cubic feet per
minute (cfm) per person - a three-to-four-fold increase in fresh air requirements
from the 1981 standard of 5 cfm per person.
