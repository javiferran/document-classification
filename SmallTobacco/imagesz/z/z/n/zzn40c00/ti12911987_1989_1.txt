PROPONENTS

Advocates who encourage the study of indoor air pollution and desire the establishment
of minimum standards for adequate indoor air quality include labor unions and
HRAE.

OPPONENTS

Groups that have opposed such legislation include building owners, developers and
business owners, who fear -- often mistakenly -- that the costs of improving indoor air
quality will create an overwhelming financial burden.

INDUSTRY POSITION

The tobacco industry believes that singling out tobacco as a major source of indoor air
quality problems is not only wrong-headed, but possibly counterproductive. Those who
suggest that tobacco smoke is a major culprit in indoor air quality, are ignoring the
serious causes of the problem. The industry favors sensible legislation in this area, such
as the bill adopted in 1989 in the state of Washington, which requires the Department of
Labor & Industries to study indoor air quality in state owned or leased buildings and
make recommendations for improvements.

ISTORY

Indoor air quality legislation is a relatively recent development. Between 1985 and 1988,
34 indoor air quality bills were considered at the state level, all of which would have
established ventilation standards. New Hampshire passed the first indoor air quality bill
in 1987, requiring restaurants to â€œprovide clean air," defined as meeting ASHRAE
standards. Since 1985, a total of 11 pieces of indoor air quality legislation have been
adopted at the state level. Three ventilation ordinances have been approved on the
local level.

So far this year, indoor air quality legislation has been considered in 13 states. One bill
has been approved in Hawaii, a resolution requiring the Office of State Planning in
conjunction with the Department of Health to report to the legislature on various
environmental matters including indoor air quality.
