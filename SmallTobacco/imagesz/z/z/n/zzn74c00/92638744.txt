MEMORANDUM

August 21, 1995

TOs K. Paitakis
FROM: A. Sadovnick

SUBJECT: PHONE CARD SUPPLIER

As discussed, Schneider Communications, our phone card supplier,
was acquired by Frontier Communications on August 8, 1995.
Frontier then merged with ALC on August 16, 1995. The new
company has a market value of $4.3 biltion, according to the
attached newsletter.

The implication of this merger relative to our promotions on
Kent, True, and Style is simply, that we are now dealing with a
much larger supplier. Geri Matzke has assured me there will be
no changes in pricing or any delay in implementing the program
due to this merger.

Frontier Communications is an original provider of telephone
time, as well as the fifth largest long distance carrier in the
U.S. (see attached letter).

Please issue the revised purchase order to Frontier.
