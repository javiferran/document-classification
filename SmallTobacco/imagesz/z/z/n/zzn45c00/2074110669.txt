S.B. 55.

Attached is the version of S.B. 55 approved by the Senate Health & Human Services
Committee. It is an improvement over the original bill that you reviewed previously.
Deleted is the ban on outdoor advertising and the provision that would have prohibited an
adult consumer from redeeming a coupon in a face-to-face transaction. Also,
administration has been moved from the Department of Health to the State Comptroller’s
office, which is a much better agency for enforcement of this law.

This bill, however, still has two major problems:

1) Aself-serve ban. ,

2) A 10% tax on outdoor tobacco advertising to pay for a tobacco education media
campaign plus expanding the state’s current outdoor advertising ban from 500 to 1,000 feet
from a church or school.

The bill also has the 27 year old carding requirement.

Please review this latest version and let me know if you identify other major concerns that
we need to address.

Thanks.
