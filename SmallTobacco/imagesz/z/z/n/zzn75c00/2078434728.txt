Craig is going to put together the blends from Leaf that will be used in the Mat filler
processing the week of 3-6-00 in SW. Please let him know how much of this tobacco
will be needed for testing. | will deliver it to one of you the first of next week. |
understand that it takes 3 weeks for Lancaster to analyze the tobacco, but you will
need to decide where the testing should be performed and how much is needed
based on this decision. Craig needs this info ASAP. Thanks.
