removed, the room can be cleaned up. We should need only three days during
this week.

Because this is the first time for doing this procedure, I recommend
the following actions:

Notify the ERT teams in OC and R&D North Complex the day we are to do
the spraying. (Dick Howe/Linda Guinn)

Notify medical (nurses). (Dick Howe/Linda Guinn)

Spray a control first, ethanol, monitor for leaks and assess the
procedure before using nicotine the first time.

Criticize the procedure after all the currently scheduled sprayings are
done and re-write, if necessary, to provide the best information for
future reference.

Please let me know if these plans and the Job Procedure meet with your
approval.
