Subject: . Sample Inventory Procedure
Cheryl,

â€˜Thanks for giving me.a copy of your memo on a procedure for sample inventory control. | dort know ff your
thoughts will have been influenced by your trip to Lancaster Labs by the time you get this email. Your plan definitely cuts
through the clutter on finding samples from the current season. One question | have is how will we handle future sample
consolidation. That is, as a few seasons pass we may want to consolidate a limited number of samples from the past-for
example, high TSNA samples resulting from a special curing program-into a new location. Would we then need to prepare
anew sample label with a new location code?
