Subject: RE: We Card Trademark

Coalition is saying no need to include the "R in circle" at all at this time. The words, "We Card" are
not what was trademarked but instead, the entire visual with wording "Under 18 - No Tobacco -- We
Card".

In the meantime, the Coalition will undertake to include the "R in cirlce‚Äù directly on the materials they
produce.
