Dear Mr. White,

Re: Your study on Passive Smceke

, New England Journal of Medicine.
It ig indeed heartening that at long last scientific evicence is

-available to show the harmful effects of passive smoke on non smokers.

We have done vesearch on less harmful effects of cigarettes for
the non smoker and the smoker himself for over 20 years, The results
of our research have produced a number of patents which have a major
effect of reducing the sidestream smoke to almost zero, thus removing
_the very dangers to the lungs of the non smoker. . Live

You -have stated "I think the protection of human health is very
important. I'm one who really detests legislation, but I wouldn't
have any idea how to protect non smokers without some type | of
legislation", “We have this answer.

Our developments in this area are based on coating the cigarette
paperwith a well known, safe compound which has been docunented over
the years to be clear, tasteless, odorless, inert, non carcinogenic
and non allergenic, releasing only & small amount of water vapor into
the smoke stream. - -

The applied compound forma an insulating cover over the puraing |
eal which, in turn, slowa the burning rate of the cigarette between
puffs, without interfering with the quantity, quality and taste of the
puff,

The state of California has tested our cigarette development for
its properties of fire resistance, Enclosed is a copy of their report.

The Department of Hoalth, Education and Welfare tested an oarlier
version of our ohcoretre devolopment with test results showing about
20% less "tars", nicotine and carbon monoxide in the mainstream amoke
and about 60% 1 leas “tars", nicotine and certain gases in the sidostream
smoke. See enclosad result s of their report,
