Menthol:

Project Levo: No change.

A menthol action plan will be discussed to test all major menthol
brands currently on the market for subjective equivalency between
Synthetic and Brazilian Menthol. Next, we will subjectively evaluate
100% Synthetic Menthol plasticizer for price value products. If
successful, convert price value products to 100% synthetic plasticizer.
Finally, the plan is to evaluate 100% synthetic menthol plasticizer for
full value products and convert full value products to 100% synthetic
plasticizer if subjectives are acceptable.

Marlboro Menthol:
Cigarettes have been made with Marlboro Menthol filler and specs for

removal of MPZ in the filter. Cigarettes will be smoked after
menthol equilibration and CI data is received.

Project De-Nic:

Flavor work is in continuation on De-Nic blanks.

Filter Flavor Activity: No Activity.

PM WEb: No Activity. -
