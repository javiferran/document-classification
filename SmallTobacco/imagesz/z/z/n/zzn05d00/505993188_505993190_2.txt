At the request of Operations Development, an
evaluation of 1100 (3/4 hard and full hard) aluminum
capsules and 3003 aluminum capsules was initiated.
Instron compression test data at 25 mm/sec indicated
that the insertion load for baked or green fuel
sources was 8 kg. Under the same test conditions,
the 1100 aluminum capsules start to collapse at 12 kg
(3/4 hard) and 13 kg (full hard). The 3003 aluminum
capsules started to collapse at 14 to 15 kg. These
results indicate that all three capsules should

adequately withstand the insertion load without
collapse.

Models are being made for puff by puff deliveries and
for corrosion evaluation.
