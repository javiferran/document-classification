15. “Application of cytogenetic methods to analysis of etio-
logic factors in carcinogenesis" F. Mitelman, Lund, Sweden.
Though little is known about the significance of all the changes
in chromosomes in carcinogenesis, some conclusions can be drawn
from the latest evidence. All tumors that have been studied in
sufficient numbers show strictly nonrandom chromosome patterns.
In some instances, some aberrations are very specific and highly
consistent, as in certain forms of leukemia.

Chromosomes 1, 8 and 14 are important in at least seven dis-
orders each. Also, chromosome aberrations in various tumor types
seem to be influenced by geography, external factors and the
etiology of the tumor.

16. “Urinary mutagenicity assay in identifying individuals
with exposure to genotoxicants in the rubber industry" -- H.
Vainio, Helsinki. The assays were used to estimate different lev~
els of exposure for workers in various jobs in the rubber in-
dustry.

The mutagenic acitivity was due to occupational exposure,
Vainio said, because workers returning from a month's vacation
showed no mutagenic activity in their urime. Smoking acts syn-
ergistically with exposure to rubber compounds because those workers
who smoked had the highest mitagenicity.

Vainio said the test might be used to identify previously

unsuspected chemicals long before their harmful effects become ap—
parent in continuously exposed workers.
