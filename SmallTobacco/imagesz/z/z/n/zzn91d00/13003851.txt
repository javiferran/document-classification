Dear Marcel

Identification of Fake Viceroy Products

I am frequently called on to identify products that have either been scized by HK Customs and
Excise Dept. and our sales people in China. Sometimes this is easy when it is a bad fake but

the fake manufacturers are becoming more sophisticated as they earn mo: invest
satne of this in better products. me money and

   
 
 
   
   

One of the things that I have noticed is that there appears to be 2 different styles of die print on
Viceroy KS cigarettes (Large Shield design). One print font has serif and a hook on the
descending limb of the “R" the other print style has no (very small) serifs, by comparison. Ail
other aspects of the packaging and cigarettes seem genuine to me.

See eel if you would confirm to me whether you are or have besn running two
erent dic print styles on export Viceroy KS. If yes, do you plan to continue this practi
standardise on one style? pian mae ot

If you have only one print style, are other companies authorised by B&W to manufacture
Large Shicid KS Box and SC with a different dic print? My thinking is that it could be a

parallel product that is leaking into the market.
