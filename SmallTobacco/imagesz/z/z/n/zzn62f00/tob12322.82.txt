Dear Board Members:

I recently read your booklet "Helping Youth Decide" and found
it to be a wonderful resource not only for parents but for leaders
who work with youth involving decision-making programs.

Our Council serves 13 counties in North Carolina, approximately
15,000 girls and adults. We offer a full-time adult development
training program for our volunteers to help them work with girls.
Your booklet would be a good resource for us to have in our train-
ing library.

How do I go about securi 50 copies of this booklet? Please
inform me as to how to order, 7 etc.

Thank you for your help and support for Giri Scouting.

Sincerely,
