adhesion over the vector controls (Fig. 6, Bar Graph). Thus MacMARCKS is essential for B2 integrin
activation. Similar results was also obtained with humna monocytic cells, U937.

6. MacMARCKS is in the complex with FAK and Paxillin.

We then continued to examine the mechanism of how MacMARCKS regulates integrin
activation. We examined the proteins that associated with MacMARCKS in vivo. From 35S-Methionine
metabolically labeled cell lysate, we found that two proteins were specifically coimmunoprecipitated

with MacMARCKS by anti-MacMARCKS antibody, compared with
preimmune serum (Fig. 7, left). The two proteins, with apparent molecular
3 weight of 68 kDa and 125 kDa, were proven to be Paxillin and FAK after
é aioe coimmunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting (Fig. 7, right). Both

be significant for integrin activation. We are currently examining whether
there is direct interaction between these proteins.

Discussion:

With the support from The Council for Tobacco Research, we have shown that MacMARCKS
is essential for B2 integrin activation and MacMARCKS regulates phagocytosis through its control of B2
integrin. It is the first time that a PKC substrate is shown to be essential for B2 integrin activation, and
the first time for MacMARCKS to be assigned a cellular function. We also discovered that FAK and
Paxillin can form complex with MacMARCKS in vivo. This is a major step forward in understanding the
signal transduction pathway of integrin activation and the role of PKC in this pathway.

Now with the system in hand, we can begin to addressed a number of questions immediately.
First, is the phosphorylation of MacMARCKS an essential step for the activation of integrin? We can
address such a question by using the non-phosphoylatable and pseudophosphorylated MacMARCKS
mutants. Second, how is the signal transduced from MacMARCKS to integrin? Is the signal transduced
through a third party or parties, probably FAK and paxillin, which we have shown to be complexed with
MacMARCKS? Third question is whether MacMARCKS is also required for other cell types, such as

T cell activation and migration where the B2 integrin family (LFA-1) plays important role (15).
These questions should be addressed during the second half of the grant support from The
Council For Tobacco Research.
