1. Characterize the F-actin organization in 3774 cells expressing effector domain deletion
mutant of MacMARCKS (ED).

1.1. Examine the ligand-induced F-actin formation in ED mutant expressing J774 cells.

1.2. Examine the effect of MacMARCKS mutants on the association of F-actin with phagosome.

2. Examine the effects of PKC-mediated phosphorylation of MacMARCKS.

2.1. Examine MacMARCKS phosphrlation diring macorphage phagocytosis.

2.2. Examine the effects of phosphorylation of MacMARCKS on macrophage phagocytosis.

2.3. Examine the effects of MacMARCKS phosphorylation on the phagosomal association of
MacMARCKS and on F-actin localization to phagosomes.

2.4. Transfect MacMARCKS into Fe and Complement receptor expressing fibroblast
