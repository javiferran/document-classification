MEMORANDUM

TO: Cc. E. SMOOT
FROM: Db. E. SPANGLER
DATE: August 17, 1979

SUBJECT: Lites/Brigade

Charlie, I apologize for the time it has taken me to got back on
Ray Allen'a suggestions for Lites and i Brigade as potential new
’ brand entries.

‘We eagily found that Philip Morris had us blocked from using
‘Brigade as a brand. It took us longer to determine that there
are three different "Lites" variations which would block our

e usage as a brand name.

 

‘Although the brands cannot be used, I have asked one of the
creative groupe to determine (f the Lites concept maked sense
from a creative standpoint using a brand that has rub-off value.

if this has merit, I'll let you know.

D. E. 8.
