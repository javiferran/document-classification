apparent mean open time apparently does decrease after SP exposure
(figure 6A). When the effects of SP on these parameters were pooled
from 8 experiments, SP significantly decreased the opening frequency
and mean open time of ACh-activated single channel currents without
altering the single channel current amplitude of both S and M channel
types.

Figure 6. SP decreases the opening frequency and open time of AChR channels
without altering single channel current amplitude.

A. Raw data sweeps before and after presentation of SP. EB. Amplitude histogram
distributions of the data before and after SP. The solid lines are single Gaussian fits

to the data showing elementary current sizes of 2.54 pA (CON) and 2.47 (SP). 12.5
