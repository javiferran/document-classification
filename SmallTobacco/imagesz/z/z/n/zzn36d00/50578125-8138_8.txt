Other changes in single channel current parameters would produce
a decrease in mean single channel current integrated over time. Figure 5
shows the different possibilities. The decrease in mean current could be
the product of a decrease in frequency of channel opening, a decrease in
the elementary current of the channel, a decrease in the apparent mean
open time of the channel, or any combination of these factors.

Figure 6A shows raw data sweeps from the control (prior to SP
application) and experimental (after SP) conditions. In this experiment
only the M channel class is present. Following SP application, the
elementary current of the single channels remains unchanged. The
amplitude histograms (figure 6B) indicate mean single channel
amplitudes of 2.54 pA for control vs 2.47 pA after SP. However, the
