can be distinguished from one another by both slope conductance and
mean burst duration. The slope conductances are: S =15-20 pS, M = 30-
35 pS and L =45-50 pS. The burst distribution of each class is fit with
two exponentials with time constants of 1 ms and 8 ms for S, 2 ms and
10 ms for M, and 3 and 12 ms for L. The three amplitude classes also
differ in the frequency with which they occur in cell-attached patches. $
and M are the predominant classes, seen in the majority of patches
(approximately 70%). L is less common (53% of the patches).

Figure 2. Sympathetic neurons from EDJ7 chicks have four classes of ACh-
elicited channels

Left: Nonconsecutive traces of a cell-attached patch recording from an ED 17

neuron showing S, M, L, and the new XL class. ACh concentration = 1 HM. Pipette
potential = 50 mV (membrane potential = -100 mV). Calibration bars = 7.5 pA, 5
msec. Right: Amplitude histogram of the same record illustrating XL as a fourth

peak in the distribution. The superimposed curve shows the sum of four Gaussians

with means of 2.4 pA, 4.1 pA, 5.5 pA and 6.9 pA.
