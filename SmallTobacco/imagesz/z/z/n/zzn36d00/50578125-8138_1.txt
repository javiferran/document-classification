METHODS

Cultured lumbar sympathetic neurons were obtained by dissecting
the lumbar ganglia from embryonic day 9-11 (ED 9-11) and ED16-17
chicks, dissociating the ganglia to individual cells, and plating them under
conditions that suppress proliferation of non-neuronal cells (Role, 1984),
Recordings were obtained from neurons that had been maintained in
vitro for 4 to 14 days, The single channel characteristics of AChR
channels were studied using primarily the cell-attached patch clamp
protocol of Hamill et. al. (1981), although in some experiments the
outside-out patch configuration was also used. For cell-attached patch
experiments, the solution in the patch pipette contained ACh (1 - 15 pM)
dissolved in an extracellular recording solution consisting of (mM): NaCl
(150), KCI @), MgCls (1), CaCly (1) and HEPES (10), pH 7.2. For outside-out
patch recording, the patch pipette was filled with an intracellular
solution consisting of (mM): KCl (150), NaCl (3), MgClo (1), EGTA (1) and
HEPES (10), pH 7.2. Prior to use, the patch pipeties were coated with
either Sylgard or Sigmacote to reduce Pipette capacitance to bath ground,
ACh and SP were applied either singly or in combination by pressure
ejection from a wide bore (~2 Hm) pipette placed within 20 fm of the
patch or cell soma respectively. All experiments were done at 20 - 25Â°C.
Single channel current recordings were filtered (1-4 khz), digitized, and
analyzed cither on-line or off-line using a Digital Equipment Corporation
LSI 11/73 computer with Basic 23 software developed by one of the
authors (S. M. Schuetze).

DEVELOPMENTAL REGULATION OF CHICK AChR SINGLE CHANNEL
CHARACTERISTICS

Neurons in the chick sympathetic ganglionic chain receive
preganglionic cholinergic input from cells located dorsally in the spinal
cord. in vitro innervation of the sympathetic neurons by preganglionic
neurons significantly enhances AChR sensitivity as assayed by
measurement of peak current elicited by applied ACh (Role, 1988). This
