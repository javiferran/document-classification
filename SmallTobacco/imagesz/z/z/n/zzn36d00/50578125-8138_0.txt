INTRODUCTION

To date the best characterized receptor-channel complex is the
muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), Several studies
demonstrate that muscle AChRs are subject to various forms of
regulation. Distinct changes in channel properties, receptor distribution
and subunit composition are observed over the course of development.
Also, acute changes in the degree of receptor phosphorylation induce a
functional change in the rate of receptor desensitization (for a review,
see Schuetze and Role 1987). These extensive studies of muscle AChR
regulation provide an important intellectual framework for studies of
other ligand-gated channels in the central and peripheral nervous
system.

Initial studies of neuronal nicotinic ACh receptors suggest that
there may be structural, pharmacological, and functional differences
between muscle and neuronal nicotinic receptors (this volume). We are
interested in two related problems pertinent to nicotinic AChR function:
(1) how neuronal nicotinic receptors of the chick sympathetic ganglion
neurons are regulated during development and following synapse
formation and (2) how AChR function may be subsequently modulated
by another transmitter present in these ganglia, the peptide substance P
(SP).
