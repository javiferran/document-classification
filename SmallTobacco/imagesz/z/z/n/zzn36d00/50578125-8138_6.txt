isolated from the externally applied SP. Therefore any SP-induced
change in the ACh-gated single channel activity within the patch of
membrane isolated by the pipette would indicate that SP is acting via a
second messenger.

Figure 3. SP modulates AChR channel behavior

(Top; A & B) Schematic diagram illustrating the protocol used to determine
whether SP can modulate ACh-gated single channel current activity within a cell-
attached patch of membrane when applied to the remainder of the cell. The
prediction is that SP would modulate channel behavior in a manner consistent with
an enhancement of the rate of AChR desensitization, decreasing the frequency of
channel openings. (Bottom; A & B) Compressed data sweeps from an experiment
showing single channel activity before (A) and after (B) SP application. [ACh] in
the patch pipette is 12.5 [M

The results from one such experiment are displayed in the records in
Figure 3A & B. Prior to SP application the ACh-activated single channel
currents are somewhat clustered in their openings, presumably due to
ACh-evoked desensitization (3A). After pressure-ejection of SP the
frequency of channel opening decreases (3B). The effects of SP on
opening frequency is seen with both channel types.

In order to describe the SP-induced decrease of ACh single channel
opening we quantitated the effect as the mean current within the patch,
