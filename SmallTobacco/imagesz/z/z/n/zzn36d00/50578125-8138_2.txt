enhancement of AChR sensitivity could be a function of increased
numbers of functional receptors and/or changes in AChR single channel
characteristics.

We used lumbar sympathetic neurons maintained in vitro to study
AChR single channel current characteristics at two time points during
development - from ED 10 chicks (prior to synaptogenesis observed in
vive) and from ED 16-17 chicks (during the first major wave of synapse
formation in vivo).

In neurons isolated on ED 10, just prior to innervation in vivo, we
found that non-desensitizing concentrations of ACh (1-5 |&M) activate
three distinct channel amplitude classes, S, M, and L, in both cell-
attached (Figure 1) and outside-out patches (not shown). These classes

Figure 1. Sympathetic neurons from ED 10 chicks have three classes of ACh-
elicited channels.

Left: Non-consecutive traces of a cell-attached patch recording from an ED 10
neuron illustrating the three amplitude classes, 5, M, and L. ACh concentration = 1
WM. Pipette potential = 50 mV (membrane potential ~ -100 mV). Calibration bars =
7.5 pA, 5 msec. Right: Amplitude histogram of the same record showing that the
three classes give rise to three peaks in the distribution. Superimposed on the

histogram is the sum of three Gaussians with means of 2.2 pA, 3.9 pA, and 5.4 pA.
