The mean current is calculated as an integral of the single channel
current openings as a function of time recorded prior to, during, and
after SP application. This analysis, therefore, is not constrained by the
number of channel types available in a given patch of membrane. The
prediction, based on the observed decrease in frequency shown in Figure
3, is a decrease in the mean current with SP application. A mean current
plot for one experiment is shown in Figure 4. In seven of eight
experiments, ten second applications of SP significantly decreased the
single channel mean current. If the cell-attached patch were held for a
long enough duration, the reduction in mean current recovered to control
levels (data not shown),
