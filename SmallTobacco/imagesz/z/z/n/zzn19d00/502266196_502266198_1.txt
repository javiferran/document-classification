The following compounds have been isolated and identified during the
past two weeks: 3-methyl-4-ethylphenol, 3-methyl-5-ethylphenol, 2-ethyl-
4-methylphenol, 2,4,5-trimethyl phenol, 2-propylphenol, 2-isopropylphenol,
4-methylcatechol, 2-acetylfuran, 1-hydroxy-2-propanone acetate, 2-hydroxy-
3-methy1-2-cyclopenten-l-one, 4-acety1]-2,6,8-trimethylnonane, and 5-indanol.

Also found were seven compounds whose spectral data agreed closely
with corresponding data of known compounds. In several instances, the
corresponding data of known compounds were not available for comparison.
These include: 2,3,4-trimethylphenol, 2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenol, three
methylindanols (one with the methyl group on the 5-numbered ning)» a -

dimethyl or an ethyl indanone (substitution on the benzene ring), and an
indenol. -

III. HOMOGENIZED TOBACCO ~
A blend of 48% '68 flue-cured, 38% burley, 7% aged Turkish tobacco, and

7% flue-cured stems was extracted successively with water and 2-propanol. .

The residue was then autoclaved, and sheets made. The extracts were concentrated

and returned to a portion of the sheets. A duplicate blend was autoclaved in

water, the aqueous extract separated and concentrated, sheets made, and the

aqueous extract returned to a portion of the sheets. Cigarettes were made

from the products for smoke analyses and taste testing.

_._ Analyses are not complete. Preliminary taste testing indicates that

(1) Autoclaving improves green tobacco. (2) The return of the aqueous

extract is beneficial. (3) The 2-propanol extract imparts a "weedy" off-taste,
but enhances mildness.

In a similar experiment, '68 flue-cured tobacco was extracted successively
with water and 2-propanol, then one-half the aqueous extract was concentrated
by freeze-drying. The other half was concentrated on a rotary evaporator.
Sheets were made from the residue and the extracts returned to the sheets.

Test paneling of cigarettes made from the products revealed no significant
difference between the freeze-dried process and the simple flash evaporation.

IV. FLUE-CURED TOBACCO

The tobacco requested has been received, and the untreated tobacco gave
the following sugar data:

Grade/Year Sugar, % a
ugar, «

SY4/65 21.6
SY4/67 20.3
SY4/68 14.3

The SY4/67 is not under study at present. Analyses of the SY4/65 and 68
are in progress.
