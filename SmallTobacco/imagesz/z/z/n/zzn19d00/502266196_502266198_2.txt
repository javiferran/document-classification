VPC profiles have been obtained on the ether extract of the steam
distillate from SY4/65, SY4/68, and SY4/68 plus sugar to 21.6%. The
profiles for SY4/68 and SY4/68 plus sugar were identical; the profiles
for SY4/65 and SY4/68 differed slightly in some minor peaks. To
ascertain whether these differences are due to aging, high and low
sugar samples from the '68 crop have been. ordered.

Cigarettes containing SY4/65, SY4/68, and SY4/68 plus gugar have
been submitted for smoke analysis.
