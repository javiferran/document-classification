I. PUFFED TOBACCO

The study of puffing with volatile liquids, e.g., Freon-11, near
ambient temperature has been continued to-extend the useful range of -
operating conditions. The process had produced a 230% increase in cross-
sectional area of flue-cured stem sections previously. The concentration
of Freon-11 vapor in the atmosphere-used to treat the stem sections has
been estimated to be 5.4 mg./ml. by MS. An attempt to estimate the
quantity of Freon-11 absorbed by the stem sections continues.

The stem section method has been applied to puffing with aqueous C02.
Preliminary data (see table) establish the system as a possible basis for
a puffing process. - .

Ii. CELANESE SMOKING MATERIAL

The Et20-soluble portion of smoke condensate from 64;085 cigarettes
containing Celanese smoking material was chromatographed on silicic acid
to give 8 fractions. Investigation of the first two fractions has been
completed; investigation of the third fraction is near completion, and
the investigation of the fourth fraction is well underway.
