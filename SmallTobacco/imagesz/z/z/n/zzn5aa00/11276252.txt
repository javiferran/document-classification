extremely interssted in a study dealing with the correlation
of bloodflow and perfusion as related to tobacco, ititake.

I have personally been involved in these
type of studies before, I participated with Dr. Walter Redisch
in several tobacco projects at New York University when I was
engaged in post-graduate work in vascular physiology. My
personal interest is in microvascular physiology.

Do you know about any funds available by
groups such as your own for research projects dealing with
the effects of tobacco on the flow and perfusion in the Lower.

along these lines,

Thanking you in advance I remain,

Cordially,
