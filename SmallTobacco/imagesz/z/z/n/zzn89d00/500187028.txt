R.J. REYNOLDS TOBACCO COMPANY

WINSTON- SALE M, NORTH CAROLINA

 

February 25, 1964

Dear Fellow Employee:

Yesterday a special report was given to you concerning the Company’s
activities for 1963. While much of this report carried information from the
annual 1963 shareholders’ report (mailed to all stockholders last Thursday)
space did not permit it to carry all of a statement we made to the many people
who have invested in the Company. We feel that the statement is just as im-

C ‘ portant to you and would like to share it with you now:

“Like all members of the tobacco industry -- which includes

growers, warehousemen, processors, suppliers, manufacturers,
distributors, and retailers -- the Company is confronted with pro-
blems resulting from the report of the Surgeon General’s Commit-
tee on Smoking and Health which was released on January 11, 1964.
It will face these problems realistically in a continuing effort to do
what is best for the users of its products, for its stockholders and
employees, for the communities in which it operates, and for the
industry of which it is apart. It will continue to support an inten-
sified research program designed to find truly scientific answers
to the complex problems of smoking and health --from the growing
and processing of tobacco to the methods of its use. It is confident

that the combined efforts of government and the industry will even-
ally satisfactory from the

tually point the way to a solution, equ
standpoint of public health and the tobacco business. ”

To show that your Company already has shited its words to action, there
are reprinted on the next page two newspapers’ stories announcing recent grants
of funds by the tobacco industry for intensifying and expanding basic research.
Your Company is a substantial contributor to both programs. ,
