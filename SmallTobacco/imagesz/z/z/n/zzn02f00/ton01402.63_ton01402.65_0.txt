Dear Mr. §Strauss::

There are certsin trade policies oi the Japanese government
which discriminate. against. inported cigarettes which ve
believe you should discuss with Japan. . We urge you to

put these policies on your agenda for your forthcoming.
neetings in Tokyo, and if necesgary, carry: the naiter

into the Tokyo round of multinational trade negotiations
in Geneva. uwext year.

¥s are @ major United States nanufactarer of cigarettes:

which we export to nany international markets, including

dapan. We cam seil in Japan enly through the: Japan Tobacco

ang Zalt Public. Corporation ("JTS"), an arm of the Japanege

Ministry of Finance. Our sales of cigarettes would be

many times larger ib. Japan were it not. for policies practiced

by ITS which restrict the marketing of sux cigeretteg and ;
piace our products at 2 disadvantage as compared to Japanese |
domestic cigarettes. It is our understanding that the
policies: appiy te ail imported cigarettes and to that
extent ve speak for other U.S. cigarette exporters asx
well, We shall describe the discriminating policies in
more detail.

iTS applies =. quota to all imported cigarettes which
limits the totsi number of imported cigarettes silowed
