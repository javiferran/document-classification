The role of alpha, antitrypsin deficiency as a risk factor in the
development of chronic airways obstruction.

The investigator's specific aim is to examine the role of alpha
antitrypsin (a, AT) deficiency as a risk factor in the development of

chronic airway obstruction. The hypotheses to be tested are that

a) MZ heterozygote for a,AT deficiency has impaired lung function as
measured by a wide range of tests of lung mechanics and

b) the MZ heterozygote does not belong to the high risk category
for the development of chronic airway obstruction unless there is an

additive factor such as smoking, pollutants etc.

In view of the unusual population available and her expertise, I recommend
continuation at high priority.
