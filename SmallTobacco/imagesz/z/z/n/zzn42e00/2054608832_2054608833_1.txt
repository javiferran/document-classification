In discussions with legal counsel, we have decided to postpone Records
Management Program compliance reviews until audit objectives and procedures
have been established. These procedures are being written and will be
submitted to the PM USA Legal Department and outside counsel for review in
August. Upon their approval, consistency and standardization of program
audits will be assured company wide. You will be notified when these
procedures become effective.

Finally, I would like to thank you and Jane Newchok for your continuing
support of the PM USA Records Management Program. If you have questions or
need more information, please let me know.
