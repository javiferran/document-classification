I. Advertising and Counter Advertising

firobiem: Advertising is thought to promote initiation of
smoking by adolescents, influenca.': societal perception
of smoking and the smoker and influences the editorial
policy of the print media. .

 

Needs: Research and consensus statement on the influences of
advertising on initiation.

Monitoring of advertising themes and target populations
to anticipate future problem areas and develop counter
strategies early. :

Monitor the editorial policy of the major print media
and publicize the influence of advertising revenue
on that polity as it occurs.

Economic pressures.

II. Promoting Local Advocacy |
Problem: - Independent groups develop separate and often competing
responses to local smoking probfems such as school health
education, smoking cessation programs in the community and
health care institutions, workplace smoking policies and
regulation.

Needs: Effective coordination of planning and response to
smoking problems at local level rather than coordinated
decisions imposed from national. It must involve the
decision-making individuals at the local level, that is
volunteers rather than staff. Probably needs a focus
around an individual issue with a process for subsequent
coordination rather than a form (mechanism that looks
for issues). â€˜

Use of computers and other communication mechanisms to
network. : ,

Need for crisis funding set aside.

Need a central focus for sorting and transfer
of information.

III. Health Care Providers

~

i icular
Problem: The Health Care System and physicians in particu
do not treat smoking as a medical problem, are not
trained to deliver cessation advice and have no role
models in research and teaching.
