a. Porapake~Q 1/8 inch 0.D. x 3 meter SS column programmed
from -190°C to 200°C at 10°C/min and with 30 cc/min helium

flow. This column resolved compounds from C, to about C as

7?
well as CO and C05.

b. Carbowax+20M on Chromosorb-G-HMDS 1/8 inch 0.D. x 3
meter SS column programmed at 6°/min from -190° to 225°C and
held at 225°C. Helium flow was 30 cc/min, This column re-
solved compounds containing from 6 to 12 carbon atoms,

ec. OV-17 10% on Chromosorb-G-HMDS 1/8 inch 0.D. x 3 meter
SS column programmed at 30°C/min from -190°C to 300°C and
held at 300°C. Helium flow was 30 cc/min, This column re-
solved compounds containing from 10-36 carbon atoms,

Nearly all the activity was eluted from the OV-17
colum, with the compounds resolved on the other columns
eluting from OV-17 as early peaks. The CO and CO, peaks
from the Porapak column were not detected by FID; the radio-
activity from these compounds was counted over the range of
their retention times.
