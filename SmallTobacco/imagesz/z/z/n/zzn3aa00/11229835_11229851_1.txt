smoke.
Of the various reports concerning the pyrolysis of par-
affins only that of Rayburn, et al (10) studied the paraffins

ra}
in an actual smoking situation. They added 1 o-1abeled paraf-

fins extracted from tobacco grown in Veo, to tobacco, smoked
the cigarettes, and determined the 1G activity in the poly-
cyclic hydrocarbon fraction of the cigarette smoke. They
concluded that the contribution of the paraffin fraction to
the. formation of polycyclic hydrocarbons was unimportant.

The extrapolation of pyrolysis data to cigarette smoke
must always be questioned. Such pyrolyses are usually done
at a constant temperature in the range of the coal tempera-
ture of a burning cigarette, and with substantial residence
times at that temperature. While the conclusions drawn re-
garding the identity of the products may be useful in predict-
ing the possible presence of those compounds in smoke, no
quantitative extrapolation can be made.

Jenkins, et al (11) and Newman, et al (12) have described
methodology to determine the distribution of radioactively la-
beled compounds in the smoke from a single cigarette. These

techniques were chosen to study the fate of a representative

paraffin in the cigarette during smoking. The choice of
