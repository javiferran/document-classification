a

that distillation of the dotriacontane is the major method
of transfer of the activity from the tobacco to the main-
stream smoke.

The agreement between the recovery of mainstream activi-
ty by the two methods of smoking (Table II, mainstream TPM
plus mainstream gas phase, and Table om) indicates that the
two methods are equivalent in smoking conditions and in radio-
activity recovery. The agreement between the gas phase re-
sults and the TPM results is also good (20:1 TPM to gas phése
by total recovery machine, Table II, and 24:1 TPM to gas
phase by total mainstream machine, Table III.)

The boiling point of n-dotriacontane is 310°C at 15 mn.
The stability of the saturated hydrocarbon chain is probably
responsible for the finding that 95%.of the mainstream acti-
vity is unchanged dotriacontane, proving that distillation is
the major transfer process, It might be presumed that the
high boiling point would cause deposition of the compound in
the tobacco as the smoke cooled, thereby causing sharply in-
creased delivery in the last puff and high concentrations of
dotriacontane in the unsmoked portion of tobacco, The lack

of high delivery in the last puff may be explained by the tem-
