INTRODUCTION

The paraffinic hydrocarbons present in tobacco leaf tis-
sue have received considerable attention. Tobacco leaf con-
tains many paraffins, with n-hentriacontane (C34 Hey) as the -
major component (1). The Co72 So9> Cag. Cae, and C4, paraffins
are also present, but in lesser concentrations. The total |
paraffin content is variable among the various types and grades
of tobacco, but is about 0.3% of the dry weight of the tobac-
co. Mold, et al (2) found that over 70% of the paraffin frac-
tion was made up of Cay; C95 and Ca hydrocarbons.

Lam (3) reported in 1955 that the paraffin fraction of
tobacco extract pyrolyzed over pumice at 800Â°C, yielded meas-
urable quantities of polycyclic hydrocarbons. This finding
led to numerous studies by other investigators (4-9) to deter-
mine both the amount of paraffins present and the amount of
polycyclic hydrocarbons which might be generated: from the par-
affin in the burning cigarette. Wynder and Hoffman (8) have
discussed these findings in some detail in their consideration

of the precursors of polyaromatic hydrocarbons in cigarette
