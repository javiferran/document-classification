perature profiles published by Egerton, et al (13). They
reported a temperature gradient that becomes very sharp as
more puffs are taken, sc that the temperature during the 8th
or 9th puff drops from 800° to 50°C in about 10 mm. Since
these cigarettes were smoked to a 20 mm putt, the dotriacon-
tane in the butt did not distill into the smoke. The lack of
build up in the butt can be accounted for only by assuming
that the dotriacontane is entirely in the non-volatile por-
tion of particulate phase smoke, and that filtration by the
tobacco is by diffusion of the volatile portion of the partic-
ulate phase into the leaf rather than by impaction of the non-
volatile particles onto the surface of the leaf.

It is more difficult to explain the transfer of nearly
50% of the activity to the sidestream smoke, but it is prob-
able that as soon as the momentum of the smoke stream due to
the puff is lost, the gas flow within the cigarette rod near
the burning zone reverses and flows toward the burning zone,
carrying with it the distilled dotriacontane from the appro-
priate isotherm. As the dotriacontane passes through the
burning zone, some is combusted, some is pyrolyzed, and some
escapes unchanged. The small amount of activity present in .

the mainstream gas phase may then be due to the sudden rever-
