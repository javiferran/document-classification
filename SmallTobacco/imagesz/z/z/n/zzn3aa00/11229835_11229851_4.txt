Mainstream 146 smoke Analyses

The total mainstream cigarette smoke analyses were con-
‘ducted on @ smoking machine previously described (12). The
effluent from the gas chromatographic column was split 20:1, .
with the smaller fraction going to a FID detector for mass
detection. Mass areas and retention times were printed out
on an Infotronics CRS-100 Digital Integrator. The larger
fraction was passed immediately into a 3/8 0.D. x 18 inch
CuO furnace (750°C) for conversion of each peak to MeO.
Cobalt oxide and magnesium perchlorate were used to remove
sulfur oxides and water, respectively. Propane:helium (1:1)
was used as @ counting gas. The 2 cc flow proportional detec-
tor, the pre-amplifier, and amplifier were from the Labora-
torium Prof. Dr. Berthold. A Hewlett-Packard 5201-L scaler-
timer was used and data were printed on a Hewlett-Packard
digital recorder.

Counting efficiencies were determined using 4G acetone

Ite toluene (New England Nuclear).
