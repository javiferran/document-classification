Aliquots of the hexane extract were counted in a scintilla-
tor solution containing 72g0f naphthalene, 216 ml of ethanol,
360 ml of p-xylene and 360 ml of dioxane. The Hyamine 10-X
aliquots were counted in an Insta-Gel® (Packard) scintillator
cocktail. Counting times were regulated for proper counting
statistics. An internal standard (1'¢_toiuene, New England
Nuclear) was added to each sample and the data were used for
applying the proper quenching corrections.

Results and Discussion

The cigarettes containing 4G_gotriacontane were first
analyzed for the uniformity of the activity along the ciga-
rette rod. These data are shown in Table I and demonstrate
acceptable agreement for our studies. The value obtained by
extracting entire cigarettes is also shown in Table I.

The distribution of activity in the various portions
of smoke from the radioactive cigarettes is presented in
Table II. All cigarettes were smoked to a 20 mm butt. Based
on a beginning length of 67 mm, this would correspond to an
expected butt concentration of 29.9% of the initial activity.
The experimental vaiue of 30% in the butt indicates no filtra-
