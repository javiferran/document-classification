Smoke Distribution Studies

The procedures and smoking machine instrumentation
were described previously and were used to obtain 146 mass
balance and activity distributions in the total cigarette
smoke (11).

â€˜The sidestream and mainstream total particulate matter
(TPM) were collected on separate Cambridge filter pads which
were immediately extracted in 25 ml of hexane. The butt was
also extracted in 25 ml of hexane. The combusted sidestream
and mainstream gas phases were absorbed in Hyamine-10X (Rohm
& Haas) and aliquoted directly for counting.

The amount of 14

C-dotriacontane~-16,17 on the cigarettes
was determined by extracting each of four cigarettes in 25 ml
of hexane and the activity determined by liquid scintillation.
The degree of uniformity of the coating of 146_dotriacontane
along the cigarette axis was determined by sectioning several
cigarettes into four equal portions and conducting wet com-

bustions on each portion for total activity. The 14

C05 from
the wet combustions was counted on a Nuclear-Chicago Dynacon

model R1000 using a 500 cc ionization chamber.
