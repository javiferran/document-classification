Summary

The distribution of 14

C-dotriacontane-16,17 and its com-
bustion and pyrolytic products in cigarette smoke is described,
Twenty-one percent of the activity is found in the mainstream
smoke, 49% is found in the sidestream smoke, and 30% is found
in the putt. Of the mainstream activity, 95% is in unchanged
dotriacontane. The transfer of 1 ho dotriacontane to main-
stream smoke is linear throughout the smoking of the ciga-

rette, as shown by puff-by-puff data. Hypotheses to explain

the results are presented.
