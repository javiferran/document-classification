lack of filtration of the dotriacontane by the butt indicated
a reasonable straight line delivery of dotriacontane as a
function of puff count. This was verified by switching a
fresh TPM pad and holder into the mainstream smoke between
each puff. These data are presented in Figure 1.
The mainstream smoke contributions by the o-aotriacon-
tane, its pyrolysis products, and its combustion products
were investigated by smoking on a tctal mainstream smoking
machine. Table III contains the results of this investiga-
tion. The 0.7% of activity found in the CO ana co, is a meas-
ure of the combustion products found in the mainstream smoke,
and indicates that combustion products cof paraffins contri-
bute little to the mainstream smoke. The 4.2% of activity
found in the Cy -Cig compounds is indicative of pyrolysis.
No single compound in this range contained over 0.5% of the
total mainstream activity. The lack of activity in the range
of C34 to C29 compounds indicateâ€™ that the pyrolytic condi-
tions must be intense and confined, since splitting of groups
from the ends of the straight chain of dotriacontane would .
leave compounds of Cy, - C36 with activity. The 95% of the
