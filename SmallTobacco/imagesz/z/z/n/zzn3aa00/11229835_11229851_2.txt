*¢.dotriacontane-16;17 was made because dotriacontane is

present in tobacco, it is similar in structure and boiling point
to hentriacontane and tritriacontane, and it is commercially
available.
EXPERIMENTAL

Radiochemicals

14 ¢-Dotriacontane-16,17 was purchased from Mallinckrodt

Nuclear. The chemical and radiochemical purities were 98% and
99% respectively, as determined by gas radiochromatography,
and were sufficient for these studies. |

Labeled Cigarette Preparation

Thirty-five grams of cased, blended tobacco were sprayed

146. dotriacontane-16,17 (3.91 mCi/mM) in 25 ml

with 0.4 mCi
of hexane. During the spraying, the tobacco was tumbled.

After thorough mixing, the solvent was removed by evaporation
and the tobacco was humidified at 60% R.H. and 75°F. Cigarettes
were handmade using Excel 67 mm length paper. Cigarettes were
selected for resistance to draw and total weight, and were

equilibrated at 75°F and 60% R.H. for one week prior to their

use.
