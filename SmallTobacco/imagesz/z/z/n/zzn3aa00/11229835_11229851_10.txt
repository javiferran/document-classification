sal of flow as the cigarette is puffed.

The pyrolysis technique has been used for some time to
elucidate structures or to study fragmentation products. [In
the study of smoke chemistry, the latter is of prime impor-
tance, There has been much written on the pyrolysis of tobac-
co constituents, but most of these studies were conducted on
the pure components fractionated over 4 catalytic surface.

The correlation of pyrolysis products formed this way with
those formed during the burning of a cigarette is extremely -
difficult, if not impossible, without knowing the quantita-
tive relationship between the precursor and its products in
the cigarette smoke. The methods employed in this paper

make it possible to determine this quanitative relationship
in the matrix of the burning cigarette, since the incorpora-
tion of a single radioactive compound in the cigarette prior
to smoking will result in radioactive smoke components that
could have originated only from the radioactive precursor.
â€˜The actual amount of chemical mass that is added by the tracer
is small and therefore does not alter tne normal smoke forma-

tion chemistry.
