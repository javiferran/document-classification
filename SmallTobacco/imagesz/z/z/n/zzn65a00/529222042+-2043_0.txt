Joe Wanna called--he said their set ran higher on weight too (I didn't mention our data--
he just volunteered i1). So maybe it was the blend affecting the weights.

Les,

The data for the TSG99 FL1459 and FL1460 cigarettes are in the following attachments,
I will also provide you with a hard copy. Included in these attachments are the LIMS
raw data, a summary, physical & material information, and a limited comparison of
previous TSG data by Lorillard to each test (includes their results on previous TSG Cig).
In cach workbook attached there is an overall data sheet "1999 TSG Burley Cigarette
Data from FL1459 & FL1460" done in the same format as the "1992 TSG Flue-cured
Cigarette DATA". ] included as much information as I had from the previous TSG test.

The attached data does not include the bulk sieve analysis, but docs include the
long strands, middle strands and fines for that data. Cigarette net tobacco weight
has been requested and should be available in the next day or two.

The cigarette pressure drop for FL1459AA (505, BELC-21) and FL1459AB (506,
BELN)

is 389 mm and 403 mm. These pressure drops are 61 mm and 93 mm higher than the
1992 TSG fluc-cured cigarettes and about 100 mm above FL1459AC (507, BEHC-21)
and

FL1459AD (508, BEHN). The 1992 Flue-cured set shows the similar difference between

a
those 4 types, but is only 70 mm above the HC-21 and HN-21. I can sec nothing in the A}
data to determine why these cigarettes have a higher pressure drop. These cigarettes 8
