MEMORANDUM

TO: Mr. E. W. O'Neill
FROM: c. L. Tucker

SUBJECT: Taste Evaluation of Menthol Samples

‘Preliminary taste evaluations have been made on
menthol samples received from UHE Co. and Manheimer.
A copy of the report is attached.

Although neither sample was rated quite equivalent
to the current. production Brazilian in taste charac-
teristics, they are both probably within the range of
acceptability. The UHE Brazilian was preferred over
the Manheimer Penguin Brand. The latter sample was
designated as being Formosan but the ratio of neo-
menthol to neoisomenthol indicates that the menthol
is from plants grown in Brazil.
