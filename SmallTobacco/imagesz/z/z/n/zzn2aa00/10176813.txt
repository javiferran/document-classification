“Endocrine Functions of the Lungs"

This is an imaginative proposal, with some preliminary work already accom
plished to indicate feasibility, for demons trating cellular localization of
“converting enzyme", This enzyme has been shown both to. deactivate bradykinin
and, contrarily, to activate angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Both of these
activities are part of the nor-respiraetory functions of the lung, which in this
instance is shown to be a hormonal control organ capablé of affecting distant,
in fact general, function. Dr. Ryan presents evidence to support her claim
that the deactivation proceeds in the "caveolae" of endothelium of small
pulmonary vessels, and that this is a totally new mechanism of hormonal inacti-
vation; this last can be argued.

The methods to be applied are immunocytochemical localization. For this
purpose special procedures of conjugating microperoxidase with antibody to
converting enzyme will be applied te specially fixed morsellated lung tissue in
vitro.

Critique:

The procedures outlined are eppropriate and represent an interesting
confluence of powerful biochemical and immunological methods. Oblique refer-
ence is made at several points to smoking, and to other work on localization
of nicotine and metabolites to cells, also progressing in this laboratory. It
is quite possible that smoking may affect an enzymic deactivation process in
the lig of certain important hormones. This proposal in away can be considered
as preparatory for such investigations at a basic level. It is, however,
unnecessary for actual practical investigation of converting enzymes in the lung.
