Our marketing strategy during the 2nd Quarter 1997 will continue to be
that of beating, where possible, the leading target branded generics’ net
retail selling price by a minimum of 10¢ on packs and 50¢ on cartons.

The targeted generic brands are:

GPC
Doral
Basic

To support this strategy we will offer consumers the following new values of
Pack Coupons/Stickers and Carton Coupons:

Pack . Carton
25 $2.50
.30 $3.00
35 $3.50

(No Factory Inserts will be available)

The addition of the 30¢ Pack and $3.50 Carton Coupons to the 2nd Quarter
activity enables us to ensure that our marketing strategy will be met
efficiently and economically.
