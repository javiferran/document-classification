ANALYTICAL METHOD

DATE: May 8, 1997 MTH#: AGR-028.2
(Replaces AGP-028.1)

TITLE: Maleic Hydrazide: Determination of Maleic Hydrazide (MH-30) in Tobacco.

SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY
This method is applicable to the Agrochemical Sciences Department or anyone performing the analysis
of maleic hydrazide on tobacco at STRL.

SAFETY AND OPERATING PRECAUTIONS

Personnel must be thoroughly acquainted with the potential hazards of the reagents, products, salvents.
equipment, and procedures used in the facility. The current Material Safety Data Sheets for the
chemicals used in this method should be consulted.

WASTE GENERATION, HANDLING, AND DISPOSAL
Follow all relevant company Standard Operating Procedures, state and local ordinances.

INTERFERENCE

Flasks must be clean, dry and free of zine before analyzing any samples. Any residual zine left in a
flask would react with the MH in the pre-digestion phase, thus giving lower results, Any water left in
the flask would have to be bytled off prior to reaching the proper temperature. Also, tobacco would
have a tendency to cling to the flask if wet, not allowing all of the sample to be pre-digested.
