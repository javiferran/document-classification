ANALYTICAL METHOD

DATE: May 8, 1997 MTH#: AGR-028.2
(Replaces AGP-028.1)

STANDARD CURVE PREPARATION
Pipet ai least 5 individual volumetric aliquots ranging from @ to 10 mL onto separate 1.00 gram
weighings of blank tobacco and carry cach through the method shown below, starting with step # 2.

PROCEDURE

Extraction ( record all steps on the appropriate extraction worksheet -scc attachment # 1 )

Weigh 1.00 grams of sample accurately into a 25 mL beaker.

Weigh 5@ grams of sodium hydroxide into a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask.

Transfer the sample to a clean, dry MH flask.

To the sodium hydroxide in the 250 mL Frlenmeyer, add 40 mL DI water, and swirl gently under

a hood to mix.

Once dissolved, pour the sodium hydroxide into the MET flask with the sample.

Add approximately 1 mL mineral oil into the flask and in the thermometer well.

Place a thermometer into the well and place the flask onto a heated hot plate in the fumehood.

8. Heat the contents of the MH Mask to 160 °C, swirl occasionally.

Note: ‘The pre-digestion period will take approximately 25 minutes to heat to 160 °C. During this time,

steps 9 through 16 can be completed for the next digestion phase.

5, Add 4 mL of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde solution to a 50 m1. graduated plastic collecting tube.

10. Make an ice bath in a 300 mL beaker and place the collecting tube into the ice bath.

14. Place the ice bath and collecting tube on the fab jack under the condenser. (see illustration p. 6)
Make sure the condenser tip is immersed in the p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde.

12. Weigh 0.5 grams ferrous chloride and 5.0 grams of zine.

13. Set nitrogen flow using a flow meter to 57 to 63 mL/min.

14. Fill the syringe in the syringe pump with DI water.

15. Collect the water into the syringe though the tube on the tip of the syringe which is connected to
the glass Y tube on top of the MH rig. Reasscmble the syringe to it’s prior condition.

16. Eliminate air bubbles by turning the syringe pump on manually until water drips out of the Y tube.

17, When the temperature of the sample reaches 160 °C, remove from the hotplate and allow to cool
for 5 minutes. Sample temperature will be about 135 °C.

Note: Sample must be able to procecd to the digestion phase immediately; therefore, it is important that

steps 9 through 16 be completed by this point. Once the ferrous chloride is added, the reaction will start

immediately and the flask will need to be attached to the rig without delay,

18. After the 5 minutes cooling period, wipe the socket clean and dry.

19. Add the ferrous chloride. then zine to the flask.

20. Quickly grease the joints of the flask and condenser, attach the nitrogen adapter on the flask, and
secure with a clamp.

21. Set the flask on the ceramic center wire gauze, which is covering the support ring on the MII rig.

22. Attach the end of the nitrogen adapter to the condenser with another clamp.

. Remove the thermometer from the well of the flask and replace it with the thermocouple,
4. Turn on the temperature controller and light the gas burner.
25, Position the safety shield in front of the rig-
Note: During distillation. a temperature range of 168 °C to 173 °C is maintained by the addition of water

from the syringe pump. The temperature controller and syringe pump perform this difficult task for the
analyst on a very regular and accurate basis. Read the SOP on the operation of the temperature
