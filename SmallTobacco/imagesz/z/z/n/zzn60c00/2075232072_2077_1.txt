PREPARATION OF REAGENT SOLUTIONS

p-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde

Ina 1000 mL vol, flask, add 20 g of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde. Add 1 WN sulfuric acid solution until
the flask is about 3/4 full. Add a stir bar to the flask and place on a heating stir plate, heat on low and
stir until dissolved. It will take about one hour to dissolve the solid. Let solution cool to room
temperature, remove stir bar, and dilute to volume with 1 N sulfuric acid.

IN Sulfuric Acid Solution
Filla 1000 mL flask about 1/3 full of DI water. Carefully add 28 mL concentrated sulfuric acid. Dilute
to velume with DI water, cap the flask, and invert the flask several times to mix thoroughly.

1:7 Acid Bath for Flasks

For safety reasons it is better to prepare the acid in small batches under the hood, then Lransfer to a five
gallon soaking bucket. In a 2000 mL beaker, add 1400 mL DI water, then 200 mL concentrated
hydrochloric acid. Carefully mix then transfer to the soaking bucket. Nine batches need to be made.
The acid bath will last approximately 3 months. Remake the acid solution when it no longer cleans the
flasks efficiently.

1:9 Acid Rinse Solution

‘This solution is made in a $ gallon carboy. Make the solution under the hood. Add 3 gallons of Di
water lo tne carboy (to the 2 gallon mark on the carboy). Carefully and slowly, add 2000 mL
concentrated hydrochloric acid. Dilute to the @ mark on the carboy with DI water. Carefully mix.

0.1 N NaOH
Weigh 4 grams NaOH pellets into a 1000 ml. volumetric flask and dilute to volume with DI water.

Standard Solution ca
Stock jom mHE cd

shes F
Weigh accuratcly approximately of maleic hydrazide neat standard (3,6-Dihydroxypyridazinc,
Aldrich) to the nearest 0.1 mg into a 100 mL volumetric flask, Dilute to volume with 0.) N sodium
hydroxide solution.

Intermediate/Spiking Standard EQ), oS

Quantilatively transfer Simb-of the stock standard solution to a 1000 mL volumetric Mask and dilute
to mark with Q@4-N-NeGH! Eg@uivalent volumetric dilutions muy be used. The concentration of the
standard is approximately 10 mg/mL depending on the purity of the neat standard and the actual amount
weighed. The solutions should be stored in the refrigerator in amber bottles. Assign a standard reference
number to both solutions to reference preparation documentation in the standard notebooks.
