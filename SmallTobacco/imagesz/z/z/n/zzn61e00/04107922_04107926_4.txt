In conclusion, we feel both FCB and DFS's campaigns are viable
and represent the best advertising ever seen for the brand. The
decision to select the "locker room" was a difficult one but re-
warding in that it exhibits a creative approach that we are con-
fident will work for the brand today and over the long haul.
