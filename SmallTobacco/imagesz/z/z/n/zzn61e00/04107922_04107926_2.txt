PRODUCT STATEMENT

The product promise claims, "...taste you can count on" (low tar/
ultra low tar) works very well on two levels. Both taste and the
low tar message are enhanced by the image and headline of the ad.

FCB RESEARCH

Particularly noteworthy was the extensive research FCB conducted
on the current perceptions of Kent and on target consumers atti-
tudes and personal aspirations. Emerging from this was a clear
set of brand positioning and creative objectives. FCB's follow-up
copy research reflected "locker room's" ability to greatly improve

smoker perception of both Kent/Kent LII on critical issues of
taste.

While Relaxing

In addition, target smokers image attitudes about Kent were signi-
ficantly redefined. Many of the serious, traditional Kent descrip-

tives were replaced by the more desirable, in-control, confident and
independent images.

Also important, was that the research reflected no negative reactions
from combining the two brands.

ADVERTISING MIX

"Locker room" as presented, works in spreads, single page units,
R.O.P. and most importantly out-of-home. This is an image campaign
that can compete in outdoor. In addition, FCB also presented
several innovative campaign-tied promotional concepts that can only
serve to insure the forward momentum of the campaign.
