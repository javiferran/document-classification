The Office of Technology Assessment memorandum released
today demonstrates how little is known about the relationship of
personal behavior to disease and then, in turn, disease to costs.

Unfortunately, the staff of the OTA had little time to study
this subject adequately.

If the report is supposed to provide a rationale for
legislation earmarking a portion of the federal cigarette excise
tax for Medicare, in our view it fails.

The report itself is littered with clever escape-hatch terms
such as "estimate", "uncertainty", and "may", words normally used
to hedge against legal action. Worse yet, it is based largely on
fifteen to twenty-year-old figures, not statistics, lifted from
fuzzy "studies" openly sponsored by front rank professional
adversaries of tobacco. Could the desired conclusion have been
determined in advance of the "study"?

Finally, this government bureau takes a position now, only
two weeks before a consumer surtax on some tobacco products will
be ended by law. This is blatant intervention confected and
released by the staff of an agency to support a regressive tax
increase which would cost the poor more than it costs the rich.

Lawmakers and opinion formers should read closely. They will
recognize the specious, admittedly vague nature of this non-study.
It is simply propaganda, a political press release requested by
one member of Congress.

If OTA does this kind of work in the vital defense and
security areas where it advises the Congress, we have a very
serious problem indeed.
