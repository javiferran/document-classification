SUBJECT: FULL PRICE ULTRA LIGHT NON-MENTHOL FILTER FLAVOR
ELIMINATION and PLASTICIZER OPTIMIZATION (Except for NOW
Products)

BACKGROUND: Currently, nine different filter flavors are used in our Premium
Domestic products. Of these, three are used in the full price non-menthol Ultra
Light styles.

Testing to date indicates that there is no significant taste difference in products
containing current levels of filter flavor, no filter flavor or ten times the current
level.

Plasticizer level optimization is a program designed to simplify operations by
reducing the number of plasticizer gears used by Manufacturing and to reduce
cost. There is no adverse effect on finished product.

RECOMMENDATION: Remove filter flavors from all full price non-menthol Ultra
Light styles with the exception of NOW (NOW will be considered under separate

evaluation). With the same filter specification change, optimize the plasticizer tevel -

in the filter.

RISK ASSESSMENT: All of the Ultra Light styles under consideration use the same
blend. Products have been tested by the expert panel and are not significantly
different when containing either E235, E240, E249, or no flavor. Additionally, this
material change provides greater flexibility and reduced waste in Manufacturing.

Plasticizer optimization has no adverse effect on the filter and will allow gearing
consolidation on the filter makers.

COST IMPLICATIONS: For the entire group of products, the cost savings for filter
flavor elimination and plasticizer optimization is $72,000 annualized.
