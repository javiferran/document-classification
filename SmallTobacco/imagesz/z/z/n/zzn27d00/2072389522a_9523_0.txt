RE: MI: Mike Barnes, Tricom Pictures...

Hmmm ... why doesn't he 1) go to a library; 2) call the Tobacco Institute in
Washington for more complete, industry information? I do not see how sending
him PM corporate specific information helps his objective ...

So. I called Barnes and he says he is a researcher for educational half hour
shows; this one is on cigarettes, specifically Philip Morris in this case. Hence, his
questions ...Tricom Picture produces different kinds of shows, e.g Better
Parenting; Travellers Guide; Strategic Business Report .... Largly consumer
driven, half hour educational "stuff", which they then sell to the networks.
