He is working on a proposal for a possible show on PM, and has two basic
questions: 1)What separates PM from other cigarette manufacturers? and 2)
Is PM addressing any issues and trends?

I told him I would refer this to PM USA for action; suggested he call the T.I. and
check out the newspapers for current issues facing the industry. He did not

seem to really know what he is researching ....

Over to you all.
