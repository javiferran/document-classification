RE: New York City Sampling Ordinance and Newport Proposal

 

Newport proposes a distribution of cigarette samples
within New York City at an “attractive price above cost." I have
looked at Local Law 27 of 1990 of the City of New York to
determine the answer to the following question: whether the
general prohibition contained therein against distributing free
samples of tobacco products would extend to distributions at an
"attractive price above cost?"

Local Law 27 of 1990 provides the following:

"Distribution of tobacco products to the general public
at less than basic cost prohibited in public places and
at public events. No person shall distribute a tobacco
product for commercial purposes at less than the basic
cost of such product to members of the general public

in public places or at public events."

Administrative Code of the City of New York § 17-176(b).

There are some exceptions to the prohibition which are
not of immediate concern here and which have been addressed
elsewhere. I will concentrate, therefore, on the cost issue.

The code defines "less than basic cost" as meaning

", . . free of charge, a nominal or discount price, or
any other price less than the distributor’s cost, to
which shall be added the full value of any stamps or
taxes which may be required by law .

Ibid, at §17-176(a) (2).
