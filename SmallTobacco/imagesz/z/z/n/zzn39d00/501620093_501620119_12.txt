Data compiled from 9 separate studies. Standard smoke conditions:

10% smoke, 30"/30" smoke/air cycle. Mean preexposure minute volume
of RGH/ARS hamsters was 68.8 ml (mean body weight 124 g); that of
87.20 hamsters, 51.7 ml (mean body weight 117 g)..

t Number of animals involved in experiment is given in parentheses.
