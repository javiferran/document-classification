Conclusions

Our studies demonstrate the need for dose measurements in
tobacco smoke inhalation studies and the inadequacy of exposure
definition in terms of smoke concentration and exposure time.

They also show that even species such as rats, normally considered
to be very sensitive to smoke toxicity, can be submitted to ex-
tensive smoke exposures provided they are gradually adapted to
tobacco smoke. Exposure protocols are presented which, through
interruption of smoke exposure for 15-120 minutes, allow partial
detoxification of the animals and thus facilitate maximization of
(cumulative) exposure in chronic studies. A number of important
questions remain to be answered, particularly since there is
currently no information available on induction: of disease with

the smoke exposure methodology discussed. It is assumed -- but not
proven -- that an increase in smoke dose to the respiratory tract
results in increased damage to respiratory tract tissues. Also, no
information exists relating to dose-rate effects. Is a relatively
short but massive daily exposure more effective than repeated or
continuous exposures throughout the day in terms of inducing injury,
or is perhaps the opposite the case? These and many other questions
call for continued study in order to improve the currently existing
smoke inhalation bioassays.
