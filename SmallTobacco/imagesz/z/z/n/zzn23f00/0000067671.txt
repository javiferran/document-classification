SUBJECT: FLAVOR INSPECTION PROGRAM -— BRANCH VISIT/144

As previously discussed, I will be visiting the Macon Branch

November 1 through November 3. I would like to observe all operations
concerning the Flavor Inspection Program since extensive changes have
been made at the Branch since my last visit. I also want to discuss
the cross-check program and any problems concerning the inspection of
compounded flavors. I should visit the Flavor Kitchen, the Incoming
Materials Lab, the GC Lab, and the primary area. In addition, I

should talk to as many of the panelists as possible, particularly new
panelists.
