PROGRAM TITLE : Flavor Transfer
PERIOD COVERED: February 3 - 28, 1975
WRITTEN BY : R. M. Ikeda

DATE OF REPORT: March 3, 1975

I. Smoke Flavor Studies?

Six of the important volatile odor constituents of TPM were
measured for the diluted 8 mg and the all-strip non-filtered cigarettes.
These compounds were added to the diluted 8 mg cigarette to raise
their deliveries to the levels of the all-strip non-filtered cigarettes.
Subjective evaluations are being carried out on these fortified 8 mg
cigarettes.

II. Flavor Transfer?

Procedures for the analysis of the hydrocarbons in filler and
smoke have been established for the study of the transfer of these
compounds from filler to smoke. There are losses of the added Ci0-Cis
hydrocarbons in this procedure. Investigations are underway to determine
where these losses are occurring.

III. Hydrocarbon Markers?

Saturated hydrocarbons (Ci5-Ci7) were added to aftercut solution
and sprayed on fillers of various brands of cigarettes. These hydro-
carbons are applied at 20 ppm and can be easily detected and used to
identify various aftercut solutions applied to filler.

Iv. Sugar Replacement*

A study has been started to determine if dextrin can be sub-
stituted for sucrose in the burley spray. Dextrin has been substituted
for sucrose at 25, 50, 75 and 100% levels. Initially all burley
cigarettes will be made and tested subjectively.

V. Alcohol Removal®

Alcohol was removed from the aftercut formulation with no
solubility problem. When alcohol was compensated with water again

there was no solubility problem. Cigarettes were prepared with the W
modified aftercut solutions. The cigarettes were subjectively indis- ©
tinquishable from control cigarettes by members of the Flavor Develop-N
ment Division. nt
