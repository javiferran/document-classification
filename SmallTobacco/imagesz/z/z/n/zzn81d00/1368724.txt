INVESTIGATION OF SMOKE AEROSOL

PART VII

February 1966

A characteristic property of smoke
aerosol droplets is their ability under certain
conditions to separate into two virtually distinct
phases. In most of our work to date we have
devoted our attention to the use of screens and
methods of collection that avoided this separation,
because we were hoping to get information bearing
on the aerosol particles as they actually are in
the free state. Even when we found that passage
through a carbon filter increased the tendency of
the droplets to spread we endeavoured to use screens
which limited this to spreading of the droplet as a
whole and stopped short of phase separation.

We discussed “spreading” in some detail
on pp. 7, 8, and 9. of our report PART V. April 1965,
and we include at Plate I. of that report a
reproduction of a photograph showing what we there
termed “a typical case of advanced spreading". In
this case the spreading was due to the aerosol
having passed through a charcoal filter. We have
now carried out some further experiments which)
while preliminary, suggest how this phenomena might
be further investigated.
