Draft Plans

1.

Determine if aqueous carbon dioxide can be used to prepare a residue from
magnesium hydroxide. Determine if this residue can be used to determine the
extent of loss of the minerals of interest when strong acids are used to dissolve
the magnesium carbonate.

. Determine if concentrated hydrochloric acid can be used in place of concentrated

nitric acid to prepare the residues.

. Establish mildest possible conditions for dissolving the magnesium carbonate with

either concentrated nitric or hydrochloric acid in a platinum crucible.

. Establish a method to quantitative the residue.

. Establish a method for determination of the percent magnesium and calcium in the

residue.

. Using the method developed above analyze a number of the sample types of

interest for magnesium silicates.
