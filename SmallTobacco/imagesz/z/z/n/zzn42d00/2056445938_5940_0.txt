Magnesite Residue Analysis

Starting Material
Rehels Magnesium Hydroxide Powder USP - Lot #1094502

Product

Magnesite produced by reaction of Reheis magnesium hydroxide powder USP (Lot
#1094502) in water with carbon dioxide gas at 180 degree centigrade and 600 psi
for 24 hrs.

Resi nerati
A sample of the material is dissolved in boiling nitric acid and diluted with deionized

waiter to a volume of 25 mL. The residue is precipitated under centrifugation (47,000
G), washed, collected by filtration, dried, and weighed.

Residues
Material Wt Used Wt Residue % Residue
Magnesium Hydroxide 1.6500 gm 0.00095 gm 0.0575
Magnesite Product 1.1000 gm 0.00079 gm 0.072

The residue has been analyzed by microscopy and found to contain smali amounts
of various materials. Specific type and approximate amount of these materials will be
discussed by the microscopy group.
