Magnesia Residue Analysis
mole 7
1. Magnesium Carbonate
2, Magnesium Hydroxide
3. Hydromagnesite
Resi m f Inter
1. Magnesium Silicates

Analytical Issues

1. Develop a method for just dissolving magnesium carbonate which is the most
resistant of the sample types.

2. Determine that the method developed for dissolving the magnesium carbonate
does not dissolve an excessive amount of the components of interest.

3. Develop a method for analysis of the amount of calcium and magnesium present
in the residue which will allow us to approximate the amount of magnesium
silicates.

4, Accurately as possible determine the weight of the residue.
Current Status
1. Boiling concentrated nitric acid, under certain conditions, has been established to

dissolve magnesium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide to leave a reside which
contains the materials of interest.

2. Boiling concentrated nitric acid has been show to etch the materials of interest and
it is unclear as to the extent of loss of these compounds.

3. Electron microscopy of the residue has been established as the best method for
detection of the materials of interest.

4, Aqueous acetic acid (1:1) has been shown to be effective in dissolving the
magnesium hydroxide under mild conditions. The resultant residue contains large
quantities of calcium salts which confound analysis for the minerals of Interest.

5. Residues can be isolated by either centrifugation or filtration onto a Millipore filter,
dried, and weighed.
