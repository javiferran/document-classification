LOUNGES

neth Harris, a consultant who fol-
lows tobacco retailing for Cannon-
dale Associates of Evanston, II.
“Cigarette companies are taking
destiny into their own hands.”

Development of such shops so
far has been glacial because of the
uncertainty swirling around the
proposed tobacco setflement — in
which cigarette-makers would pay
$368.5 billion over 25 years to set-
dle most of the litigation it faces. As
part of the settlement, the compa-
nies would Hmit their advertising
and finance efforts to curtail smok-
ing by teen-agers.

Reynolds" lounges are focused
on marketing Eclipse, the compa-
ny's new cigarette, which boasts
that it has 80 percent less second-
hand smoke and doesn’t produce
ashes. The lounges are called the
RJ. Reynolds Smoking Lounge.

“We're not rushing into any-
thing,” said Nat Walker, a spokes-
man for RJR Nabisco Holdings
Corp., the parent of Reynolds.

“But we're not ruling anything
out,” he said. ‘We're looking at
these for their marketing potential
and to provide a haven for our cus-
tomers.”

Philip Morris Cos. Ine., the coun-
try's No. 1 cigarette-maker, also is
contemplating cigarette stores: the
company has secured the rights to
distribute its own products in all 50
states, making it possible for them
to eventually open their own stores,

The lounge in Alpharetta is a
model of discretion with tinted
black windows and an elegant mar-
ble storefront,

‘There’s plush seating inside, and.
coffee and soft drinks are for sale.
There's also a state-of-the-art venti-
lation system.

“You think you'll come out smell-
ing like a smoke pit, but it's not.
even close,” said Mike Cobb, a
shopper who was smoking a Marl-
bora one Monday afternoon.

The lounge in Alpharetta and one
ina mall in Chattanooga, Tenn., are
popular. Five hundred: to 600
smokers a week visit the North
Pointe Mall location, Reynolds
says. The company said it calcu-
istes that its lounge in Chattanooga
will have 30,000 smokers a year.

Smokers and nonsmokers alike
praise the idea.

Some ire,

“It beats standing in the rain or

huddling around the doors,” said

Terri Russell, who was smoking
Camel cigarettes.

Josh Roquemore, a high-school
student who doesn't smoke, said
that the lounge encourages the
habit, but he is glad that it’s there.

“I don't have to sit and eat in the
food court and feel like P'm eating
in an ashtray,” he said.

~ But where there’s smoke, there’: S

The lounge in Alpharetta has
been greeted with some criticism.
Mike Stephens, an activist In Al-
pharetia, said he will no longer
bring his children to shop at the
mail that sanctions what he calls “a”
cancer lounge.”

‘The lounges are designed to at-
tract all kinds of smokers, a3 op-
posed to cigar bars, which have
proliferated in the past few years
and are clearly targeted for an. ups
cale clientele.

At Shelly's, a cigar bar wo
biocks from the White House, lob-
byists and lawyers smoke thick
Hondurans and stp martinis or mi-
crobrewed beer, stretched out on
plush sofas that look as if they
came straight from a Ralph Lauren,
showroom,

The decor is that of a ritzy hut
ing lodge or an old-fashioned men’s
club; the walis in the long, narrow.
seating area are a combination of
burnished oak and thick, exposed
wooden beams. Tiffany table lamps
throw off a warm, inviting glow.

An entire wall is devoted to per-
sonai humidors, set into the panel-
ing like safe deposit boxes in a
bank vault, Each is marked with a
silver nameplate for custoyii
both real (a host of W
movers and shakers) and gpa x
Gohn F. Kennedy).

By contrast, the smoking loi ome
don’t target any particular demp-
graphic. By appealing to all kinds
of smokers — rich, poor and mid-
dle-income -—— the companies ‘can’
conduct market research and test
new products, Harris sald. 3.

“These lounges want to provide’
havens for all kinds of Srhokers,")
he sald. “They're just this side'‘of &
speak-easy. No one will feel uncom
fortable.”” HS

At the Reynalds launges, patrons =
are allowed to light up cigars and.
pipes, too.

“Tf it's legal you can smoke it,” |
said Vonnie Monds, the manager of
the lounge in Chattanooga. ) |
