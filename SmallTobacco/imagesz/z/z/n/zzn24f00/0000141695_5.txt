ACA agrees that the FTC system of testing and reporting no longer
reflects our best understanding o£ toxicology and smoking
behavior and must be modi fed bo take into account changes in
agriculture, manufacturing and our current understanding of
smoking behavior. Finally, the AHA notes that although the ris«

o£ coronary heart disease increases with the number of cigarettes

smoked per day, the total number of years smoked and the degree
of inhalation, there is no apparent decrease in cardiovascular
disease among low tar cigarette smokers. This may result from
consumers engaging in compensatory smoking of low tar cigarettes,
thereby raising their actual tar intake, from new filters whose
tar reduction capabilities| are easily defeated by consumers’
smoking habits, and from Rimerous additives used in cigarette
manufacturing. The AHA believes that the FTC testing and
reporting procedures have fostered the mistaken belief that low
tar cigarettes are safer than high tar cigarettes, and this in
turn has engendered questionaple advertising claims by low tar
cigarette manufacturers. H&W agrees that the current FTC system
is misleading and should be abolisned or replaced with a banding
system. It argues that evidence suggests tnat low tar cigarettes
deliver very little less tar to smokers than high tar

cigarettes, Therefore, banks of high, medium and low tar

designation would provide more useful information,
