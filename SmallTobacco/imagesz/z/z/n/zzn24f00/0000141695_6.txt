Lorillard, on the other hand, comments that test data on
compensatory smoxing is extremely limited and involves only short
term cigarette product ewitching studies or very limited hole
blocking studies which provide no insight into the behavior of
smokers in the long run. â€˜ghey recommended that the system remain
unchanged. For example, they assert that manipulation of the
testing parameters (puff volume , puff frequency, etc.) would
merely shift the current telative ranking scale and wouid not
provide consumers with any new or different information.

Finally, 27R commented that the three health organizations are
now agreeing with the view RJR espoused in 1967 that the tar and
nicotine content of cigarettes is of no health significance to

i
consumers. It reasons that since there is little difference in
the health consequences of smaking low tar or high tar

cigarettes, tar must be 2a benign constituent.

The three health organizations offer suggestions for

improving the current casting and reporting procedure. The ALA
suggests that research be onducted to determine the actual
intake by consumers of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide and the
relevance of the FTC nunbel's to these results. It and the ACA
suggest that the FTC then hese all cigarettes under conditions
which replicate actual smoking conditions, including misuse of
tow tar products. This tebe would require testing each cigarette
over a cange of test parameters (puff volume, frequency and
duration} and usage patterhs, Bath organizations would have tae

TO report the test cesults for the cange of test procedures and
