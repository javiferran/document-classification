In this connection, the Board approved the plan of your

_ spending a period in Dr. Huebner's laboratory at his convenience

in the early fall.

As you will see from the enclosure, good progress has been
made in arranging for provision of a “reference cigarette" for
experimental use, ‘The enclosed draft was made by Dr. G. W. Stokes,
Director of the Tobacco and Health Research Program at the
University of Kentucky, Lexington, Ky. 40506, whe will handle the
distribution, While this draft may not be in final form, it will
inform you on the status of the plan.

Of course it should be emphasized that the filling of an
application must not be construed to imply a commitment as such
action depends upon a decision which can only be made by the
Scientific Advisory Board.

We are enclosing application forms in case you are ready to
file a proposal for the September meeting.

With kind regards.

Sincerely yours,

Robert C. Hockett, Ph.D.
Associate Scientific Director
