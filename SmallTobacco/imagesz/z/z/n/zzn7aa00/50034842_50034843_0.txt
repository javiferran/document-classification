Dear Doctor Lauchtenberger:

| Your letter of May 11, 1968 was read and discussed at the
May 25th meeting of our Scientific Advisory Board,

It was their consensus that further areas of common scientific
interest between you and the Board may be found when aufficient time
has been given to the analysis of results obtain ed in the past,
improvement of mechanical equipment for exposing animals to smoke
inhalation, digeussion of virus problems, etc. Hence, they did not
feel, ready to encourage you to give notice to present members of your
staff who might be needed for further projects in future.

in order to provide time for you to conclude your present
work, for stock-taking and planning conferences on future programs,
they agreed to continue support to your program at substantially the
current level to a termination date of January 1, 1969. Meanwhile,
the Board indicated a willingness to consider work other than the
present project if you can advise them of a project of interest to both
you and the Board,

If you are ready with any such proposal by August 1, 1968,
it can be considered at the September lth meeting of the Board. The
next meeting thereafter will be on an undetermined date in December
with a deadline on November 1st.

As you know, certain steps are being undertaken in the hope
of perfecting the equipment for chronic exposure of small animals to
whole, fresh, normal cigarette smoke and of developing a better method
for measuring the actual exposure of lung surfaces, especially to
particulate material. While it is hoped that these goals may be
reached quickly, there is an element of uncertainty as to when every-
thing will be considered ready for resuming animal inhalation studies
on a large scale. Meanwhile, however, plans can be laid, feasibility
studies may be practicable and perhaps studies of gas-phase inhalation
or of gas-phase constituents may be possible, and studies of cells

Oe -— in culture-couid be-continued.,- There are also many virus-probiens ——
requiring attention and some of these might be emphasized during the
- interim,
