I. Brothers Filter

a. Mold Modifications
The design of the Brothers Filter has been modified on both the
exterior and interior of the filter.

The exterior of the filter has been modified in order to improve
performance of the filter on the filter making machine and to obtain
a design which would be different from the outside of the Parliament
mouthpiece. The original structure of the serrated Brothers Filter
was such that when cigarettes were made the serrated plug meshed with
the roll drum on the making machine and resulted in creasing of the
tipping. Three approaches have been tried to eliminate this:

(1) The section of the roll drum under the filter
was filled to give a smooth surface. The
creasing effect was eliminated but tipping
was wrinkled in spots.

(2) The number of serrations was reduced from
18 to 10 in order to avoid meshing. This
eliminated creasing and this type filter
will be evaluated more extensively on the
making machine.

(3) The outside structure has been designed
to give a diamond shaped pattern. A sam-
ple of these filters has been shipped and
will be tested this: week.
