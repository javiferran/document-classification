Il. Flue-Cured Grades

Flue-cured qrades which are currently being used in the manufacture
of cigarettes were made into cigarettes to be smoked for comparison of
"straight" and "X" grades. These tests will be numbered HM-150 - HM-156.

D. G-13 DEVELOPMENT

I. G-13 Processed Burley for Marketing Tests

As a result of tests on WINSTON and SALEM cigarettes made in the factory
using G-13 processed tobacco, it was decided on April 18 to reduce the tobacco
processed for WINSTONS to 40% of the burley (8.8% of the total blend) and -
SALEMS to 20% of the burley (6.4% of the total blend). This tobacco has been
prepared and cigarettes are being made this week.

Changes are continuing to be made in the G-13 Processing System in order
to reduce H-20 losses. The usage has been reduced from 0.5 to approximately
0.3 Ibs. H-20 per 1b. tobacco feed.

II. Special G-13 Tests -- G-13 Treatment with Denicotinization

Previous reports have described two modifications of the G-13 Process that
yield products low in nicotine.

In both methods, H-20 extract is drained from the hot tobacco. Extract can
be given an acid wash to remove nicotine, then recycled to subsequent batches
of tobacco. This procedure yields tobacco low in nicotine, type G-13N.

An alternate method consists of recovering solvent from the H-20 extract
by distillation, and discarding the remainder of the extract. This procedure
yields tobacco low in both nicotine and wax, type G-13NW.

This month, each method was applied to "mixed grades" of flue-cured tobacco,
1967 crop. Data on cigarettes made from untreated and treated tobacco are
Tisted below.
