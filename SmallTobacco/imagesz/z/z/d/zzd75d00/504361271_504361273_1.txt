Re-Defined Purpose: 1)

2)

Determine if all available resources have

been utilized in an attempt to specify the
reasons for the decline in the consumer
acceptance scores - prototype versus In-Market.

Develop procedures to help assure consistency
of consumer acceptance ratings from prototype
to In-Market tests. '

Improve the In-Market performance of WINSTON KS
through:

a) Investigation of R&D programs, on-going .
and completed, designed to improve consumer
acceptance and apply these findings to
WINSTON KS.

 b) Identify and prioritize key issues now being

investigated by R&D that could lead to im-
proved performance if implemented on WINSTON
KS (Example: Casing)

c) Identify key issues requiring additional
study before the impact on consumer
acceptance can be determined {Example:
smoke pH).

d) Recommend a priority level on each project
based on the team's conclusion of it's
potential impact on WINSTON KS.

e) Monitor each project to assure implementation
on WINSTON KS as soon as improved consumer
acceptance is proven.

Report to management the progress of all projects
or programs that relate to improvement of
WINSTON KS with recommendations for additional
programs as the need is identified.

Each team member was requested to respond at the next meeting, giving
