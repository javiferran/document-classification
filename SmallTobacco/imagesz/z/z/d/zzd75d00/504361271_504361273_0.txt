Discussion:

e The NFO test results from the prototype tests, FT-3775-C & D, were
presented and compared to the January In-Market and the October Marlboro
results. A significant improvement in perfromance was realized only
among the 18-24 year old male competitive smokers. The team was advised
that Marketing has recommended a change in the primary action standard
from 25-34 males to 18-34 males. Among the 18-34 male competitive
smokers, both prototypes represent parity products. Marketing is recom-
mending introduction of prototype C. % 7+ and attribute ratings are
attached for both franchise and competitive smokers.

 

e Attribute ratings from the last four NFO In-Market tests on WINSTON KS,
going back to the first 1982 Competitive Product Test, were reviewed
and compared to 3518-A and 3518-B. 7+ and attribute data are attached.

FT-3518-A: WINSTON KS "A" cut filler was ordered from Manufacturing.
Cigarettes were made and packed in the R&D Plant .

FT-3518-B: Modified WINSTON KS blend with increased casing level
that scored a 59 on NFO. Product was blended, made,
and packed in the R&D Plant.

One common factor among all the low scoring (49-53) WINSTON products

was shorts , whereas prototype 3518-B was made without shorts. Lynn Dube
is investigating to determine the results of consumer acceptance testing
regarding shorts addition. She will report at the next meeting.
