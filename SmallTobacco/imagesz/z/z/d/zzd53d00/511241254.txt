Dear Dr. Woodman:
Dr. Rodgman has informed me of your suggestion that he-come over
to discuss certain aspects of the G-13 process tn connection with
possible submission to the Hunter Committee.
Of course we are pleased to comply.

' Because of ny responsibility in the G-13 Licensing progran--- —s_.
particularly this situation involving one of the largest cigarette

manufacturers in the world-—-I would like to attend these discussions. =

I realize that the matters to be discussed are highly scientific
and outside my scope. Thus, I hope not to be intruding.

If for any reason unbeknown to me you feel it best that I not
attend, such a suggestion would not offend but would | actually be
apreciated. .

Unless I hear to the contrary, I shall accompany Dr. Rodgman.
And I look forward to the discussion with you and your assocfates.

Sincerely, o . ,
Waywed dncé
Haywo6d C. Smith
