Dear Maurice,

The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), which is an arm of the U.S.
Congress, is preparing a report on the likely economic effects of a federally
mandated ban on smoking in virtually all buildings in the country. The legislation
would affect just about everyplace except one’s home.

The OTA may be asking leaders of the hospitality industry for their input on
this proposal. They would be particularly interested in possible economic impact.
While there may not be any rigorous scientific studies of the economic effect of such
a proposal, I am certain you can understand the potential for great harm to your
members.

It is not out of the question to assume that many smokers would simply not
patronize restaurants and other hospitality venues at all, or at least with substantially
less frequency, if they are not permitted to smoke anywhere in the building. As lam
certain you agree, the marketplace is well situated to accommodate smokers and
nonsmokers without additional mandates from government at any level.

Should you be contacted by someone from OTA about this report they are
preparing, I would be grateful if you would let me know.
