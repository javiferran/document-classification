Dear Dr. McAllister

J am writing this letter to inquire about the possibility of a phase out fund for the CFR
grant 2003 about the purification of the adipogenic factor. I am aware that the renewal of
this application was not funded. However, since the submission of the proposal, we have
made considerable progress towards the complete purification of the hepatocyte-derived
adipogenic factor. If we could obtain a phase out fund of 15,000 dollars, this will allow
me to continue supporting for 6 months the visiting scientist from Japan who has been
carrying out this project. This will give him the opportunity to complete the very
difficult but very important purification of the adipogenic factor for which he has worked
so hard. Unfortunately, the Cell Science Center is going through a financially very
difficult time so that people that would be otherwise supported in the interim by the
institutional fund do not have this opportunity anymore. This will also allow us to obtain
additional data so that we can write application to support the whole project. I am aware
that this is a very exceptional request but because of the long standing interest of the
Council for innovative research, I am hopeful that this request will be favorably
evaluated. I will be very happy to provide you with additional data on the progress of the
purification of the adipogenic factor if you need them.

I would like to thank you for your kind consideration in this matter.

Sincerely yours, ff Gbb3hk A
