INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

To: K Schmidt Date: 21 October, 1999
From: E. de Borst cc: MAS, JAG, AKA, TEB,
GAE.

Subject: PROJECT PALOMINO

Recommendation

Reference is made to the attached subjective evaluation results, which were
very conclusive and in favor of a total elimination of both urea and ammonia
rather than urea only.

For all blends in the EU region we, therefore, recommend to discontinue the
usage of RLB and BL, in favor of the utilisation of RLE and Cast Leaf.

Implementation considerations and strategy

1. Priority will be given to production for Norway. As of the November 99-
production, implement the ML PE blend with CL and RLE for FF, MED and
Lights in MUG/FTR. There is no impact on tobacco weight. For Merit and
Merit Ultra, production at FTR, the project Hill blend standardisation using
CL/RLE is recommended. It should be noted that also production of CH
Domestic and Duty Free are to follow to ensure sufficient volumes to use
full batches of filler. A weight saving is foreseen. Sufficient cast leaf to
support this production will be supplied ex Bremen to FTR.

2. Second priority will be given to production for UK. In view of production
volumes and availability of cast leaf, production can only begin in
