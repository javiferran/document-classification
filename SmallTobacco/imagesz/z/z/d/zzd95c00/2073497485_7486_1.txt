January 2000. First shipment of CL to arrive 3" week December 1999. ML
FF and Medium will use the ML DB blend using CL/RLE. In order to
compensate for tobacco weight increase and higher deliveries production
should use Diet II expansion. Confirmation trials to be done as soon as
possible. MLX to use MLX DB blend with CL/ RLE. Chesterfield production
to be made with ML DB biend as above.

3. Considering the current inventory (9 months) of RLB (and BL) the most
suitable date for overall implementation in the Region is approximately mid
2000. In view of the increased deliveries on the German Marlboro, the
parallel introduction of Diet Il is of key importance.

Diet II is available in Berlin as of July 2000 which coincides with the RLB stock
Duration. Qualification of ML DB blend with Diet II for UK will provide us with
product for ECP testing. Also ML PE and MLX DB blends with CL/RLE should
be consumer tested as soon as possible.

lt should be noted that RLB orders have been cancelled and BL orders were
reduced. On the other hand CL production needs to start and be gradually
increased to meet the significant demand. We are running a simulation to
confirm requirements.

Our colleagues from CEMA have shared all actions and most evaluations and
we will continue coordinating future steps.

We look forward to review these recommendations with all concerned in the
near future.
