SUBJECT: Determination of Organic Aldehyde Delivery for
An Experimental Smokable Article Submitted by
D. R. Smart. (PROJECT B. 491, SA)

Introduction

Samples of a prototype: smokable article (hereinafter called
“experimental. cigarettes") were submitted by D. R. Smart for
determinatiion of aldehyde delivery. Kent III cigarettes with
the tipping perforations taped were analyzed as. a control.

Experimental

Both. experimental and control cigarettes were conditioned in

the smoking laboratory at standard FTC temperature and humidity
conditions. for a minimum of 24 hours. The first 9 puffs of each
cigarette were collected under standard conditions. using a 35. mL
puff volume, 2 seconds in duration, at one minute intervals, then
a clearing; puff was. taken. The whole smoke was trapped in a 125
mL Dreschel bottle comtaining 50 mL of trapping reagent. The
trapping reagent. contained 200 mL of 0.125% dinitrophenyl-
hydrazine. (DNPH) in acetonitrile, 20 mL of 1.N perchloric acid,
diluted to 500 mL with acetonitrile. After smoking, the DNPH-
smoke solution was neutralized with 2 mL of 1 N triethylamine.

The DNPH complexed smoke solutions were analyzed by HPLC-UV
analysis at 360 nm. The Hewlett Packard 1090 M HPLC was equipped
with Novapak. (C18) column 3.9: x 150 mm, with a 5 fim particle
size. The mobile phase was acettonitrile, water, tetrahydrofuran
(60:30:10) with a flow rate off 1 mL/min. An injection volume: of
10 PL was: used. Following each analysis, the column was washed
with. acetonitrile at. 2 mL/min for 30: minutes.

Results

The aldehyde deliveries for the experimental cigarettes verses
the Kent III’ control cigarettes are reported in Table 1. The
aldehyde deliveries were substantially less for the experimental
cigarettes.
