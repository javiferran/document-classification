Honorable George D. Aiken
United States Senate
Washington, D. C.

Dear Senator Aiken:

I hope you had a chance to read this statement which we
published in several newspapers the first of this month.

We mean what we say about our commitment to honest
scientific research to help answer the questions about
tobacco, and would welcome your opinions. I can assure
you that no amount of carelessness about the facts, for
which some of the anti-tobacco forces are responsible,
is going to put us off course in seeking the truth,
which is the only way to resolve the continuing smoking
and health controversy.

We hope that our industry's voluntary discontinuation of
broadcast cigarette advertising, as formalized by the
Congress to be effective January 2, will help to provide
a climate beginning in 1971 for the kind of objective
approach to the tobacco question which the public
deserves.

Kindest regards, I am,

Sincerely,

Horace R. Kornegay
