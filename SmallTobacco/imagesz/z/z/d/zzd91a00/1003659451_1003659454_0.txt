Subject: + Accomplishments, 1981: CIGARETTE SMOKE STUDIES

 

PROJECT #1752 | es

1): Air Quality Study in Smoker and Nonsmoker: Homes
The air quality study comparing: smoker and nonsmoker: NO.
concentrations in their homes. was completed. The study revealed
that smoking contributed a small but definite increase in NO»
levels in. the home. However, this contribution was minor compared
to: other sources generating: NO2,, such as gas stoves, gas ovens,
and! automobiles.

2): Quantitative Analysis of Polyvinyl Acetate om Cigarette Seams

An infrared procedure was. develloped to determine the amount
of polyvinyl acetate adhesive on a single seam of a cigarette.

3) Dynamic Fil'ter Dilution Study
A system consisting of a tunable diode laser spectrometer
(TDL), automatic pressure control unit, smoke collection and
° analysis chamber, and a MINC-23: computer has been assembled and
tested for the dynamic filter dilution study.

The software for the data collection and the control of the
‘sampling system has been completed.

4) Support to Manufacturing

Large number of infrared identifications were made of the
chemical compositions of materials. used and proposed for use in
cigarette manufacturing. Assistance was provided in several
problems: involving cigarette "blocking" and spotting.

5) Generation of Reference Library .
Programs were developed to maintain and! update reference

library of infrared spectra for tobacco components and cigarette

flavors isolated and synthesized by the Organic Synthesis Group.
