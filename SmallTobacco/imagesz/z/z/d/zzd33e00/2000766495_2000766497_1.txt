Cc, Processing

The modified LTF-IIA formulations are much easier to
process into sheet, filler and cigarettes than the basic
formula,

II... HEAT. TREATED SMOKING. MATERIALS .
1. Cigarette candidates with LTF or BL-type smoking
materials with varying amounts of either heat treated cellulose
or heat treated burley stems or with active carbon in the sheet
were made and smoked, The results indicated that the greater
tar reduction _was achieved with the filler that contained the
unwashed thermalyzed burley stems (60% weight loss).
â€œ--- =~ 2, The ash composition of the unwashed,.heat treated
burley stems to 60% weight loss has been determined, and a
similar ash- composition is now being: applied to active carbon:
and to heat treated cellulose to match the tar reductions that
were achieved with the heat treated burley stems. The subjective
smoke characteristics will also be determined at this time. -: -

Ill. PATENTS _.

. ol. oA patent disclosure covering the heat treated |
carbohydrates in reconstituted tobacco has been submitted
(PM Case #662).

2. PM Case #641 covering LIF type materials (foamed/
unfoamed) has been broken down into four (4) possible LTF cases
and one (1) which covers the modification of tobacco via salt
additives, All.five cases have been submitted to our Legal
Department,

7 3. PM Case #689 covering crosslinking, wet tensile
strengthening, etc,, of various fillers (tobacco/nontobaceo) was
submitted to PM's Legal Department.

4, The following items will soon be written up for
patent protection:

a. The use of Chitosan in smoking products.
b. The use off polyacrylic acid for making

reconstituted tobacco and/or tobacco
substitutes,
