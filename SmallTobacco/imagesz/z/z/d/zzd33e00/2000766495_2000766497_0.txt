‘Designed Filler - 1504, Third Quarter, 1975

I. LOW TAR FILLER (LTF)
A. Chemical Evaluation

1. The LTF-ILIDF formulation whose whole smoke conden-
sate compared favorably to that of LIA has been modified further
at the request of the Chemical Research Group (6908). One of
these modifications was that of LIJF which is a similar material
to IIDF but without humectant.

The whole smoke condensate of IIJF was then compared
to that of IIDF; and based on the correlation of Grimmer
fractions II, III and IV with activity, the order of relative
predicted activity is LTF-IIJF > LTF-IIDF. The absolute activity,
however, is predicted to be low for both types since the yield
of fraction II is greater than 90%. in both cases.

2. It was decided to test LTF-IIJF further and the
production of 15,000 pounds of this material is scheduled to
begin at the BL Pilot Plant on September 22.

B. Smoking Evaluations

Ll. A range of low tar fillers (LTF-IIDF, IIEF, IIJF
and IIICF) possessiny similar subjective characteristics, varying
tar deliveries, and significantly lower CO values (7-9 myg/cigt)
were developed and screened.

2. The blend and flavor development studies were
continued with 50 and 75% LTF-1IDF in the blend,

3. The use of a mixture of alkaline earth metal salts
of the low molecular weight organic acids (C,-C,») with LTF-IIDF
formilation produced an acceptable mainstream/sidestream smoke
at tlie 50 and 75% levels.

4. The tole of sheet foaming on tar and CO deliverics
is now being investigated with foamed/unfoamed LYF-I1D and I11B.
