Dear Jim:

I presume each member of the Steering Group received a cover
note, a project goal description and a budget from Jack Kelly,
like the enclosed one which came here and which you showed us
in New York.

Surely we look for more than 600-800 cards from the survey of
California's “industry personnel", which are discussed in item I
entitled "Industry Inventory." I should think the Industry would
be defined broadly enough to garner several hundred thousand names.
Perhaps there needs to be a hard core of 600-800 and, on top of
that, a contact group on which we have names and addresses number-
ing in the hundreds of thousands. But all of this should be in
the statewide tobacco action network.

My best regards.

Cordially,

EP/dilt JOULE
