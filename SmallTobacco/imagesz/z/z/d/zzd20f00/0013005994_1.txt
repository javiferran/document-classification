Dunford -2- . February 9, 1976

A casing/flavoring formula judged to be more compatible with
higher burley levels was used on each of the three cigarettes:
modified "homerun" casing with the old VICEROY/RALEIGH 99
flavor (without lactic).

Each of the three cigarettes was tested against the other two
in unidentified, head-on comparisons among extra-long filter
smokers. The test design follows:

Comparisons Sample
VIC RAL Comp

VIC/RAL 99: Mod. Hmrn/No Lact. 99 99 99*

 

62/38 VS 50/50 100 100 150
62/38 VS 40/60 100 100 150
50/50 vs 40/60 100 100 150

*Evenly divided between Winston 99,
Marlboro 99, Benson & Hedges 100

Thus, 200 VICEROY 99, 200 RALEIGH 99 and 300 Competitive 99
smokers evaluated each cigarette. This test was conducted
in January, 1976.

Casing/Flavoring Test

To determine relative consumer acceptance of the modified
homerun casing/old flavor on VICEROY/RALEIGH 99 to Current
VICEROY/RALEIGH 99, an additional product test was conducted.
This test allows the results of the blend variation test to
be related to the Current product.

An unidentified, head-on comparison was conducted on the fol-
lowing cigarettes in December, 1975.

Current VICEROY/RALEIGH 99 (62/38 ratio, current

casing/flavor — with Lactic)

VERSUS
VICEROY/RALEIGH 99 (62/38 ratio) except with the
modified homerun casing* and old flavor — no Lactic

*XCF-174 for flue-cured, XCF-175 for burley
casing, XCF-176 for burley top dressing
