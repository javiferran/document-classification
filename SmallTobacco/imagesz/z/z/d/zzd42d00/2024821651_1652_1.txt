showed the least. variation. These data will be shared with CTSD, where: they. will serve as.a

MERIT ULTIMA TIPPING: PAPER

Merit Ultima KS and 100 production cigarettes from several different production days
have been tested for filter flare-up and coall dropoff at the: filter junction. No filter flare-ups
have been obtained; but. the coal. dropoff rate at: the: filter junction has been high. Previous
testing has shown that this type. of coal dropoff can be related to: tipping: porosity, a tighter
tipping. paper giving lower coal: dropoffi rates. Retained samples. of tipping paper basesheet
were obtained from Hermetite for. permeability testing. Permeabilities of 0.7-0:9 Coresta units

were.obtained fon samples from six different mill rolls, indicating a tight basesheet. This brand:

is being. monitored weekly for coal dropoff to determine if corrective action is needed.
