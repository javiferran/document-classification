Molecular characteristics of ANF receptors in rat lung
fibroblasts

The molecular characteristics of the ANF binding sites
in rat lung fibroblasts were examined by covalently
cross-linking '*51-ANF to its receptors with DSS. Fig.
2(a) shows that under non-reducing conditions of
SDS/PAGE two sites were specifically labelied. Approx.
70°% of the binding sites had a motecular size of 66 kDa,
while the remaining sites were of 130kDa. In the
presence of #-mercaptoethanol most of the 130 kDa sites
were converted to 66kDa (Fig. 24). However. a
jow-abundance ANF-binding site of 130 kDa was still
visible on the autoradiograms. Under the conditions
used here, 66% of the total ANF receptors are
cross-linked with '*i-ANF (results not shown).

ANF and sodium nitroprusside increase cyclic GMP
accumulation in rat lung fibroblasts

ANF produced a rapid rise in cyclic GMP by 3 min
and a maximai 100-fold increase in cyclic GMP occurred
at 5 min in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine (Fig.
3a). The elevated levels of cyclic GMP were maintained
for at least an additional 10min. A 5-fold increase in
cyclic GMP was detected at an ANF concentration of
nm and a 100-fold increase was observed at 100 nM
(Fig. 35). Sodium nitroprusside produced about a
350-fold increase in cyclic GMP by | min (Fig. 3a) and
the maximal response occurred at 10min. A 2-fold
increase in cyclic GMP accumulation was observed at
10nmM, and I mmM-sodium nitroprusside produced a
500—600-fold increase in cyclic GMP (Fig. 3c). The
addition of sodium nitroprusside and a maximally
effective concentration of ANF io rat lung fibroblasts
resulted in levels of cyclic GMP that were additive (Table
1). This observation suggests that ANF and sodium
nitroprusside were increasing different pools of cyclic
GMP by activating different isoenzyme forms of
guanylate cyclase.

Effect of ANF and sodium nitroprusside on particulate
and soluble guanylate cyclase activity - .

Fig. 4(a) shows that !00nM-ANF increased the
activity of the particulate enzyme by !0-fotd after 1 min.
An increase in particulate guanylate cyclase activity by
ANF was observed over a 15 min time tourse. The
activity of the soluble enzyme was not altered by ANF
(Fig. 45). In contrast, sodium nitroprusside did not alter
the activity of the particulate enzyme (Fig. 4a), but
produced a maximal 17-fold activation of soluble
guanylate cyclase (Fig. 46).

DISCUSSION

ANF acts on a variety of tissues to elicit diverse
physiologicat effects that serve to maintain blood
pressure and intravascular volume. The precise cellular
actions of ANF that mediate these effects are not known.
In this study we demonstrated that rat lung fibroblasts
possess ANF receptors that are coupled to guanylate
cyclase and increased cyclic GMP formation. The lung
fibroblast ANF receptors have a Kp of 0.66 nM.
Surprisingly, rat lung fibroblasts have £30000 sites/cell,
which is comparable with or greater than the number of
ANF receptors reported for vascular {Hirata ef ai.,
1984; Leitman er af, 1985; Schenk ef al., 1985; Leitman
& Murad, 1986), adrenal cortical (D.C. Leitman &
F. Murad, unpublished work) and kidney (Ballermann
et al., 1985) celis. At the present time these are thought
to be the major target tissues for ANF.

Two forms of guanylate cyclase exist in most cells, and
have different physicochemical properties (Murad, 1986),
The membrane-bound form, known as the particulate
enzyme, is composed of one peptide with a molecular size
of 120-130 kDa (Kuno er a/., 1986), while the cytosolic
or soluble form is composed of two subunits with
molecular sizes of 70 and 82 kDa {Kamisaki et a/., 1986).
The reason for the existence of two isoenzymes for
guanylate cyclase is not clear. One potential advantage
of having two isoenzymes is that the activation of each
isoenzyme by various agents may lead to the elevation of
