Confluent cells were incubated for 60min with
2 nM-’25L- ANF in the absence (-) and presence (+) of
unlabelled 1 zm-ANF. Samples were covalently cross-
linked with 0.2mmM-DSS for 30min. One-half of the
sample was electrophoresed under non-reducing condi-
tions (a), while the remaining portion was reduced with
2-mercaptoethanol prior to SDS/PAGE (4).

Table 1. Additive effect of ANF and sodium nitroprusside on
cyclic GMP accumulation in rat tung fibroblast cells

Confluent rat Jung fibroblasts were incubated for 10 min
in the presence of either 10 @M-nitroprusside. 100 am-ANF
‘or the combination of both agents. The intracellular cyclic
GMP levels were measured by radioimmunoassay as
descnibed in the Experimental section. Each value
represents the mean +5.£.M, from triplicate culture dishes
from three different experiments.

mediate different cellular responses.

In the present study. we demonstrated that both ANF
and sodium nitroprusside produce a large increase in
intracellular cyclic GMP in rat lung fibroblasts. However,
the increased cyclic GMP accumulation was clearly
mediated by different isoenzymes of guanylate cyclase,
since ANF activated only the particulate enzyme, while
sodium nitroprusside activated only the soluble enzyme.
When fibroblasts were exposed to ANF and sodium
nitroprusside simultaneously there was an additive
increase in cyclic GMP levels. These results suggest that
ANF increases cyclic GMP formation in intact cells by
activating only the particulate isoenzyme. Our findings
also demonstrate that ANF and sodium nitroprusside

were incubated with either (00 nM-ANF or 1 mM-nitroprusside for various times at 37 °C. Concentration--response curves for
ANF (5) and nitroprusside (c) on cyclic GMP accumulation. Cell cultures were incubated for 10 min at 37°C and the
intracellular cyclic GMP levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Basal cyclic GMP levels were 213, 270 and 370 fmol/10*
