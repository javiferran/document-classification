We used cultured rat lung fibroblasts to evaluate the role of particulate and soluble guanylate cyclase in
the atrial riatriuretic factor (ANF)-induced stimulation of cyclic GMP. ANF receptors were identified by
binding of 1®1-ANF to confluent cells at 37°C. Specific ANF binding was rapid and saturable with
increasing concentrations of ANF. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Ky) was 0.66 + 0.077 nm and the
Bingx. WAS 216+ 33 fmol bound/10° ceils, which corresponds to 130000 + 20000 sites/cell. The molecular
characteristics of ANF binding sites were examined by affinity cross-linking of '?°|-ANF to intact cells with
disuccinimidyl suberate. ANF specifically labeled two sites with molecular sizes of 66 and 130 kDa, which
we have identified in other cultured cells. ANF and sodium nitroprusside produced a time- and concentration-
dependent increase in intracellutar cyclic GMP. An inctease in cyclic GMP by ANF was detected at I mm,
and at 100 nm an approx. 100-fold increase in cyclic GMP was observed. Nitroprusside stimulated cyclic
GMP at 10 om and at 1 mm a 500-600-fold increase in cyclic GMP occurred. The simultaneous addition
of 100 nM-ANF and 10 gm-nitroprusside to cells resulted in cyclic GMP levels that were additive. ANF
increased the activity of particulate guanylate cyclase by about 10-fold, but had no effect on soluble
guanylate cyclase. In contrast, nitroprusside did not alter the activity of particulate guanylate cyclase, but
increased the activity of soluble guanylate cyclase by 17-fold. These results demonstrate that rat lung
fibroblasts contain ANF receptors and suggest that the ANF-induced stimulation of cyclic GMP is

 

mediated entirely by particulate guanylate cyclase.

 

INTRODUCTION

Extracts and purified peptides derived from mamma-
lian atrial tissue produce natriuresis and diuresis i vito
(Cantin & Genest, 1985; Laragh, 1985; Balermann &
Brenner, 1985; Needleman & Greenwald, 1986). Because
of their renal effects these peptides have been called atrial
natriuretic factors (ANF). However, recently it has
become clear that ANF also acts on tissues other than the
kidney to regulate blood pressure and intravascular
volume. ANF has been shown to produce vascular
smooth muscle relaxation (Winquist er ai., 1984),
decrease cardiac output (Volpe er a/., 1986) and inhibit
aldosterone (De Lean ez al., 1984), renin (Burnett er ai.,
1984: Kurtz et al,, 1986) and vasopressin (Samson, 1985)
secretion. In addition, ANF has been shown to inhibit
water and saline, intake after central administration of
ANF (Antunes- Rodrigues et a/., 1985, 1986), The relative
contribution of each of these effects of ANF to the
overall role of ANF in blood pressure and volume
homoeostasis ts unclear.

Specific receptors for ANF have been identified in
membranes from aorta (Napier e? ail., 1984), adrenal
cortex (De Lean et al., 1984) and brain (Quition ef ai..
1986) and in cultured smooth muscle (Hirata e7 a/., 1984:
Leitman et ai., 1985: Schenk ef af, 1985), endothelial
(Schenk ef a/., 1985, Leitman & Murad, 1986) and

 

kidney (Ballermann er ai., 1985) cells. Binding of ANF
to its receptors is associated with increased activity of
particulate guanylate cyclase (Winquist ef a/., 1984;
Waldman er ai., 1984, 1985; Tremblay et a/., 1985).
elevated cyclic GMP (Winquist er a/., 1984; for review
see Leitman & Murad. 1987) and in some tissues an
inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity (Anand-Sriva-
stava et al., 1984). Our laboratory has been using ANF
as a pharmacological probe to clucidate the mechanism
whereby hormones and other agents activate guanylate
cyclase and increase intracellular cyclic GMP. Waldman
and coworkers previously showed that ANF activated
the particulate form of guanylate cyclase, but not the
soluble form in a number of rat tissues (Winguist er ai.,
1984; Waldman e7 ai., 1984, 1985). However, because it
has not been possible to activate the soluble enzyme by
hormones or neurotransmitters in cell-free systems, ANF
may also elevate cyclic GMP in intact cells by activating
the soluble enzyme. To explore further the role of
particulate and soluble guanylate cyclase in the ANF-
induced stimulation of cyclic GMP, we have compared
the effects of ANF and sodium nitroprusside on cyclic
GMP accumulation and guanylate cyclase activity in
cultured rat lung fibroblasts. In this study, we have
identified ANF receptors in cultured rat iung fibroblasts.
Furthermore, our results suggest that the increase in
cyclic GMP by ANF is mediated entirely by particulate
