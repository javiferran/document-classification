guanylate cyclase, whereas sodium nitroprusside in-
creases cyclic GMP by activating only the soluble form
of guanylate cyclase.

EXPERIMENTAL

Materials

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM),
Ham's F-12 medium, Hanks” balanced salt solution
(HBSS), penicillin/streptomycin and glutamine were
purchased from Grand Island Biological Co. lodo-gen
and DSS were obtained from Pierce. Rat ANF-(101-126)
was from Peninsuta Laboratories, Inc. Fetal calf serum
was from Sterile “ystems Inc. Rat lung fibroblasts
(A.T.C.C. CCL-192) were obtained from the American
Type Cell Culture. Sep-Pak C,, cartridges wete from
Millipore. All other reagents were obtained as previously
described (Leitman er a/., 1985: Leitman & Murad,
1986).

Cell culture

Rat lung fibroblasts were maintained and subcultured
in Ham’s F-12 medium containing 10%, fetal calf serum,
50 units of penicillin and 50 yg of streptomycin/m). and
584 yg of glutamine/ml. The cells were grown with 5°,
CO, in a humidified incubator maintained at 37°C.

123]-ANF binding assay

ANF was iodinated by adding 0.2 nmol of ANF to
two microfuge tubes coated with lodo-gen (Salacinski
et al., 1981). Then 1 mCi of Na'**] was added to each
tube and the samples were incubated for 15 min at room
temperature. Samples from both tubes were pooled and
added to a Sep-Pak C,, cartridge to remove unbound
radioactive iodide. The specific radioactivity, which
ranged from 800 to 1300 Ci/mmol, was determined by
self-displacement of unlabelled ANF in a binding assay
using rat lung membranes.

Lung fibroblasts were grown to confluence in.24-well
plates. The cells were washed 2 times with I ml of
serum-free DMEM containing !0 mm-Hepes, pH 7.3.
The cells were incubated for 20 min at 37°C with
various concentrations of ?*5]-ANF. The cells were then
rapidly washed four times with tml of ice-cold HBSS
containing 2? mg of bovine serum albumin/ml. The cells
were solubilized with | ml of | M-NaOH and the amount
of radioactivity was determined. Nonspecific binding was
determined by the addition of | #mM-ANF to parallel

shes.

Cyclic GMP determination

Confluent fibroblasts in 35mm culture dishes were
washed twice with 2 ml of DMEM and then preincubated
for lOmin at 37°C in 990 421 of DMEM containing
10 mm-Hepes and 0.5 mv-isobutylmethylxanthine. ANF
or sodium nitroprusside (10 zl) was added to the cells for
various times. The medium was aspirated and then 750 jl
of ice-cold 6°4 (w/v) trichloroacetic acid was added to
the cells. The intracellular levels of cyclic GMP were
measured by radioimmunoassay as previously descnbed
(Leitman et ai., 1985; Leitman & Murad. 1986).

Guanylate cyclase assay

Confluent rat lung fibroblasts were washed and
scraped off 150 mm culture dishes into ice-cold 50 mu-

Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 159 mM-NaC}l. The cells
were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min. The cell pellet was
resuspended in O.5mi of 30 mm-Tris/HCl, pH 7.6,
containing 1] mm-EDTA, 0.5 mm-phenyimethanesulphe-
oy! fluoride and 0.01% bacitracin (buffer A) and then
homogenized with a Polytron. The homogenate was
centrifuged at 100000 g for | h at 4°C. The supernatant
fraction was removed and assayed for soluble guanylate
evclase activity. In order to remove soluble guanylate
cyclase from the particulate fraction the pellet was
resuspended and homogenized twice in | ml of buffer A
containing 100 mm-KCl and centrifuged at 100000 g for
lh. Finally, the pellet was homogenized in buffer A and
centrifuged at 100000 g for Ih at 4 °C. The pellet was
resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm-Trnis/HCl, pH 7.6. and
assayed for particulate guanylate cyclase activity.

A 10x aliquot of either the particulate or soluble
fraction was added to 100,y) of reaction mixture
containing (finalconcentration) 50 mm-Tris/ HCI, pH 7.6,
4mm-MgCl,, 1 mM-GTP, 1 mM-isobutyimethylxanthine,
0.01%, bacitracin and a GYP-regenerating system
comprising 15 mM-phosphocreatine and 20 yg of creatine
kinase. After incubation for various times at 37 °C the
reaction was terminated by the addition of 900 ,l of
50 mm-sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and the samples were
boiled for 3min. The samples were acetylated and
amount of cyclic GMP formed was measuced by
radioimmunoassay.

Affinity cross-linking

Confluent rat lung fibroblasts in 35 mm dishes were
washed three times with 2m! of HBSS containing
10 mm-Hepes, pH 7.3. The cells were incubated in 1 ml
of HBSS containing 2nMm-'*5}-ANF for 1h at room
temperature. Then 1 miof HBSS containing 0.4 mm-DSS
(in dimethy! sulphoxide) was then added to the cells.
After a 30 min incubation, the medium was aspirated,
cells were washed with 2m! of HBSS, 400 zl of SDS
sample buffer [62.5 mm-Tris/HCl. pH 68, 10% (v/v)
glycerol and 2.3°% (w/v) SDS) was added to the cells and
the plates were placed in boiling water for Jmin, The
samples were divided into two portions and 2-
mercaptoethanol (5%, v/v) was added to one portian.
The samples were boiled and then subjected to
SDS/PAGE on a 7.5%; separating gel (Laemmli, 1970).
After electrophoresis, the gels were dried, stained for
protein and then exposed to Dupont Cronex X-ray film
at ~ 70°C.

RESULTS

ANF binding characteristics to rat lung fibrobfasts

Fig. I(a) shows the time course of '*5|-ANF binding to
tat lung fibroblast cells at 37 °C. Binding of ANF was
rapid and the maximal binding was reached at 20-30 min.
Thereafter, the binding remained relatively constant until
40 min and then it began to decline. After 60 min the
specific binding was approx. one-half of the binding that
occurred at 30 min, suggesting that the fibroblasts were
rapidly degrading ANF. The saturation curve shows that
specific binding of ANF was saturable with increasing
concentrations of ANF (Fig. 16). A Scatchard plot of the
binding data was linear, suggesting that rat Jung
fibroblasts contain a single class of ANF receptors (Fig.
le). The equilibrium dissociation constant from four
experiments was 0.66+0.077 nm and the 8, was
