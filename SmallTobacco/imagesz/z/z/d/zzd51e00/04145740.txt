RE: Consumer Consumption and Switching Rates

 

AVERAGE DAILY CONSUMPTION RATE

For 1982, smokers of the major Lorillard brands (Newport, Newport 2
Lights, Kent, Golden Lights, Kent III, and True) smoke an average sg
of 34.1 cigarettes per day. This figure takes reported consumption <4
rates and actual sales volume into account. aa

ONE-YEAR SWITCHING RATES

The proportion of those switching out of each brand "family" during
1982 is as follows (excludes switching to line extensions of same
brand):

Newport .
Newport Lights
Kent
Golden Lights 1
Kent III
True 1

FODHWA

The switching rate out of Kent III ¥as extremely high during 1981
(14.4%) because of large losses to Barclay, which was introduced
early that year.

If you have any questions, please call.
