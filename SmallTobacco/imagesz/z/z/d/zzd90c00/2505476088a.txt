Subject: Milestone Status Report 1/1 - 3/1

Dear all:
As promised, attached please find the milestone status report for the period 1/1/01 - 3/1/01. The attachment details
those project milestones due to be completed by March ist.

As with last year, we will continue to use reporting by exception. If the milestones were met, there is no need to
respond. If, however, you have a missed or delayed milestone, | need from you by noen on :

* anew target date for the missed milestone, and
Â¢ abrief but specific explanation of why the milestone was not met.

lt a delay is related to a resource issue (internal or external) please be sure to indicate this in your feedback. Those

milestones in the attachment for which [do not receive any indication of a delay will be marked "complete" in the
database after 3/14.

Keep in mind that if a delayed milestone is causing other target dates in your project to slip, you need to provide me
with updated dates for those milestones as well. You can include that in your feedback to this report or send me that
information separately (email or updated project sheet; either is fine).

Let me know if questions.

Thanks,
Valerie

Frau Viol: Could you please circulate this to the INBIFO project leaders as appropriate. Thanks.
