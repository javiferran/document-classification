The notice received at R&D, on the final page, item #2,
states:

" through 1(f) inclusive, including but limited to any
and all scripts."

We have distributed it, but should it read instead:

" through 1(Â£) inclusive, including but NOT limited to
any and all scripts."

2? Just checking because it's strange wording.

Thanks. -Marian.
