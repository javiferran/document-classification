SUBJECT: ‘KOOL Media Review |

Frank, a5 per the at:ached, Roger Kirk also ssked me what the input was of
Bates in respect ta media strategy anc selection, My answer was about as
crisp and clear as Al's, . . I said I simply didn't know. Aside from the obvious
problem you have concerning your Managemert's knowledge of what'e going on,
Ido think i: would be helpful tobrief Al and I on what has beer going on in this
area,
It is certainly not the Brand Group's fault that neither Al nor I could answer |

+ Roger's question: however, now is the time to educate Al and J!

 
    
   
 
 

<" Let's target your Brand Group response to this question for review by me and
Al during the week o! July 10.
