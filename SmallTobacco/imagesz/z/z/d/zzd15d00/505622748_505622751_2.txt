o Machine Vision Tipping Glue Inspection System

A representative from E-O Enterprises was on site Fri-
day, April 18, for consultation in the design of a
miniature single- line light source for use with the vi-
sion based glue detection system under development in
the Automation Technology section of PT&D. An earlier
test in the R&D pilot plant revealed the need for such a
special light source to properly illuminate the
deposited glue pattern on-line for viewing by the light
sensing apparatus. E-O will supply the source in May
and will submit a proposal for the total glue detection
system.
