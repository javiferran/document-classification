1 SUMMARY (a)

1.1 Method

The acute toxicity of MAINSTREAM and SIDESTREAM CONDENSATE col-

lected with an impaction trap (MWSC-I and SWSC-I) of the STANDARD

REFERENCE CIGARETTE 2R1 was determined after a single dermal

application on female MF mice. Signs of intoxication, the dose-
py response relationship and especially the dose-mortality as well as
the dose-mortality-time relationship, “ S LD50 and 50-percent
mortality time were determined.

Nicotine, water and the pH of the condensate were determined. The

soe

dried condensates were suspended in acetone and the water concen-
tration adjusted to 25 grams/liter. After adjustment of the water

concentration the condensates were stored protected from light at
minus 75 degrees centigrade until 1 day before application and
thereafter at plus 4 degrees centigrade.

110 female outbred mice, strain CD1, were allocated randomly to 2
equally treated control (10 mice/group), 9 MWSC-I- and 9 SWSC~I-
( 4+ treated groups (5 mice/group). At the age of approx. 50 days, the
mice received a single application onto the sheared dorsal skin
