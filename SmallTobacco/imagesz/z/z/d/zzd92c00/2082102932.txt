Subject: RE: Draft Response to WEAB-TV

Here are my comments in advance. I think the tone might be too abrubt, and Bibbens reacts poorly to
tones he dislikes. It just might add to the headache. Should we also note that we never discussed
rates? I think you address this, in general, but should we be specific?
