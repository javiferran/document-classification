SUBJECT: Disclosure
Aluminum Metal Substrate

MEMO:

It was found that conventional substrate materials have a small pore
size on the order of a few hundred angstroms. These substrates; alumina,
bauxite, carbon, etc.; allow the aerosol generating and flavor materials to
be released slowly. This is evidenced by the fact of discovery of black
(carbonized centers) in alumina pellets which have been subjected to
smoking conditions and by Ames test activity with these substrates when
subjected to high temperature conductive heat. These conditions allow
for formation of decomposition products and increased generation of carbon
monoxide. In order to provide a larger pore size, substrate materials were
formed from aluminum metal mesh and sheet. Larger substrate pore sizes
should result in decreased carbon monoxide and decomposition products.

Example 1 - Aluminum wire 200 x 200 mesh, containing .0021" diameter
wire was rolled into a spiral. The beginning size was 5/8" wide x 60 mm
long.

Two of these substrate rods were made and dipped into liquid glycerine at

a temperature near the boiling point. One of the rods weighed .1003 g
before dipping and .1820 g after dipping. Thus, .0817 g of glycerine was
deposited on the aluminum spiral rod. The other spiral rod weighed .1251

g before dipping and .2542 g after, thus, .1291 g of glycerine was deposited

on the rod. \ Ake gf /h
