The device's tubes were filled with a mixture of .Y-040 glass beads and
impregnated aluminum pellets. Smoke tests were made at one puff per minute
of 35-cc volume.

Example 4° - Aluminum pellets were made by folding a .00025" thick
x 4" wide piece of aluminum foil until it was abut 1/8" wide. The foil
was then pulled through a series of orifices of decreasing diameter until
the foil was round and had a 0.D. of about .060". These rods were then chopped
and sieved. The -10 + 14 mesh particles were retained.

Example 5 - A series of devices were made up from the substrate
pellets as described in Example 4 and the device design of Example 3.

Smoke tests were done on these four sets of devices - five devices were
smoked per pad at a 35-cc puff volume, one puff/minute.
