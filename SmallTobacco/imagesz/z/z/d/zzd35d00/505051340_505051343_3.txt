Example 6 - A spray-dried water extract of CAG blend tobacco was

obtained. It contained 19.51% sugar. It was theorized that sugar may be
an undesirable component in the flavor and nicotine delivery system of
these devices, since sugar is not volatile and will be decomposed by the
temperatures reached by conductive heat transfer from burning carbon.
Don Roberts was asked to alcohol extract the spray-dried water extract of
CAG tobacco blend; he did so and supplied us with the alcohol extract. A
set of devices were made up with the substrate material of Example 4 and
device design of Example 3.

Sample 363647-E - 200 mg of substrate pellets/device, containing
18% glycerine, 5% alcohol extract of spray-dried
water extract of CAG tobacco blend, 77% aluminum
substrate pellets

Smoke tests were done on this set of devices. Five devices were smoked per
pad at a 35-cc puff volume, one puff/minute.

Sample 363647-E:
