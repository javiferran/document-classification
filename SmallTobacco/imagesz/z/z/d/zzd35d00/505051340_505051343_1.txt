An appearance of liquid glycerine was not evident on the outside
surfaces of the rods. When one end of the rod was heated with a propane
flame, aerosol was produced and was progressively moving down the rod as
heat was transferred along the length.

Two devices were made as follows. The alumina substrate was replaced
with the above described glycerine-impregnated rod.

The devices were smoked one puff per minute at a 35-cc volume.

The devices were removed from the smoking machine before all of the
carbon had burned, due to the fact that visible aerosol was not produced
after the fifth puff.

It was theorized that the glycerine boiled off by the fifth puff
because a continuous conductive pathway was provided by the aluminum rod
form of the wire mesh. The conductivity efficiency could be lowered by
chopping the rod into small segments and using the small segments for the
substrate.

Example 2 - Aluminum foil .00025" thick was shredded at 32 cuts/inch.
The shreds were then twisted into strands about .075" diameter. These
strands were dipped into hot glycerine (near the boiling point). Two
sections of the twisted strands, each 60 mm long, were weighed.

Example 3 - Aluminum pellets were made up from .00025" thick foil

by wrapping the foil into a cylinder. Sections about 1/16" long were then
cut. The aluminum pellets were impregnated with 25% (by wt.) glycerine.
