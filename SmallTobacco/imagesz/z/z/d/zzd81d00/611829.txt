MEMORANDUM
TO: ART EDELSTEIN SUBJECT: Chicago Scrapebook
FROM: Tom Neville DATE: June 15, 1979

Superb! Fantastic! Great! Right on! The Best! Perfect! Tremendous!

Need I say more? Of course, the PKG prepared scrapbook was well
done and more importantly, it served the purpose for which it was meant. 3
Say thanks to those who obviously carried out a "labor of love." - .
