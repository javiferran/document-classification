COMMENTS :

In earlier tests (POLs 0234 and 0237) it was found that cigarettes without
casing or aftercut performed better than those with casing and aftercut. POL
0239 was made with a 25% reduction in casing and no aftercut. This model
also performed worse than the model without casing or aftercut.

Note: Only twenty smoker groups were used in the calculation of these
results. WUL smokers were not included in POL 0234.

The attached liking and regression maps indicate that liking ratings were
highest (tended to be higher than expected) for the ultra-low smokers.
