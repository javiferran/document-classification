Dear Dr, Eisenberg:

Enclosed you will find a copy of a preliminary a

proposal which my colleagues and I would like to

for Tobacco Research. This proposal is entitled

I am the Principal Investigator for this project and my colleague Dr. Max E. Gottesman will
serve as Co-Investigator.

We estimate that this work will require three years to complete and consequently the duration
of the grant will be for this period. Direct costs for the first year of this study will be
approximately $70,000 and will consist of only salary, supplies and animal boarding costs.
| Along with a three page narrative summary of the proposed research, you will find copies of
' Dr. Gottesmanâ€™s and my NIH Biographical Sketches and one copy each of two manuscripts
which are related to the proposed project.

| Tf any questions regarding this application arise, I can be contacted by telephone at (212) 305-
| 5429 or by FAX at (212) 305-5384.

I wish to thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
r
