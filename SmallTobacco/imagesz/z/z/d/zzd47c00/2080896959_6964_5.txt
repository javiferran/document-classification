Revenue and gratis product should be prebooked when possible. Any gratis quantity that is less than
one carton should be paid using van stock. This will limit the number of checks for less than $20 that
need to be mailed to retailers. Accounts that receive more than one carton of gratis should be paid
using SFA/FSI.

VAN STOCK SELL-IN

When an account has not received their prebooked product, you may sell cartons from your van to gain
distribution. In this case, you should use the same rules described above to determine whether to invoice
the gratis or pay it out of van stock.

If you have any questions, please contact your immediate supervisor.
