— In examining the second-hand smoke issue, CRS noted that, “Most
organisms have the capacity to cleanse themselves of some level of
contaminants. It is for this reasons that public policy usually does not
insist that every unit of air or water pollution be removed from the
environment; the damage of low levels of pollutants is sufficiently small
(through the self-cleansing process) that removal is not cost effective."

— In discussing claims that passive smoking has a significant cost to society,
CRS counters that "Fist, as stated above, the epidemiological evidence for
passive-smoking-related disease is weak." And CRS later notes:
"Individuals undertake many activities that others find distasteful, and
many, perhaps most, of them are not subject to government control."
