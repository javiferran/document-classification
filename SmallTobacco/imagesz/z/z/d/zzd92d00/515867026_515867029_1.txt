— The CRS report also found that the average smoker is aware of, or over-.
estimates, the health risks of smoking.

2. The Cigarette Tax Is a Poor Source Of Reve enue For Health Care --

CRS said the tax would bring in less and less money as fewer people smoke
and it would “finance a continually smaller share of health-care costs."

— The report characterized the proposal, saying "An increased Cigarette tax
as a method of financing health-care reform appears questionable on
efficiency, budgetary and equity grounds."

~~ The report said that while a cigarette tax would raise considerable
revenue, it would finance a continually smaller share of health care costs.

— The CRS study found that because of dropping consumption, tobacco tax
revenues -- estimated at about $11 billion in the first year of the increase -
~ would fall by about 10 percent over the next 15 years and eventually
drop by one-third.

— According to CRS, the states levy an average of 26 cents per pack in state
excise tax. “The 75 cent proposed federal tax will reduce consumption of
cigarettes. As a result, states will lose 26 cents on every pack of reduced
cigarette consumption...The state revenue loss grows from $1 billion to
about $3.6 billion over (the 69-year-chart presented)."

— "Pleasure driving, many recreational activities, some dietary practices,
and some occupations, to name just a few activities, involve the same
actuarially-validate risks...Taxing such activities involves value judgments
that are beyond the scope of economic analysis," CRS said.

the problem" (of youth smoking).
