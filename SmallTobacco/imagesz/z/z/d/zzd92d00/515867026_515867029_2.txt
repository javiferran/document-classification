— CRS also said: * or those smokers who make poor decisions because of
inadequate information, such as the young, increased education and
regulation might be more effective market Corrections and have fewer
undesirable economic effects than a tax,"

4. The Evi nce on Environmen 1T moke I; ~- According to
CRS, "The epidemiological evidence on the health effects of Passive smoking

is far less certain than evidence on the effect of active Smoking." Even if the
uncertainties of Overestimating and underestimating the so-called costs of

Passive smoking were weighed, CRS puts the costs from Passive smoking "as
low as zero to four cents per pack,"

— But if the &0vernment tries to Impose a higher cigarette tax based on the
cost of passive Smoking, “evidence Suggests the majority of smokers will
not be deterred by the tax." As a results, CRS Says, "The majority of
Spouses and children of these undeterred smokers will not benefit from
reduction of Passive-smoking effects, but will be Penalized because the tax
will reduce their disposable family income. In this case, the tax would
accomplish the Opposite of what was intended."
