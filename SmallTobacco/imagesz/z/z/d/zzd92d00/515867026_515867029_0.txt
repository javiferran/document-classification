Research Arm of Congress Releases Study
Critical of Proposal To Raise Cigarette Taxes

The Congressional Research Service, the independent research arm of Congress,
has issue a report casting doubt on the wisdom of raising the federal cigarette tax
to pay for President Clinton's plan for government-run health care.

1. Smokers Already Pay Their Fair Share in Social Costs -- Increased health —

costs, sick leave and other expenses smoking imposes on society do not
justify the Clinton Administration's proposed 75 cents per pack cigarette
excise tax hike, CRS says.

— CRS found that existing state and federal cigarette excise taxes, which
average about 50 cents a pack, already cover average estimates of
smoking's so-called “costs imposed by smokers on non-smokers."

— One estimate suggests smoking does not impose any extra costs on non-
smokers. Rather, it provides net savings to the non-smoking population
due to reduced drain on social security and pension payouts.

— The report cited a 1991 study by Willard G. Manning that found the net
external cost per pack of cigarettes was about 16 cents for smokers. It
also looked at a 1989 RAND.Corporation study, which found that, in
1986, each smokers ends up costing society about 15 cents per pack of
cigarettes -- which translates into 21 cents today because of inflation -- but
still below the current 24-cents a pack federal tax, and considerably lower
than the overall average of 50 cents a pack for all federal and state taxes.

— CRS also found the Manning Study made a “much stronger case" for
taxing alcoholic beverages at a higher rate. “An alcohol tax would appear
to be more efficient and more equitable: the best estimate of alcohol's net
external cost exceeds current tax levels; alcohol taxes are also regressive,
but less so than cigarette taxes," the CRS study found.
