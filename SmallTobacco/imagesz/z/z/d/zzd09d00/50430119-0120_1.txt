Grant Application No. 2284 - Page 2

One objection I have to this project is the way the animals
are treated. For example, after anesthesia, the animal will be taped to
a lead brick and allowed to recovery from anesthesia for three or more
hours before administering the radiotracer. He claims that despite this
restraint the rats prepared in this fashion display normal grooming
behavior and explore and drink during the recovery period and the actual
experiment. He quotes Sokoloff to prove that these animals demonstrate
their normal physiological state. I cannot possibly see how rats thus
treated can maintain their proper status.

I find this a highly speculative application. The conclusion
must be very tenuous indeed. Dr. Fenstermacher who is a very
distinguished scientist, has a great deal of funds available. Two NIH
grants do not expire until 1990 and 1991 respectively and another one
for over $1,300,000 has been applied for. He probably has heard by now
what happens to this particular grant which is very similar to that he
applied for, except that nicotine is left out.

I cannot muster much enthusiasm for this study. I suppose it
is in line with many NIH funded studies, relying on indirect methods,
which are probably hard to prove and the results are extremely tenuous.

If we rate this application I would rate it a B- and a B-.
