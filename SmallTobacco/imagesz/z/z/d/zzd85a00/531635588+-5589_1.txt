US. District Court Denies Motion to Dismiss Action Against Distributors and Retailers of Gray Market
Cigarettes

U.S. District Court Judge Charles O. Kocoras today refused to dismiss a lawsuit filed by R.J, Reynolds Tobacco
Company against Premium Tobacco Stores, Inc., d/b/a Cigarettes Cheaper and other distributors and retailers for
selling gray market cigarettes.

Ina 10-page opinion, Judge Kocoras said," ... the Court concludes that these cigarettes [gray market] are not
‘genuine’ to the American consumer and may well cause consumer confusion."

Commenting on the court decision, Guy Blynn, vice president, deputy general counsel and secretary for
Reynolds Tobacco, said, “We hope this ruling sends a strong message to distributors and retailers selling gray
market cigarettes that we will act aggressively to halt this illegal practice.”

Blynn noted thal many gray market cigarettes are stale and have different blend formulations, packaging and
promotional offers than the corresponding brands that are manufactured for sale in the United States. As a result,
he said, "Reynolds has received hundreds of complaints from smokers of Reynolds brands who have been
deceived by these gray market cigarettes.”
