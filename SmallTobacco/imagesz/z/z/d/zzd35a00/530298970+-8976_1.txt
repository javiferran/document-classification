INT'L TOBACCO CONTROL EXPERTS TO MEET IN S.

JOHANNESBURG (Feb. 9) XINHUA - Delegates from 17 countries will meet in Cape Town,
South Africa next week to discuss the economic implications of global tobacco control,
organizers of the meeting said Monday.

Delegates will hold discussions with researchers from the tobacco industry, the organizers said.

The conference would aim to generate policy proposals for South Africa and other countries on
issues of tobacco control, including issues such as taxation, smuggling and employment.

Health ministers from South Africa and Zimbabwe, a major tobacco producer, will participate in
the meeting.

The three-day conference will begin on February 18. It is co-hosted by South Africa’s Medical
Research Council and the University of Cape Town, which is home to the economics of tobacco
control project, launched in early 1996.
