Dear Dr. Nordsiek:

Enclosed for your consideration is the application for our grant, "The Effect of
Smoking on Adaptive Changes of Previable Human Pregnancies." You will note that we
have reduced the total budget by requesting only 15% indirect cost, as required by the
Council, You will also note that approval by our Biomedical Review Committee regarding
our application for the use of human subjects in our Clinical Research Center is pending.
We have every reason to believe that approval will be forthcoming upon request, which will
be initiated upon receipt of the Council's approval of the project.

Thank you for your interest in this project. We look forward to your reply.

Sincerely,

BD mid,
