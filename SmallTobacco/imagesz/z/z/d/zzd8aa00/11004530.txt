Dear Dr. Hockett:

The Hiller Travel Service want to get definite
information with regard to the number of rooms
we want to occupy and from what dates. I

think I know everything about the participants
but I should like to know definitely in regard
to the observers from the Tobacco Research
Council. I understand the Mr Kurt Enslein

will come as an observer and that he will be
the only one. Would you please give me

exact data on how you want him referred to

in the List of Participants which I will send
out within short. Further, would you like me
to put in a reservation for him or do you
prefer to get in touch with the Hiller Travel
Service yourself?

I would appreciate to get your instructions at
your earliest convenience.

Best regards.

Yours sincenely,
pt Â£24-

Lars Friberg, M.D.
