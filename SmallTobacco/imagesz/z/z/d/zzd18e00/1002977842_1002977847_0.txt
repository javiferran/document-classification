“on grades of burley, bright, oriental, ES, ET, DIET, RL, BL, and RCB tobaccos.
Criteria used to evaluate growth and development will be generation time,
larval weight, percentage of adult emergence, fertility, and fecundity of
adults. This data will enable us to respond to requests regarding potential
‘for beetle infestation in these tobaccos, .. New blend concepts (short /medium

would be a basic study of the biology of the cigarette beetle. Recent reports
in the literature indicate mold may have a positive effect on stored-product
insect growth and development. Molds occurring on tobacco will be identified, ‘
cultured, and infoculations of tobacco cultures will be initiated. The same .:
