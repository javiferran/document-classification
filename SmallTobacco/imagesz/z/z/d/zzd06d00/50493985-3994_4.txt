FIG. 3. Mutations in CR1. The amino acid sequence of the HPV16 E7 gene from M-1 to L-15 is shown. Amino acid residues which are
also found in Ad E1A are indicated by shading and boldface type. Deletions are indicated on the left and amino acid substitutions are indicated
on the right. An assessment of the intracellular stability of the mutant proteins is provided by the autoradiographs on the far right. COS-7 cells
were transfected with plasmids expressing the indicated mutations from the SV40 late promoter. In the top panel, cells were metabolically
labeled with ["'S]cysteine and immunoprecipitated. Representative lanes were excised and aligned horizontally according to the position of
the E7 protein as indicated by the arrow. In the bottom panel, transfected COS-7 cells (unlabeled) were immunoprecipitated with an HPV lo
E?7 rabbit polyclonal antiserum, Western blotted with an HPV16 E7 monoclonal antibody (no. 100201; Triton Diagnostics}, and detected with
‘S]-Jabeled goat anti-mouse antiserum. Protein was separated in SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide) gels, and autoradiography was for 1 to 4

 

days. The polypeptide derived from the deletion mutant, p1469, was immunoprecipitated with a mouse monoclonal antibody (7F3} specilte
to the carboxyl terminus of HPV16 E7, which was provided by Triton Diagnostics.

COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids that expressed
the CR2 mutations from the $V40 late promoter. The cells
were lysed under conditions that would be expected to
preserve the pRB-E7? intracellular protein complex. The
protein lysates were then immunoprecipitated with a rabbit
polyclonal antibody to HPV16 E7, washed, and subjected to
SDS-PAGE. After electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose,
coprecipitated pRB was detected by immunoblot analysis as
shown in Fig. 6. On the far left is a positive control in which
pRB was immunoprecipitated with an antibody to pRB from
actively growing COS-7 cells. Transfection with a plasmid
expressing wild-type E7 (p1453) is shown on the far right,
and, as can be seen, a substantial amount of pRB was
immunoprecipitated by the E7 antibody, presumably reflec-
tive of the stable in vivo association between E7 and pRB.
Mutations in the carboxyl end of CR2 within the casein
kinase I] (CKII) domain (p1454, p1646, and p1465) had no
apparent effect on the ability of E7 to associate with pRB. In
contrast, mutations in the previously described pRB binding
domain (p1467, p1457, and p1458) impaired the ability of E7
to associate with pRB in vivo. It had been previously shown
that the mutations within p1467 (D-21 L-22 Y-23 C-24
deletion) and p1458 (E-26 to Q) virtually eliminated the in
vitro association with pRB while the mutation within p1457
(C-24 to S) reduced but did not abolish pRB binding. These

 

data are entirely consistent with those from the in vitro
ouxing experiments (6, 30) and further support the concept
that these are stable, biologically relevant heteromeric pro-
tein complexes. :

The biological data presented in Table 2 confirm that both
ras cooperativity and Ad E2 promoter trans activation
Tequire overlapping sequences within domain 2 for activity.
Mutations in pl458 and pl467 completely abrogated both
biological activities, while the mutation in p1457, which still
retained some pRB binding capacity, exhibited a residual
(35% of wild type) capacity for trans activation but no
apparent transforming activity. These data suggest that the
PRB binding region, and likely the association with pRB
itself, is critical to both transformation and trans-activating

* functions of E7,

E7 phosphorylation. HPV E7 is a phosphoprotein (44) and
is a substrate for CKI phosphorylation (6, 16) at one or
more scrine tesidues (47). The consensus recognition se-
quence of the HPV E7 proteins, which is also found in Ad
E1A and SV40 large T antigen, is conserved within the
carboxyl end of CR2, and in HPV16 E7, the predicted CKII
site is between D-30 and E-37 (DS SEE ED E). Therefore,
a selected set of E7 mutants were analyzed for the ability to
be phosphorylated in vivo in COS-7 cetls. Duplicate plates
were transfected, and one was labeled with [7°S]cysteine and
