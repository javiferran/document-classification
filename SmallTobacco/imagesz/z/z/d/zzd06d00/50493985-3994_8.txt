2426 PHELPS ET AL.

Recent work has indicated that E2F is capable of directly
associating with pRB and cyclin A (2, 4, 11, 12). The ability
of E7 and ELA to specifically associate with pRB would
therefore be expected to play a rale in the modulation of E2F
complexes. The biological relevance of the E7-pRB interac-
lion is supported by the recent studics of Scheffner et al.
(41), which suggcsted that the putative regulatory function of
pRB may be abrogated in transformed cells either by muta-
tion or by association with the HPV E7 protein. The data in
this study indicating that trang activation requires sequences
in domain 2 are consistent with a role for PRB binding in
transcriptional activation mediated through the E2F tran-
scription factor. The E2F cellular transcription factor is
necessary for activation of the Ad E2 promoter and is
believed to play a role in the control of cell cycle-regulated
genes such as c-myc, Both cellular transformation and
érans-activation functions of E? require amino acid se-
quences important for pRB association, suggesting that E2F
displacement or activation may play a critical role in both
activities. Indeed, E7 trans activation may represent the
activation of one component, E2F, of a pathway that, during
virus infection, results in the induction of cellular prolifera-
tion. Transcriptional trans activation by HPV E7 may be
more complicated, as recent studies indicate that low-risk
HPY E? proteins which are defective for transformation or

immortalization (19, 29) and PRB binding (30) can still

efficiently trans activate the Ad E2 promoter (31).

Cellular transformation and transcriptional trans activa-
tion require overlapping sequences in CR2. The precise roles
of CRI sequences and the CKIT recognition site in CR2 in
transformation and trans activation are less well understood.
Mutations described in this study suggest that there are
sequences in CRI which are required for transformation but
not for pRB association. In addition, phosphorylation at the
CKH recognition site or the inherent structure of the region
itself may play some role in E7-mediated transcriptional
activation. Future studies of the additional proteins which
interact with E7 during the cell cycle and further studies of
the mechanism of E2F activation are likely to elucidate the
roles of these regions in the function of E7.
