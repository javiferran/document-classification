Recombinant plasmid DNAs. Mutations in the HPV16 E7
gene resulting in amino acid substitutions and deletions were
generated by oligonucleotide reconstruction essentially as
described previously (28, 45}. A schematic diagram of this
process is shown in Fig. 2. Bricfly, overlapping synthetic
oligonucleotides of specified sequence were treated with
polynuc-leotide kinase and annealed between the Nsil (nu-
cleotide 565) and Banil (nucleotide 711) sites in the amino
half and the BanII and Ncol (nucleotide 863) sites in the
carboxyl half of the gene. Mutations were then verificd by
DNA sequence analysis, and the DNAs were recloned into
the p1059 plasmid (37), which encodes the entire early region
of the HPV16 genome downstream of the SV40 early pro-
moter. In addition, mutated E7 genes were cloned into the
SV40 late promoter vector pSVL (Pharmacia, Inc.) by
polymerase chain reaction amplification and incorporation of
new restriction enzyme sites for Xhol and BamHI. The
integrity of these clones was again verified by DNA se-
quence analysis. Ad type 5 pE2CAT (21) and pEJRAS
expressing the activated ras oncogene (33) have been previ-
ously described.

Mammalian cell transfections. DNA transfections for tran-
sient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays were
performed by calcium phosphate coprecipitation as previ-
ously described (35) by using a total of 10 to 15 pg of DNA
per 60-mm dish (normally 5 wg of CAT plasmid plus 5 to 10
ug of E7 expression plasmid}. At 4 h after addition of the
DNA precipitate, the cells were treated with 15% glycerol
for 1 min, washed twice with fresh medium, and incubated in
complete medium containing 5 mM sodium butyrate (pH 7.0)
for 48 h. For transformation assays, primary baby rat kidney
cells were transfected 2 days after plating with 5 pg of each
DNA for a total of 10 4g/60-mm dish as previously described
(37). Precipitates were allowed to sit on the cells overnight,
and the plates were refed the next day. For analysis of
pratein stability, COS-7 cells were transfected with 60 yg of
Lipofectin (GIBCO BRL) and 6 pg of DNA (10:1) per
100-mm dish overnight in Opti-Mem I (GIBCO BRL) and
refed with Dulbecco modified Eagle medium with 10% fetal
bovine serum,

Metabolic labeling of cells. Approximately 72 h after trans-
fection, cells were starved for either cysteine or phosphate
for 1 b and labeled for 1.5 h with either [*°S|cysteine (0.5
mCi/100-mm plate) or [°?P}P, (1 mCi/100-mm plate). Cells
were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and lysed in either radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) buffer (20 mM morpholinepropanesulfonic acid
[MOPS], pH 7.0; 150 mM NaCl; 1% [vol/vol] Nonidet P-40;
1% [vol/vol] deoxycholate; 0.1% [wt/vol] sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS); 1 mM EDTA; 100 yg of aprotinin per ml; 100
eg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride per ml; 100 pg of
No-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone per ml; 100 yg of
tolylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone [TPCK] or
EIA extraction buffer (50 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-
N’-2-ethanesulfonic acid [HEPES], pH 7.0; 0.1% Nonidet
P-40; 250 mM NaCl; protease inhibitors [Sigma Chemical
Co.}) per mi as described above.

Antibodies. Polyclonal rabbit antisera (1:500) to the
HPV16 E7 protein expressed in Escherichia coli (32a) was
used to immunoprecipitate the E7 protein, and mouse mono-
clonal antibody no. 100201 to HPV16 E7 (Triton Diagnos-
tics, Alameda, Calif.) was used for Western blot (immuno-
blot) analysis of protein stability in COS-7 cells. For Western
blot analysis of pRB protcin, a mouse monoclonal antibody,
PMG3-245.11 (PharMingen), was used at 10 pg/ml. _

Immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations from **S- or

HPVté E7 MUTAGENESIS 2419

*P-labeled cell lysates were performed by incubation with
antisera overnight (0°C). Immune complexes were collected
by incubation (4°C) with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B for 30
min with rocking. The immune complexes were then washed
twice with cold RIPA buffer plus protease inhibitors, once
with a high-salt buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 12.5 mM
dithiothreitol; 6.25 mM CaCl; 500 mM NaCl) at 37°C for 30
min and once with TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 1 mM
EDTA). Immune complexes were then resuspended in sam-
ple buffer and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophore-
sis (PAGE).

Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitated protein scpa-
rated on polyacrylamide gels was electroblotted to nitrocel-
lulose at 40 V for 2 h in 12.5 mM Trizma-100 mM glycine,
pH 8.3. The membranes were blocked (5% nonfat dry milk;
10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 2.5 mM EDTA; 50 mM NaC]; 0.1%
Tween 20) for 1 h, incubated in fresh blocking buffer plus
monoclonal antibody (no. 100201; Triton Diagnostics) for
>1.5 h, and washed five times with PBS-0.1% Tween 20.
Detection of mouse monoclonal antibodies was with '5I-
labeled goat anti-mouse antiserum (Amersham Corp.).

CAT assays. CAT assays were performed as previously
described (46). Cell extracts were incubated with [“4C|chlo-
tamphenicol ($0 mCi/mmol; Amersham Corp.) and 4 mM
acetyl coenzyme A (Pharmuciu, Inc.) in 250 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.8) at 37°C for 0. t 2.0 h. The products of the
acetylation reaction were separated by ascending thin-layer
chromatography, localized by autoradiography, and quanti-
tated by liquid scintillation after excision of the spots. Cell
lysates were assayed for total protein concentration with the
Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) so that cach
CAT reaction was conducted with equivalent amounts of
protein (2() pg).

RESULTS

The amino-terminal 43 residues of the E7 proteins of the
genital tract-associated HPVs possess a striking sequence
similarity to portions of CRI and CR2 of Ad EIA (Fig. 1,
top) (37). The integrity of these domains is required for most
of the transformation functions of E1A (32). Although the
sequences in the carboxyl half of E7 are well conserved
among the HPVs, this region possesses no substantial amino
acid sequence similarity to any part of ELA with the excep-
tion of repeated Cys-X-X-Cys motifs, which are also found
in CR3 of EIA (Fig. 1, bottom). In this study, mutations in
the amino terminus of HPV16 E7 were constructed on the
basis of the homology to ELA; mutations in the carboxyl
terminus were based on conserved amino acids among the
genital tract-associated HPVs. The E7 regions correspond-
ing to Ad EJA CRI and CR2 are referred to in this study as
domains 1 and 2; the carboxyl portion of E? (amino acids 38
to 98) is referred to as domain 3.

Construction of HPV16 E7 mutations. A scrics of specific
mutations were created in the HPV16 E7 gene as depicted in
Fig. 2. Mutations, including amino acid substitutions, dele-
tions, and the introduction of premature termination codons,
were created by oligonucleotide reconstruction between the
Nsil, Banll, and Neol sites. In most cases, the amino acid
substitutions were chosen to introduce relatively conserva-
tive changes that might not be expected to severely disrupt
the overall structure of the protein.

The effect of amino acid changes on the intracellular
stability of the E7 protein was assessed by expression of the
altered proteins from the SV40 late promoter in COS-7 cells.
Transfected cells were metabolically labeled with (*S]eys-
