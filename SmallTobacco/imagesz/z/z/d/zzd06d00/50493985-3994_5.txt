one was labeled with *#P,. The *°S-labeled profiles demon-
strate that roughly equivalent amounts of each of the pro-
teins were expressed tn vive after transfection (Fig. 7, top).
The bottom panel of Fig. 7 is an autoradiograph of *-P-
labeled proteins, and the position of the E7 protein is
indicated by the arrow. A wild-type control (p1453) is shown
on the far right, and a mock-transfected negative control is
shown on the far left. As expected, alteration in the CKII
recognition sequence, p1454 (E-35 to Q) or p1465 (E-35 D-36
E-37 deletion), significantly reduced the ability of the protein
to be phosphorylated in vivo. In addition, deletion of the
putative target serine residues (S-31 $-32) in pl646 com-
pletely eliminated E7 phosphorylation in vivo, confirming
that one or both of these serines are the major sites of
phosphorylation. In contrast, deletion of the pRB binding
sequences in p1467 had no effect on the ability of E7 to be
phosphorylated, and substitution of S-71 (S-71 to C), a
conserved scrine in the carboxyl portion of E7, also had no
effect on phosphorylation, indicating that it is not a site for
serine phosphorylation. :

Examination of the biological activities of the CKII muta-
tions (Table 2) indicated that phosphorylation-negative mu-
tants were unaffected in their transformation function as-
sayed by ras cooperativity; however, trans activation was
reduced somewhat in pl465 (56% of wild-type) and pl646
(65% of wild type). Therefore, phosphorylation of the serine
residues in CR2 by CKII is not essential for either the
transformation or the trans-activation functions of E7.

DISCUSSION

In this study, a series of mutations in the HPV16 E7
protein were gencrated and assayed for their effects on
intracellular protein stability, the ability to cooperate with
ras in transformation of BRK cells, the ability to activate the
Ad E2 promoter, pRB association, and phosphorylation.
The goal of this work was to provide a better definition of the
functional domains of the HPV16 E7 oncoprotein involved in
transformation and transcriptional trans activation.

Previous genetic studies indicated that two conserved
regions of Ad E1A, CRI and CR2, are necessary for the
functions involved in cellular transformation, including the
stimulation of host cellular DNA synthesis, cellular immor-
talization, ras cooperativity, pRB association, and transcrip-
tional repression (9, 24, 32, 56). These functional domains
are physically distinct from CR3 of E1A, which has been
shown to be the primary determinant of E1A-mediated trans
activation (25, 27, 55).

Although the major frans-activating domain of E1A has
been identified as CR3, a number of studies have indicated
that the 243-amino acid product of the 128 ELA mRNA,
which contains the transforming domains (CR1 and CR2) but
not CR3, has frans-activation properties (10, 32). The 12S
E1A product will activate a subset of the promoters that are
responsive to ELA (12S plus 13S), including the Ad E2
promoter. Activation of the Ad E2 promoter by 12S E1A is
at least in part mediated by alteration of heteromeric protein
