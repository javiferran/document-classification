suggest that the primary effect of mutations in the carboxyl
terminus result from structural perturbations that affect the
intracellular stability of the protein. ’

It has been recently suggested that alterations of the CKII
site preferentially affect trans-activation (6) and transforma-
tion functions (16). The role of serine phosphorylation or of
the amino acids comprising the CKII site itself is not clear;
hawever, the data presented in this study indicate that
phosphorylation itself is not essential for transformation or
transcriptional regulatory functions of the protein. However,
the mutated E7 proteins that were poor substrates for
phosphorylation (pl465 and p1646) were slightly impaired
for trans activation of the Ad E2 promoter (56 and 65% of the
wild type, respectively). The mutant pl454, which was
wild-type in trans activation, demonstrated a much-reduced
ability to be phosphorylated, suggesting that a high level of
phosphorylation per se is not required. It is important that
mutations in the CKII site did not alter the ability of E7 to
interact with the pRB protein, indicating that substantial
structural perturbations were not introduced by these muta-
tions, and further, that in vivo phosphorylation plays no
direct role in the association of E7 and pRB. Furthermore,
mutations in the CKIT domain described in this study do nat
substantially alter the acidic nature of this region (16). Thus,
if maintenance of the negative charge in this domain is
important, the deletions and amino acid substitutions de-
scribed in this work would not have substantially altered this

property.

FIG. 6. pRB binding. Transfected COS-7 cells were lysed and
immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antisera to HPV16 E7. Immune
Precipitates were run on SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide) gels,
electroblotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with a monoclonal
antibody to human pRB. Detection was with “I-labeled goat
anti-mouse antiserum. Autoradiography was for 2 to 4 days.

FIG. 7. Phosphorylation of E7 mutants. Transfected COS-7 cells

Mutations in the carboxy] terminus of E7 generally af-
fected the intracellular stability of the polypeptide. Both
EIA and the HPV E7? proteins contain Cys-X-X-Cys motifs
that have been implicated in the coordination of Zn** atoms.
At least two functions, DNA binding activity (8) and protein
dimerization (17), have been ascribed to polypeptide do-
mains containing zinc thiolate complexes. As yet, there is no
evidence that E7 is capable of sequence-specific DNA bind-
ing, and the role of Zn** chelation in E7 dimerization has not
yet been explored. With the extended distance (30 amino
acids) between the Cys-X-X-Cys motifs in E7, this protein is
unlikely to form a classical zinc finger structure as originally
proposed for transcription factor Illa (26). Nevertheless, the
zinc thiolate complex may be important for the structural
integrity of the E7 protein. Recent studies with chimeric
HPV6 and HPV16 E7 proteins have also shown that the
carboxyl-terminal regions of both high- and low-risk E7
proteins are interchangeable and thus functionally equiva-
lent (31). Therefore, substitutions which disrupt this frame-
work would be expected to severely alter the tertiary struc-
ture of the protein. In this work, the deletion or substitution
of cysteine residues in the carboxyl terminus generally
resulted in an unstable, biologically inactive protein.
