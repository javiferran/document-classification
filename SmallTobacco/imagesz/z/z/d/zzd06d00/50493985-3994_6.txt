complexes containing the cellular uanscription factor E2F
(1). The frans-activating properties of the HPV16 E7 protein
are quite similar to those described for 12S E1A. HPV16 E7
mediates transcriptional trans activation through the E2F
transcription factor, and E7, like EIA, can disrupt cellular
protein complexes containing E2F (34). ”

The point mutations in domain 1 of E7 assayed in this
study had no effect on transformation (p1460 and p1461);
however, deletion of five conserved amino acids, PTLHE
(p1469), completely eliminated the ability of E? to cooperate
with ras. This deletion has no effect on the ability of E7 to
associate with pRB in vitro (30). These results indicate that
domain 1 plays a crucial role in cellular transformation
independent of pRB binding and further indicate that al-
though pRB binding is required for ras cooperativity, it alone
is not sufficient. These data are in agreement with. other

analyses, indicating a critical role for CRI sequences of ELA
(54) and of HPV16 E7 (3) in transformation that do not affect
PRB association.

Although previous analyses of the HPV16 E7 protein
determined that domains I and 2 are required for transfor-
mation, the domains of the protein involved in grams activi
tion have not been well delineated. Some mutational analy-
Ses indicated that the integrity of domain 2 is important for
trans activation (15, 36); however, other studies concluded
that either the entire polypeptide (51) or simply the carboxyl
terminus (39) is required for érans activation. The results of
the present study clearly indicate that it is the integrity of the
CR2 sequences that is critical to rrans-activation activity and
