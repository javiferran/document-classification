The E7 gene of human papillomavirus type 16 encodes a multifunctional nuclear phosphoprotein that is
functionally and structurally similar to the adenovirus (Ad} ELA proteins and the T antigens of other
papovaviruses. E7 can cooperate with an activated ras oncogene to transform primary rodent cells, trans
activate the Ad E2 promoter, and abrogate transforming growth factor B-mediated repression of c-myc. Recent
studies suggest that these functions may in part be a consequence of the ability of E7 to associate with the
product of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (pRB). In this study, a series of site-specific mutations of
the human papillomavirus type 16 E7 gene product were constructed and assessed for their effects on
intracellular protein stability, ras cooperativity, transcriptional trans activation, pRB association, and
phosphorylation. The results of these studies indicate that the transforming and frans-activating domains
extensively overlap within a region of the protein analogous to conserved region 2 of Ad E1A, suggesting that
pRB binding is necessary for both activities. Deletion of sequences in conserved region | abrogates cellular
transformation but has only a marginal effect on frans activation. These data suggest that E7 trans activation

and cellular transformation are interrelated but separable functions.

 

Both epidemiological and biological data support the divi-
sion of the mucosa-associated human papillomaviruses
(HPYs) into two groups: those associated with benign Ie-
sions, including condyloma acuminata, which are at low risk
for malignant progression (HPV type 6 [HPV6] and HPV11),
and those represented by HPV16 and HPVI8, which are
considered high risk because of their association with intra-
epithelial neoplasia, a precursor to cervical cancer (37). The
E7 proteins of the high-risk HPVs, which are consistently
expressed in HPV-positive cervical carcinomas and derived
cell lines (3, 42, 43), can induce morphological transforma-
tion of established rodent cells in culture (7, 22, 37, 49, 50,
52). E7 also can cooperate with an activated ras or fos
oncogene to transform primary rodent cells (37, 48}. The
expression of the high-risk HPV E6 and E7 proteins together
can efficiently induce immortalization of primary human
epithelial cells (19, 20, 29).

The HPV16 E7 protein is an acidic 21-kDa nuclear phos-
phoprotein with no known enzymatic activity. The amino
terminus of the HPV E7 protcin shares substantial amino
acid sequence similarity with two noncontiguous portions of
the adenovirus (Ad) ELA proteins (37). In addition, E7 is
functionally related to ELA and simian virus 40 (SV40) large
T antigen in that it can cooperate with ras, trans activate the
Ad E2 promoter (37), and abrogate the transforming growth
factor B-induced transcriptional repression of the c-mye
promoter in keratinocytes (38). The amino acid sequences in
conserved region 2 (CR2) of each of these oncoproteins are
required for their association with pRB, the product of the
retinoblastoma tumor susceptibility gene (5, 6, 13, 14, 30, 53,
54).

Previous genetic studies indicated that CR1 and CR2 are
required for E1A cellular transformation functions, including
stimulation of host DNA synthesis, cooperation with ras,
pRB association, and transcriptional repression of certain

genes. In contrast, CR3 of ELA, which is present in the
product of the Ad E1A 13S RNA but not in the product of
the 12S RNA, is responsible for the major E1A-mediated
transcriptionul runs-activation function (9, 10, 32). Amino
acid sequences that are similar to that of Ad ELA CR3 are
not present in SV40O T antigen or in the E7 proteins of the
HPVs, suggesting that this transcriptional regulatory region
is unique to ELA,

A recent analysis of HPV16 E7 trans activation indicated
that the binding sites for the cellular transcription factor E2F
are necessary for activation af the Ad E2 promoter by both
E7 and EIA. Recent studies have indicated that.the E2F
transcription factor is a cellular target for the pRB protein (2,
11, 12), The E7 protein is functianally similar to the 12S ELA
product in that it can perturb the association of E2F with
cellular proteins, including cyclin A and pRB (34).

In this study, a scries of HPV16 E? mutants were analyzed
to map the domains involved in the transcriptional trans
activation and cellular transformation functions of the E7
gene product. These data suggest that for HPV E7, cellular
transformation and trans activation of the Ad E2 promoter
are related but separable functions. Cellular transformation
required two separate regions analogous to the Ad ELA CRI
and CR2 domains, and transcriptional trans activation
mapped to an overlapping region of the CR2 domain.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell culture. African green monkey kidney CV-1 cells and
COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL 1651) were maintained in Dulbecco
modified Eagle medium with 10% fetal bovine scrum supple-
mented with penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100
pe/ml). Primary baby rat kidney cells were prepared from
6-day-old Fischer rats as previously described (40). The
kidneys were finely minced and digested with collagenase
and dispase. Approximately 3 x 10° to S x 10° cells were
plated in 60-mm dishes and grown in the medium described
above.
