teine, and the E? protein was immunoprecipitated with a
polyclonal rabbit antiserum. In addition, Western blot anal-
ysis of unlabeled, immunoprecipitated E7 protein was used
to confirm the relative levels of stable E7 protein that
resulted from introduction of the various amino acid alter-
ations. Under these conditions, [*>S]cysteine labeling was a
more sensitive method for detection of transiently expressed
E7 protein. Data from representative protein gels arc shawn
for each domain, and although somewhat different gel con-
ditions and immunoprecipitation washes were employed for
some experiments, a reconstructed wild-type E7 was always
included as an internal control.

Stability of HPV16 E7 mutants. The amino acid mutations
in domains 1, 2, and 3 are depicted in Fig. 3, 4, and 5,
respectively. Amino acids which are conserved with respect
to Ad EIA are indicated by solid circles. The two point
mutants in Fig. 3, pl460 and pl461, make comparable
amounts of stable E7 protein compared with a reconstructed
wild type, indicating that any biological effect is not a result
of gross alteration of the intracellular stability of the mutated
protein. By contrast, substitution of a single valine residuc’
for D-14 and L-15 in p1468 which is analogous to that
described for E1A (23) resulted in an unstable protein which
was undetectable by either *S labeling or Western blot
analysis. The deletion mutant (P-6 T-7 L-8 H-9 E-10), p1469,
which has been previously described (30), also was found to
encode a stable polypeptide.

The introduction of various mutations into domain 2 of the
E7 protein (Fig. 4) led to a substantial reduction in protein

stability in only one cuse, that of pl455 (S-32 to C). Each of
the other amino acid substitutions and deletions did not
significantly reduce the intracellular stability of the protein.

Amino acid changes in the carboxyl terminus of the E7
polypeptide (Fig. 5} in many instances resulted in unstable
proteins. Substitution or deletion of cysteine residues
(p1650, pl651, p1656, and p1660) resulted in an unstabic
protein that could not be detected by either **S labeling or
Western blotting (data not shown). Deletions of six to eight
amino acids in pl657, p1658, and p1639 each resulted in a
partial reduction in protein stability; however, the deletion
of the carboxyl-terminal Cys-X-X-Cys motif, p1660, had the
most profound effect an the level of stable protein, since
litle or no E7 could be detected. The amino acid substitu-
tions in pl647, p1648, and pl649 were not assessed for
protein stability, although, as will be discussed below, they
were fully wild type in their biological characteristics, sug-
gesting that they made stable E7 proteins. The introduction
of premature termination codons resulting in the deletion of
as few as nine amino acids (I-89 to stop) resulted in biolog-
ically inactive mutant proteins presumably because of re-
duced polypeptide stability (data not shown). These muta-
tions were not analyzed further.

Biological activity of the E7 mutant proteins. Each of the
stable, mutated’ proteins was then assessed for biological
activity (Tables 1 to 3). The two point mutations in domain 1.
pl460 and pl461, demonstrated a wild-type capacity for
cooperation with an activated ras oncogene in the transfor-
mation of BRK cells in three separate experiments, Further-
