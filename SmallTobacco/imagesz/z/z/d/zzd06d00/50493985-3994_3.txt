RAS Coaperativily
Transactivation

FIG. 2. A schematic diagram of the mutagenesis. Site-specific mutations were created in HPV16 E7 by oligonucleotide reconstruction
between the NsiI and BartlIl sites in the N terminus and between the Baall and Nol sites in the C terminus. Annealed oligonucleotides were
cloned into pUC19 or pTZ19, and mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Selected mutant E7 genes were subcloned into the
entire early region of HPV16 positioned downstream of the SV40 early promoter or in the SV40 late promoter vector pSVL.

more, these amino acid changes had little or no effect on the
trans-activation function of E7, showing 100 and 79% af
wild-type activity, respectively. The deletion mutant p1469
possessed interesting biological properties in that it was
completely inactive in ras cooperativity but retained sub-
stantial trans-activating capacity (70% of wild type). These
data indicate that the trans-activation and transformation
functions can be separated because ras cooperativity, but
not the frans-activation property, requires an intact domain
lL.

Examination of the biological activity of the domain 2
mutations (Table 2) revealed a good correlation between
trans activation and ras cooperativity in this domain. Muta-
tions that did not severely impair the ¢rans-activating func-
tion of E?, including p1454 (E-35 to Q), pl646 (S-31 S-32
deletion), and p1465 (E-35 D-36 E-37 deletion), had no effect
on ras cooperativity. In contrast, alterations in the NH,-
terminal half of domain 2 eliminated both the trans-activat-
ing and transforming functions: pl457 (C-24 to S), p1458
(E-26 to Q), and p1467 (D-21 L-22 Y-23 C-24 deletion). These
data indicate that amino acid sequences critical for both the
trans-activating and transforming functions of E7 essentially
overlap in the NH,-terminal portion of domain 2. This region
was previously identified as critical to the ability of E7 to
interact with the pRB (5, 6, 30). Alterations in the C terminus
of domain 2 selectively reduced the levels of trans activa-
tion, suggesting that these sequences play some indirect role
in transcriptional activation of the Ad E2 promoter.

In domain 3, there was generally a very good correlation
between ras cooperativity and the ability of E7 to trans

activate the Ad E2 promoter (Table 3). E7 mutants that had
wild-type levels of trans activation (pl647, p1648, p1649,
p1653, and p1654) possessed essentially wild-type transfor-
mation activities. In contrast, those amino acid changes that
resulted in a substantial reduction in trans-activation levels
(p1652, pl657, p1658, and p1659) had a diminished capacity
to cooperate with an activated ras oncogene. In each case,
as shown in Fig. 3, these latter mutations which diminished
the biological activity of the E7 protein also substantially
reduced the intracellular protein stability. One exception in
domain 3, p1655, (L-82 L-83 to R R) can be noted. This
mutant E7 polypeptide was stable and possessed good
transformation capacity but was reduced in its trans-activat-
ing capacity (approximately 39% of wild type). This suggests
that these leucine residues, which are well conserved in the
E7 proteins of other genital tract-associated HPVs, play
some direct or indirect structural role in the trans-activating
function that is not important to the transformation func-
tions.

In vivo pRB binding. In a previous study, domain 2 was
found to be responsible for the ability of HPV16 E7 to
associate with the pRB protein (30). That work also demon-
strated that the E7 proteins from the genital tract-associated
HPVs exhibit various capacities for the direct association
with pRB depending on whether the E7 protein is encoded
by a high-risk virus (such as HPV16 or HPV18) or a low-risk
virus (such as HPV6 or HPV11) (18, 30). To further evaluate
the role of this domain in pRB association, the domain 2
mutants of HPV16 E7 were examined for the capacity to
associate with pRB in vivo.
