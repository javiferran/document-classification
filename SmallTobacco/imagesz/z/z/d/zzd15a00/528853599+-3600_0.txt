Charlie,

The increase in nitrate from our blends could be attributed to increase in by-products in
the DORAL family versus Winston family. Both burley and flue-cured stems have higher
nitrate levels than their leaf counterparts. I would expect higher by-products to also be
used in competitive lower-priced products.
