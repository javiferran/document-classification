Subject: RE; MA Compliance Retain Samples
Susan-

Claire raises a good point re records retention. You should review your functional records retention schedule and
make determinations about whether the samples you describe are under disposal suspension. lf they are, they
must be retained until the disposal suspension is listed. If they are not, they must be retained in accordance with
your retention schedule. If you have questions about the application of the schedule, contact your records
coordinator or Lewis Cummings. They can coordinate as necessary with other records management resources
within PM. Thanks.
