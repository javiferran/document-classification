Jeanne,

| have enclosed the final version of the Chain Volume Request. We have
labeled this as request number B1060. It was produced from the MCP SAS
History week ending 9/26/98.

There were some changes made to the request.

* We changed the completeness store count to include active and completeness
checks for 65 out of 65 weeks. This is just a store count and does not have
an impact on the volume reported.

* We were unable to provide the Retail Masters Y/N column. This was
excluded fram the report.

* The total store counts for 1997 and 1998 are calculated based on the
current definition of the stores within a chain. This means that the

stores associated with the chain in the current time period will be the same
stores checked on the 1997 history. We do not keep old assignments of

retail ids to a particular chain. Therefore there would not be a difference
between the counts. We created one column with the total STARS stores and
another based on the Retail Masters stores.

* The CPW values are based on the average per chain within a week. We
pulled the data from LINQ and collapsed it by chain. Then that value was
divided by the total number of retail ids within the chain.

If you have any questions, just let me know.

Sandy
