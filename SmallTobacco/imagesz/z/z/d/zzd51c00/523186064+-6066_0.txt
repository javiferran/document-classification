INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM

    

Subject: Strip & Cut Filler Processing Date: March 1, 1984

Committee ~ Meeting Minutes

To: Committee Members From: H. C. Threatt

The group previously calling itself the "Maximizing Acceptable Cigarettes
per Pound" Committee met February 29, 1984. Those attending were Hoyt Beard,
Jim Dickerson, Wayne Fulp, Bobby Hardin, Floyd Lockamy, Don Lamonds, John
McKenzie, Jim Phillips, Dan Pugh, and Harold Threatt. The agenda for the
meeting is attached (see Attachment 1).

I, Previous Meeting Minutes

There were no changes to the minutes of the last meeting.

Il. Project List

The committee discussed the updated project list, a copy of which is
included with these minutes. Several good points were made for improving the
list:

Clarify ST (short term) and LT (long term)

Place the date on the list

Update in time to have a newly revised list for each meeting
Number the pages.

The group felt that several areas not presently involved should receive
copies of the list - Leaf Buying, Leaf Processing, and Facilities Development,
for example. Copying the Leaf and Blends Subcommittee membere will be a big
help in getting proper distribution.

Actions required in maintaining the project list are:

1. Corrections/changes need to be sent to Harold Threatt by March 14,

2. Latest corrected project list to be sent to committee members by
March 21.

3. Committee members should come prepared to address any errors at
March 28 meeting.

Ill, "Maker" Projects From Manufacturing Engineering

Don Lamonds attended the meeting for the first time. The committee felt
that it would be good to include projects in Manufacturing Engineering having
to do with maker improvements. Don will provide these for addition to the
list. His projects are mainly quality related, but they fit the criterion
because of the reduction in the number of rejects, etc.
