It takes teamwork to prevent
cigarette sales to minors.

Preventing cigarette sales to minors is not a job anyone can do
alone. We all have a role to play in this effort—-parents, teachers, store
owners, state and local officials and, of course, tobacco companies.

At Philip Morris USA, we're teaming up with retailers, wholesalers
and other major tobacco manufacturers in support of an ambitious
program. called “We Card.” It is providing stores across the country with
signs and educational materials to promote awareness of minimum-age
laws and the importance of checking ID.

We're also supporting the passage of state legislation to better
enforce existing minimum-age laws.

What can you do to help?

Become familiar with your state’s minimum-age laws. Don’t buy
cigarettes for minors. And don’t send minors to buy cigarettes for you.

Teamwork can make the difference.
