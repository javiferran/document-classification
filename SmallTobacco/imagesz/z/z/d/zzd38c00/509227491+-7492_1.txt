FIELD MARKETING MANAGER MEDIA GUIDELINES

o Field marketing managers should not respond to questions
from the media about Reynolds Tobacco or its programs.

Example: How does the LBO affect the company's marketing
program?

I am sorry but that is not my area of expertise.
I will be happy to provide you with the name of
someone at Reynolds Tobacco's headquarters who
ean help you.

What kind of promotional support does RJR give
its marketing programs?

I can provide you with the name and telephone
number of someone who can answer that question.

Â°o Managers may, using best judgement, respond to questions
about the event they are sponsoring. Managers should be
aware that reporters tend to let their questions drift into
"red flag" areas and thus, managers should be sensitive to
interview questions.

Example: How long will this event last? Where will it
take place?

Answer basic questions about the event (i.e.)
event will last from & p.m. until midnight and
will take place on the XYZ Plaza.

How many other events will RJR do with this Base?
Why has RJR become so involved with the military?
Isn't this considered target marketing?

This is an example of how questions can stray.
Do not attempt to answer these questions. Refer
to Winston-Salen.
