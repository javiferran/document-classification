B&H Heavy Spending

This is the final report evaluating the B&H Heavy-up test which began in
August 1984 in Shreveport, Seattle, Lubbock and Fresno. October

will be the last month of data reported due to the Merit Box
introduction in November which took most of the available media that
month.

Spending Levels

While spending for the total brand has doubled, the increase is applied
to Lights in Lubbock and Fresno, and DUL in Seattle and Shreveport. As
such, spending on those packings has essentially tripled, while spending
on the remaining packings has changed very little. Below is a summary
of the spending in each market.

B&H Dollar Expenditure
(000)

Fresno Lubbock Seattle Shreveport

1983 local expenditures $ 137 $ 112 $ 579 $ 134
Previous 1984 projected 145 111 624 128
Current 1984 projected 275 215 1,213 243
Current indexed to previous 190 194 194 130

Market Share

After three months of data, this test cannot be adequately evaluated.
However, at this point in time, the extra spending has had no effect on
B&H. Share changes in the test markets as well as the total U.S. are
insignificant (confidence interval is 95%).
