PHILIP MORRIS, U.S.A. INTEROFFICE CORRESPONDENCE
120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10017

TO: Renee Simons DATE: July 3, 1986

FROM: Susan Reich

SUBJECT: Status of Direct Marketing Intercept Pieces

Based on a meeting I had with Ray Pokarnay of Leo Burnett on

Wednesday afternoon, the following is the revised schedule for
all PM intercept pieces:

-Legal wording/expiration dates on coupons due to Philip

Morris: Thursday, 7/3
-Art and keyline due to Leo Burnett: Monday, 7/14
-Film to printer: Monday, 7/21

This schedule was jointly determined by Barbara Reuter and Ray
Pokarnay. Barbara also informed me that she is issuing a

detailed memo this afternoon to all Brand Managers regarding this
revised schedule.

In addition, Ray said that the 5th color (silver gray) can be
included on the Benson & Hedges intercept piece.

Please call if you have any questions. .
