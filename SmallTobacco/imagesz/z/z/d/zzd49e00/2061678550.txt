RECORDS RETENTION PROGRAM - PM INT'L - HEADQUARTERS ACCOUNTING

Attached is the Records Retention Schedule for your office.

It has been approved by James Breedlove, Legal Counsel for
compliance with legal requirements.

Annually, the records should be reviewed and forwarded to
the off-site storage center or destroyed in compliance with
the Schedule. This practice will minimize file space
requirements at the World Headquarters building.

Please call me on extension 4019 for further assistance.
