I received requests for several Newport Neon Signs from my Sales Reps. After
personally viewing each location for outside traffic and competition for window space, I
am requesting only one sign.

Marathon Gas

27745 Orchard Lake Rd.
Farmington Hills, MI 48334
Terr, #22 Route Call #5K
Ind. Vol. 120

The placement would be in an uncluttered front window on the corner of Orchard Lake
and 12 Mile Roads. This intersection was recently named the busiest in Oakland County.

Please advise if this location is acceptable. Thank you.
