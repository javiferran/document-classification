12 et sey, Bridged-chain derivatives may. be represented by struc-
tures like. the bicyclic ether 1,4-cineole while monocyclic aryl de-
rivatives may: be represented by compounds. like benzaldehyde
propylene glycol acetal or 3-phenyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde.

12. Is it. heteroaromatic (BY? 22 13, RN. FY
This question separates the aromatic heterocyclics for the purpose “s *o

16. Is it a common terpene (D)-hydrocarbon, -alcohol,, -aldehyde { 17 ; I un
or -carboxylic acid! (not a ketone)? \f
Questions 16.and 17: deal with terpenes. A hydrocarbon: terpene ~ YES.
that is a common terpene (D): and has not already been puti in NO (Class
class I by question 5, would go into class I by. question 16. (17) I)
17,.Is the substance readily hydrolysed (H) to.a common terpene { 19 18 9, CH3ON | OCHs

(D), -alcohol, -aldehyde or -carboxylic acid? (If the answer is

yes, treat the hydrolysed residues: separately, and proceed to 18 La a
for the terpene moiety and to 19 for any non-terpenoid moiety.)

Since there may:be substances that are hydrolysed to.two or more

residues, one of which is a terpene, treat. the residues. separately NO YES

from question 18 onward to conclusion. (19) (18 & 19)
18..Is the substance one of the following:: d OCH,

(a) a vicinal diketone; or a ketone or ketal of a ketone I " CHyG—~CH=CHe

attached to. a terminal vinyl group occ

(b). a secondary: alcohol’ or ester of a secondary alcohol i 3

attached to a terminal vinyl group

(c) allyl alcohol or its acetal, ketal or ester derivative NO YES

(d) allyl mercaptan, an allyl sulphide, an allyl! thioester (Class (Class

or allyl amine D 1)

(e) acrolein, a methacrolein or their acetals

(f) acrylic or methacrylic acid

(g).an acetylenic compound

(h) an acyclic aliphatic (A) ketone, ketal or ketoalcohol. with
no other functional groups and with four or more carbons
on either side of the keto group

(i) a substance in which the functional groups (E) are all steri-
cally hindered (J).
