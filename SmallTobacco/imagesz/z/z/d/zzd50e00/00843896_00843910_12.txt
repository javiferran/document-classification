Question 18 examines. the terpenes (and later the open-chain
and. mononuclear substances by. reference) to determine whether
they contain certain structural features. generally thought to be

associated! with some enhanced toxicity.

19. Is the substance: open chain (GY?
Questions. 19-21 deal with open-chain substances.

20..Is the structure a linear or simply branched (1): aliphatic (A)
compound containing any. one or combination of only the follow-
ing functional groups (E): (a) four or less, each, of alcohol, alde-
hyde, carboxylic:acidi or esters and/or (b) one.each of one or more
ofthe following: acetal, either ketone or ketal] but not both, mer-
captan, sulphide (mono- or poly-), thioester, polyoxyethylene
[((—OCH,CH,—),. with x no greater than 4], or primary. or ter-
tiary. amine?
This question should be answered ‘yes’ ifi the. structure contains
one or any. possible combination of alcoholic, aldehydic or carboxy-
lic acid or ester groups, provided there are no more than four of
any one. kind. It should be answered ‘yes’ if the. structure contains
in: addition to, or instead of, those justi listed, any assortment of
no. more than: one each of the following: acetal, either ketone or
ketal buti noti both, mercaptan, mono- or polysulphide, thioester,
polyoxyethylene, primary. or tertiary amine. Answer the. question
‘no’ if the: structure contains more than four of any. of the firsti
seti of groups, more than one of the second set, or any substituent
not listed.

21. Does the. structure contain three or more differenti types of

functional groups (exclude methoxy and consider acids and esters

as one functional type)?
Aliphatic (A): compounds containing three. or more different func-
tional groups (excluding methoxy) are too: complex to permit satis-
factory prediction: of toxicity: They should’ go, therefore, into class
II]. However, we do. not wish to put into: class III polyesters and
similar substances, so. these and the methoxy compounds get passed
along to question 18.

22:.Is the substance a common component of food (C) or structur-
ally closely. related (K):to a common component of food (C)?
This question places in: class II the natural, nature-identical and
nearly nature-identical substances not alfeady put into: class I by.
physiologicalloccurrence or structural criteria. An artificial (i-e..non-
nature-identical): substance, or one not closely related, goes to
question 33.

23, Is the substance aromatic (B)?

Questions 23-26 deal with alicylic: substances.

24. Is the substance. monocarbocyclic (excluding. cyclopropane
or cyclobutane and: their derivatives) with ring or aliphatic (A)
side chains, unsubstituted or containing only alcohol, aldehyde,
side-chain ketone, acid, ester, or sodium, potassium or calcium
sulphonate or sulphamate, or acyclic acetal or ketal?
