components. Part (b) allaws compounds with permitted functional
groups but longer side chains into class II instead of sending them
eventually, into class HI..Part.(c) puts short-chain polyoxyethylene
derivatives of aryl! compounds into class II rather than: class IH.

33. Does. the substance bear on every major structural com-
ponent at least one sodium, potassium, or calcium sulphonate
or sulphamate for every 20 or fewer carbon. atoms without any
free. primary amines except those adjacent to the. sulphonate or
sulphamate.
Sodium, potassium, and calcium sulphonate and: sulphamate salts
have a strong tendency. to decrease toxicity. by promoting. solu-
bility, and rapid excretion. This is particularly’ noticeable. for
example, with some. of the food colourings..It is important. that
the substance bears. sufficient sulphonate groups, including: one
on each of the major structural fragments into which the. original
compound might be metabolizedi This. question serves to steer
sulphonated compounds except those with amines non-adjacent
to the sulphonate into a presumptively less. toxic: classification
than the compounds would occupy ifi unsulphonated.
