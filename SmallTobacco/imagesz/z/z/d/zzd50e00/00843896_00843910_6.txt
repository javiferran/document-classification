25. Is the substance (a)ia cyclopropane or cyclobutane. with only
the substituents mentioned in question 24 or (b) a mono- or
bicyclic sulphide.or mercaptan?

26. Does the structure contain no functional groups other than
those listed in question 24 and is it either a monocyloalkanone
or a bicyclic compound with or without a ring ketone?’

27. Does (do) the ring(s)} have any, substituents?
Questions 27-31 deal with aromatic compounds.

28.. Does the structure contain:more than one aromatic (B) ring?

29. Is it. readily: hydrolysed: (H) to: mononuclear. residues? (If yes
treat the individual! aromatic mononuclear residues. by. question
30 and any other residue by question 19.)

30. Disregarding ring hydroxy or methoxy. does the ring. bear
substituents other than 1-—5-carbon: aliphatic (A) groups, either
hydrocarbon or containing alcoliol;. ketone, aldehyde, carboxyl!
or simple esters. that may. be hydrolysed to ring substituents of
five or less carbons? (If a simple ester that may be hydrolysed)
treat the aromatic portion by question 18 and the residue by
question 19.):
This shouldi be answered ‘no’ ifi the ring. bears only: aliphatic
groups of five carbons or less, which are either hydrocarbon in:
nature or contain the groups. listed! If the ring bears: any. other
substituents than those listed, the question: should be answered
‘yes’ and one should proceed to. question: 31.

31. Is the substance. an acyclic acetal, -ketal or -ester of any
of the above substances. (see question: 30)? (If yes, assume: hy-
drolysis and treat the non-aromatic residues by question 19 and.
the aromatic residue by. question 18:)
This: question is: simply designed to see whether the substance
would fit within, the definition ofi question 30 if it) were not an
acetal, a ketal or an ester. In other words, would the substance
carry only the groups listed. in question 30.

32. Does the. substance contain. only the functional: groups. (E)
listed! in question 30, or their derivatives listed. in question 31,
but with any or all ofithe following; (a) a single fused non-aroma-
tic carbocyclic ring, (b) aliphatic (A) substituent chains longer than:
five carbon atoms, or (c).a polyoxyethylene: ((—OCH,CH,—),
with x no greater than 4] chain either on the aromatic ring or
on an aliphatic (A) side chain?

Part (a) is intended to allow. simple derivatives of tetralin. into

class II while putting: polycyclic compounds: such as the steroids

ultimately into class HI except those that may be normal food
