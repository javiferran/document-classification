S. Is.it a. simply branched (I) acyclic aliphatic (A) hydrocarbon
or a common carbohydrate?
This drops out the generally innocuous hydrocarbons and carbo-
hydrates.

6. Is the substance a benzene derivative bearing substituents con-

sisting. only of (a) hydrocarbon chains or 1'-hydroxy or hydroxy.

ester-substituted hydrocarbon chains and (b) one.or more alkoxy
groups, one of which must be para to the hydrocarbon chain
in (a)?'

This places‘in class III safrolé. myristicin and related substances,

See

7, Is the substance Heterocyclic? O16} 8 o P~cn2

8. Is it a lactone or cyclic diester?’
This question separates the lactones and cyclic diesters from other
heterocyclic compounds.

9. Is it a lactone fused to another ring, on a five- or six-membered
a,B-unsaturated lactone?

This places certain lactones known or suspected to be of unusual
toxicity: in class TIL

*if it is a lactone, from this point. on treat the. structure as if
it. were the hydroxy acid in the form of its more stable. tautomer
and proceed to question 20 if it is open chain, to 10 if it is
heterocyclic and to. 23 if it is carbocyclic; if it is a cyclic diester
treat as the separate components.

10. Is it a 3-membered heterocycle?

This places such substances as the epoxides and ethylenimine in
class ITI.

11. Disregarding only: the. heteroatoms in any one ring, does
that heterocyclic ring contain or bear substituents other than
simply. branched (1). hydrocarbons (including bridged chains and
monocyclic aryl! or alkyl structures), alkyl alcohols, aldehydes,
acetals, ketones, ketals, acids, esters (including cyclic esters other
than lactones), mercaptans, sulphides, methyl ethers, hydroxy. or
single rings (hetero. or aryl) with no substituents other than: those
just listed?
Questions | 1-15 separate out various categories of heteroaromatic
substances. Under 11, set aside:and do not consider the atom(s),
usually oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur, making the ring heterocyclic.
If there is more than one hetero ring, regard each ring separately,
with the remainder of the structure as substituents of that hetero
ting. Other than the heterocyclic atom(s), does:the ring carry any-
thing besides the simple groups listed? If so, the answer is. ‘yes’
