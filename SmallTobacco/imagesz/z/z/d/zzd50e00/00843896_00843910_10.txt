just listed?
Questions 11-15 separate out various categories of heteroaromatic
substances: Under 11, set aside and do not consider the atom(s),
usually oxygen, nitrogen'or sulphur, making the ring heterocyclic.
If there is more than one hetero ring, regard each ring separately,
with the remainder of the structure. as substituents of that hetero
ring. Other than the heterocyclic atom(s), does the ring carry. any-
thing besides the simple groups listed? If so, the answer is ‘yes’
