components: Part (b) allows compounds with permitted functional
groups but longer side chains into class II instead of sending them
eventually. into class III. Part (c) puts short-chain polyoxyethylene
derivatives of aryl compounds into class H rather thaniclass TT.

33. Does the substance bear on every major structural com-
ponent at least one sodium, potassium, or calcium sulphonate
or sulphamate for every. 20 or fewer carbon atoms without any
free primary amines except those adjacent to the. sulphonate or
sulphamate.
Sodium, potassium, and calbium sulphonate and sulphamate salts
have a strong tendency to. decrease toxicity by promoting solu-
bility, and rapid excretion. This is particularly noticeable, for
example, with some ofithe food colourings. It is important that
the substance bears sufficient sulphonate groups, including one
on each of the major structural! fragments into: which the original
compound might. be metabolized. This question serves to steer
sulphonated compounds except those with amines non-adjacent
to the sulphonate into a presumptively: less toxic classification
than the compounds would occupy if unsulphonated..
