25. Is the substance (a):a cyclopropane or cyclobutane with: only
the substituents mentioned in question 24! or (b) a mono- or
bicyclic sulphide or mercaptan?'

26. Does the structure contain no functional! groups other than
those listed in question 24 and is it either a monocyloalkanone
or a bicyclic compound with or without a ring. Ketone?

27. Does (do) the ring(s): have any. substituents?
Questions 27-31 deal with aromatic compounds.

28. Does the structure contain more than one aromatic (B) ring?

29. Is it readily hydrolysed’ (H):to mononuclear residues? (If yes.
treat the individual aromatic mononuclear residues by question:
30 and any other residue by question 19.)

30.. Disregarding ring hydroxy or methoxy. does the ring. bear
substituents other than 1-5-carbon aliphatic (A) groups.. either
hydrocarbon or containing alcohol, ketone, aldehyde, carboxyl
or simple esters that. may: be hydrolysed. to: ring substituents of
five or less. carbons? (If a simple ester that. may be hydrolysed,
treat the. aromatic portion by question: 18. and the residue by
question 19.)
This should be answered: ‘no’ if the. ring bears only aliphatic
groups: of five carbons or less, which are either hydrocarbon in
nature or contain the groups listed. If the ring bears any: other
substituents: than those listed, the question should be answered
‘yes’ and one shouldi proceed to: question 31.

31. Is the substance an acyclic acetal, -ketal or -ester of any
of the. above substances (see. question 30)? (If yes, assume Hy-
drolysis.and treat the non-aromatic residues: by. question 19 and:
the aromatic residue by question. 18.):
This question: is simply. designed to see: whether the substance
would fit within the definition of question: 30. if it. were not: an
acetal, a ketal or an ester. in other words, would: the substance
carry only the groups listed in question 30.

32:, Does the substance contain only: the functional groups (E)
listed in question 30, or their derivatives listed' in question 31,
but with any-or all of the following: (a).a single fused non-aroma-
tic carbocyclic ring, (b) aliphatic (A) substituent chains: longer than
five carbon atoms, or (c) a polyoxyethylene [(—OCH,CH,—),
with x no. greater than 4) chain either on the aromatic ring or
on an aliphatic (A) side chain?

Part (a)! is intended to. allow simple derivatives of tetralin into

class I] while putting polycyclic compounds such as. the steroids

ultimately into: class III] except those. that may. be normal food
