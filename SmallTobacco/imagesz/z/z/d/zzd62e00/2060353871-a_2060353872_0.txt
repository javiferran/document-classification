This report updates Virginia Slims Ultra Lights most recent performance
in the Memphis and San Francisco test markets. Several data sources
will be referenced in order to provide a thorough analysis: Factory
Shipments, ICC, Retail Audits, and SPACE. Factory shipments were
jnitiated 1/22/87 with availability at retail effective 2/27/87.

Memphis

Shipment data reflect that Virginia Slims Ultra Lights registered a 0.6
S.0.M. based on recent four week period ending 5/15/87. Share was
virtually evenly distributed with Virginia Slims Ultra Lights Regular
displaying a 0.27 share and Virginia Slims Ultra Lights Menthol
contributing 0.31 share points.

At the distributor level, the brand's 4 week rolling averages have
continually grown, currently residing at a 0.8 level (w/e 4/24) --
equivalent to shipment data at that point in time.

Retail data, reflecting a 50 store panel located in the Memphis trading
area, are positioned at the 1.5 level based on the recent four week
period ending 4/26. The Ultra Light Regular and Menthol levels were
basically equal exhibiting a respective 0.7 and 0.8 S.0.M. The Ultra
Low Tar line extension currently attains a similar share in pack outlets
(S.0.M: 1.6) compared to performance in carton outlets (S.0.M: 1.4)
based on the current four week period. While the retail share data in
this report appear to be overstated in the two test markets, these
levels are at parity with share of smoker data reported by Consumer
Research, derived from a survey during week 10 after introduction.

83% for the two week period ending 4/13 -- down -7 versus the prior two
