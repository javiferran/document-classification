PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE
Supplier Diversity Development RICHMOND, VIRGINIA
TO: Distribution DATE: November 22, 1999
FROM: E. Gregory Huelsman

SUBJECT: Supplier Diversity Development (SDD) Report - October 1999

Attached is the Philip Morris USA Supplier Diversity Development October Report
for both minority and women-owned business expenditures.

Please continue to share these results with your department management and staff.
Compare the results with the Supplier Diversity Development elements that make up
your annual goal. Now is a good time to discuss new ways to increase expenditures
with minority and women businesses into the next year. Finally, the goals for 2000
are due to me by December 15, 1999.

Thank you for your continued support of our Supplier Diversity Program.
