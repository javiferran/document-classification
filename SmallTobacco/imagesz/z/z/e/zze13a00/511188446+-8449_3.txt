analyzed and the final report written, in draft, to R.J. Reynolds for review.

The draft report will be revised, if needed, and a final report submitted to

Blood Samples

Blood will be drawn in heparinized containers, placed in ice and blood cells
removed by spinning blood in a refrigerated centrifuge. The resulting plasma
is divided into two equal aliquots (approx. 5 ml). One sample will be frozen
and stored at a temperature of not less than -20Â°C. This sample will serve
as source for replacement in the event of lost samples and confirmation of
samples showing any aberrant values. The other 5 ml sample of plasma will be
analyzed by Arthur D. Little, Inc., for cotinine levels in plasma. Cotinine
plasma levels in Monday samplings will be correlated with plasma levels ob-
tained after changing brands on day 7 or immediately before changing brands
in the cross-over. At the time blood is drawn, each subject will be asked if
he used any medication or drugs during the period since his last visit.
