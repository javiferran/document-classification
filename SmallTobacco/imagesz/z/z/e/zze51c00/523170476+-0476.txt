RE: Web Gathered Cigarette Technology DATE: August 12, 1992

As I mentioned to you earlier, I am very interested in the web
gathered cigarette technology as a means to improve cigarette
quality. ayeas of interest include the following:

 

Improved cigarette rod uniformity

Enhanced consistency .

Elimination of loose ends

Elimination of stem holes

Incorporation of additives such as calcium carbonate to
control burn rate & ash formation

o Flavor addition

However, I realize this technology is in its exploratory
stages of development and requires additional testing and
refinements before we can consider it as a replacement for cut
filler.

As an interim step, I propose that we consider combining the web
gathered cigarette technology with conventional cut filler/
cigarette~-making capabilities. If we can feed the tobacco web
into the center of the cigarette maker (Jim Pryor’s web funnel
guide) and feed the cut filler to the periphery, we may be able
to obtain some of the benefits of the web gathered cigarette
technology sooner than originally projected.

 

In essence, this approach could provide incremental improveménts
to our current products while minimizing the risks associated
with a wholesale change.

I look forward to discussing this approach with the team at the
next meeting and appreciate your interest and support.
