At Bill Moore's request, we held a meeting on September 20 to discuss
how current PM-USA volume forecasts are made and the computer
systems used to support them. As a result of that session, the three
forecasting groups -

Department Contact
Sales Planning Pat Piscitelli
Market Research Ed Gawronski
Production Planning Dan Bylsma

have submitted "wish lists" of what they would like to have to upgrade their
work.

| appreciate your willingness to meet with the authors of the attached lists
early in October and determine what is practical to develop and implement
by January 1, 1991. The sense of urgency is due to the fact that the
current approach is having a negative effect on the quality of our
production planning at a time when capacity is severely constrained.

Thank you for your assistance.
