Statistical issues related to this study are

1) Will the levels of nicotine/cotinine observed be
detectable?

2) Evaluation of exposure at different places will rely on
estimated (by questionnaire) exposure, not measured
exposure.

3) Subject occupation information should be collected if

exposures to other chemicals are to be evaluated.

4) Sample Size

The planned total sample size of 100 subjects will provide a 95%
power of detecting a difference of .75 standard deviations between
two means (at a .05 significance level), and a 70% power of
detecting a difference of .5 standard deviations between two means.
Thus, if the nicotine measurements have a standard deviation of .4,
then our statistical test will conclude that two means that differ
by .3 units are significantly different 95% of the time, and
samples from two populations whose means differ by .2 units will
yield significant test statistics 70% of the time. In fact, some
transformation (perhaps log) of the nicotine measurements may be
required to stabilize the variance for comparisons, but in any
case, the power of the test described above will apply to
differences in units of standard deviation.

To really get a thorough look at these four test factors, it would
be best to have equal numbers of subjects in each combination of
the factors (2*2*3*3=36 combinations). However, this would make
recruiting very difficult, and since two of these factors are more
important, we might relax these requirements.

We require:

1) Nearly equal sample sizes for all combinations of the
Smoking/Nonsmoking Husband and Work/Don't Work (25
subjects for each combination). We realize that all
subjects may not complete the study, resulting in unequal
sample sizes anyhow, but we would like to be balanced as
much as possible with regard to these two factors.

2) Approximately equal distributions of age group for each
of the four combinations above (approximately 8
subjects).
