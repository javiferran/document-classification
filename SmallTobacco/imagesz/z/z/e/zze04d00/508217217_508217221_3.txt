3) At least one subject of each social status group in each
of these desinated age groups. This will permit the

estimation of all interactions between any of the four
factors.

If these conditions are still too much for recruiting purposes, we
must still insist on approximate balance between combinations of
the two main factors. However, representation by at least one
subject in each of the nine combinations of age group and social
status group would be acceptable (hoping that few subjects drop
out). A data sheet is attached for keeping track of factor
combination counts with tally marks during recruiting to try to
maintain balance in the four factors.
