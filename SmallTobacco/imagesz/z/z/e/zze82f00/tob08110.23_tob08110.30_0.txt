INDUSTRY YOUTH INITIATIVES

BACKGROUND

The tobacco industry has long taken a number of affirmative steps
in response to concerns about youth smoking. However, the youth
smoking issue continues to drive legislative issues and media
coverage -- and the levels of anti-smoking charges against the
industry on this issue are increasing.

OBJECTIVE

To demonstrate to the public, legislators and decision-makers,
that the tobacco industry has and continues to support its
longstanding commitment that its preducts are not for young
people.

To reaffirm and broaden this commitment, a five-pronged effort
has been developed to counter youth smoking. The program
includes model state legislation for minimun age requirements;
model legislation for vending machine sales; a new youth industry
code; a retail sales initiative; and a new, tobacco-specific
booklet, to expand the industry's popular Responsible Living
Program.

THE INITIATIViis

1. Retail Avareness Program

The tobacco industry will work with the retailers who sell
tobacco products to reinforce adherence to both state laws
and our own conviction that smoking is for those adults who
choose tc smoke. The program is designed to assist the
retailing industry, and to enlist their support and
cooperation, in observing prohibitions against the sale of
tobacco rroducts to persons who are below the legal minimum
age. :

Distribution will be through the membership of the co-
sponsoring organizations. The program will also be
advertised in state and national retail trade publications.
The Tobacco Institute will provide promotional kits in
numbers requested by the sponsoring organizations. Decals
and other materials, noting the sponsoring organizations,
will be provided at no cost to the co-sponsoring
organization.
