PROMOTION OF YOUTH INITIATIVES

The launch date for the industry's youth initiatives has been
tentatively sct for September 12.

The launch on September 12 reflects two considerations: 1)
allowing a wetk after Congress and those states with fall
sessions to return from the Labor Day recess for advance
briefings, and 2) being almost two weeks in advance of the
Surgeon General's September 25 report so as not to relate the two
events.
