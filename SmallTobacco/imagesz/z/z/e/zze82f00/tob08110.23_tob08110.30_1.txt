2. Responsible Living Program

The tobacco industry has long held that smoking is an adult
choice, and not one for children. TI has sponsored national
advertisements voicing the industry stance against teenage
smoking, published literature on the subject, and currently
sponsors the Responsible Living Program, designed to help
parents and children cope with the difficulties of growing

up.

The program includes sponsorship of a series of

booklets written by the National Association of State Boards
of Education (NASBE) that have been turned over to The
Institute, and promotional tours by Jolly Ann Davidson, past
NASBE president.

"Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No," is the latest in the
booklet series. It is directed at parents of teenagers, and
is specifically designed to help parents talk to their
Children about the powerful influence of peer pressure to
smoke. The booklets will be promoted through a national
advertising campaign.
