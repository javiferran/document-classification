. SINCE WE TYPICALLY BUY FOR THE FUTURE IN CHAINS, IT {S
PERMISSIBLE AND RECOMMENDED TO PURCHASE UP TO AN
ADDITIONAL 2 - 3 ROWS ABOVE CALCULATED NEEDS.

1 REMEMBER THAT B&W’S ROW REQUIREMENTS ARE BASED ON
THEIR PERCENTAGE OF THAT CHAIN’S BUSINESS. IF MONTCLAIR’S
SHARE OF BUSINESS IS REMOVED FROM B&W’'S TOTAL, THEIR
ROW REQUIREMENTS ARE REDUCED PROPORTIONATELY, WHILE
B&w’s SUBSIDY PAYMENT REMAINS AT THE SAME LEVEL.
(EXCEPTION: IF B&W VOLUME DROPS TO ANOTHER LOWER
PAYMENT CATEGORY, SUBSIDY PAYMENT MAY BE REDUCED). THE
SPACE ALLOCATED TO MONTCLAIR WOULD THEN BE ATTACHED
TO LORILLARD’S CURRENT SPACE, RESULTING IN A NET INCREASE
IN SUBSIDY PAYMENTS, AS LORILLARD WOULD COMPENSATE FOR
ROWS ACHIEVED. CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE:
