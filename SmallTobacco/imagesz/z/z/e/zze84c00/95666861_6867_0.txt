cigarette brands formerly owned by the American Tobacco Company.

Prior to closure it is our challenge and responsibility to address Carton Merchandising
needs for the acquired brands.

To maintain sales volume, of acquired brands.

Although this memo will be referencing Montclair, if Malibu, Riviera, and/or Special 10’s
