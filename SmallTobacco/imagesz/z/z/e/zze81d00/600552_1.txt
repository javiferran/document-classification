We woulc. like your approval to negotiate further with the publica-
tion on the following basis: We will reinstate the contract if we
secure two back cover franchises and a first option on one more.
One back cover franchise would be July, and the second would need
to be June 1976 or earlier.

Money saved as a result of our contract cancelation has not yet
been reallocated, so there is no impact on the current KOOL and
VICEROY budgets if the contract is reinstated.

May we have your approval to proceed with this recommendation.
