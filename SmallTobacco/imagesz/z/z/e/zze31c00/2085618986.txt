RE: ‘ We Card Puerto Rico

Following our meeting 2 weeks ago, | am circulating a budget estimate
to get a We Card program launched in Puerto Rico. Some of these
numbers need review by Sandy and Denise to make sure they are
realistic for activities in Puerto Rico.

Please review this attached budget and cal me with your questions and
comments. I’ll organize a call once you’ ve had a chance to look over the
attached. T would expect our next step to be a conference call discussion
on how/when to proceed.

Regards.
