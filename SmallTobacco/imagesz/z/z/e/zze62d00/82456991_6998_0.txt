Please find attached the latest topline review of the True Carton Cash Continuity Program from
October 11th through October 22". Also find included the response analysis chart.

The number of cartons produced for this offer was 1,745,000. The original response projection
for this program was 11% and would have resulted in 16,000 coupon requests, or the submission
of 192,000 cash pieces. Response to this program continues to be very good. As of October
22nd, we had received a total of 257,016 cash pieces from consumers, resulting in 21,418 free
carton coupon requests. The response rate currently stands at 14.7%. Actual results have
exceeded the original projection by a considerable amount.

Of the requests we received, 90% derived from the True filter packings and 10% from Menthol.
Also of note, 36% of the respondents smoke 20 to 29 cigarettes per day. 27% of the respondents
smoke over 40 cigarettes a day and 17% smoke from 30 to 39. 13% did not specify.

Also find enclosed the True Carton Cash Projected Response chart. This chart shows the original
projection and the revised projection for this program and how they compare with the actual
response. You will see that the actual response through October 224 (21,418) has already

surpassed the October projection (21,215).
