Winton, in Planning 1997 programs we have been hampered by two factors:

A) What will be our split of Gratis VS Coupons (Age Verification x Non-
resiricted/Restricted States)

((Our last look prior to DB records being sent to third party sources for Age verification
netted

us around 30% of Non-restricted states - being Age Verified!))

B) How does our Best Prospects split with Competitive Emotional Core

We know we should only mail to best prospects, but have no idea how our competitive
larget

may split - potentially - a large % could be Bad bets.

I will not be able to begin to project Question B until Inbound targeting is in place
sometime in September.

But, the database was loaded with the results of third party Age verification last week, so
| pulled a small analysis to see the results against Camel target.

As the attachment shows, overall about 60% are Age Verified in Non-restricted States.
Given our smaller target Plan numbers in 1997, we could potentially only target Age
verified smokers in Non-restricted states. This would of course be the best possible offer.
We know via research and analysis that getting product in hand is key to improved
Conversion results.

In addition to potentially consider mailing only where we can send gratis, there are other
targeting strategies to consider. Another view would be to look at Camel priority Markets
x Gratis Restrictions/Age Verification. Even though Couponing is not as efficient, and
yiclds a lower overall % of Conversion, we may opt to concentrate only in strongholds
Vs national. Now I've given you food for thought for two Non-national strategics.....

We have not considered either of these strategies, or any other Non-national stratcgics
previously because of the mass quantitics of smokers we necded to put through
