Kim and Bennie,

Can you get updates from your respective colleagues and do a call with me this week or next? Next
Friday isnâ€™t good for me, and | know the week of Dec 6 is tight for everyone . [f not, I'll re-issue the
activity reports and ask for written updates.

Let me know, at which time I'll let everyone know how we will proceed.
thanks.
