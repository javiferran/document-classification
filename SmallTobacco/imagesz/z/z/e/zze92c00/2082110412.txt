The attached files are the article and accompanying editorial published today in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute
on the study suggesting that smokers are taking in more tar and nicotine than federal guidelines assume they do. Authors
of the editorial included Judith Wilkenfeld (Committee on Tobacco Product Change), Jack Henningfield, and John Slade.
The editorial states that the FTC method of testing cigarettes for tar and nicotine provides the tobacco companies an
opportunity to mislead the public. Judy
