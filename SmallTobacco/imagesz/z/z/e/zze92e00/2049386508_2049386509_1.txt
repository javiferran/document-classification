There were three Marlboro commercials. No advertiser had more
than three spots during the day.

Conclusion

There is little, if any value, advertising under the present
format. The best placement of our commercials would be immediately
after posting of the results and before the replay or immediately after
a race before the results are posted, This, however, may antagonize
the racing fan. He might feel the commercial is holding up his
wallet!

At no time was there more than 8-10 people watching a monitor (that
I observed). And during the times the commercials were aired, every-
one was buried in a"sheet."

If the format were changed to air commercials at the times mentioned
above it would be an improvement but this audience can be reached
more effectively under less intense circumstances,
