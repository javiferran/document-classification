Picture

Good on live coverage. Poor for replay - (color bleeds).
Varied for commercials, but better than replay of races, Black & white
and color often carried different feed. Tearing in many cases.

Audio

No sound on sets in areas other than Lounges and bar/dining
areas. (These areas account for less than 50% of the sets),

Commercial Placement

Extremely poor. The spots are run, as noted, under format,
after the race has been finalized in all respects and all fans are once
again buried in the Morning Telegraph or something.
