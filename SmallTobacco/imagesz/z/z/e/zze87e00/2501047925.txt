‘Plane’ Speaking
on Cabin Air Quality

The problem of indoor air quality
is one of growing concern inter-
natlonally. We spoke with Dr, Larry
Holcomb, a Michigan biologist who
specializes in toxle hazard investi
gations for government agencies and
industry, about one facet of this prob-
lem — cabin air quallty on commer-
clal airplanes, Holcomb recently
completed a comprehensive study on
cabin alr quality that was published
in Bavironmental Technology Let-
ters, a scientific journal,

Q: What are some of the com-
ponents of poor airplane cabin alr
quality and their impact?

A: A major factor is low relative
humidity, which can drop from 40 to
70 percent to 5 to 10 percent when
cold, dry alr is brought into the alr-
craft at flight altitude and heated for
circulation. This drop can result in
eye irritation and dryness of nasal
passages and the respiratory tract.

Another factor is ozone brought
into the cabin with outside alr. Ozone
has been associated with eye discom-
fort, chest pain of tightness,
breathing difficulty, nasal irritation,
persistent coughing and sore throat.
The symptoms of these two factors
often are mistakenly reported as
“allergic” reactions,

Temperature, barometric pressure
and turbulence also cause discomfort
to passengers. Even piling too much
luggage under the airplane seat can
contribute to discomfort by blocking
ventilation ports,

Q: Is the public aware of what
causes discomfort while flying?

At Most passengers are not aware
that the ale is as dry as It Is or of pose
sible ozone influences. It is very
common to blame any discomfort on
environmental tobacco smoke be-
cause {t is the only thing that you see.

This misperception has been fueled
in large part by the publicity sur-
rounding any mention of tobacco. In
fact, any of the symptoms associated
with poor cabin air quality can be
caused by low relative humidity,
ozone of the other factors f
mentioned.

Airlines, at thelr discretion, can
provide an active turnover of filtered
fresh alr. There's no evidence that
environmental tobacco smoke ad-
versely affects the health of non-
smoking passengers and crew.

Q: Will banning smoking on
commercial airlines solve the
problemn associated with poor
cabin alr quality?

At I don't think it will solve any
problems. In fact, it could even prove
disadvantageous by providing s false
sense of security to the passengers
who might believe that because they
aren't secing smoke, they are better
off, when actually they are not,

Q: What can be done to im-
prove cabin alr quality?

As If good ventilation and suffi-
clent alr changes are provided, then
ventilation should be sufficient.
Also, alreraft should be equipped
with catalytic converters to remove
ozone; those thet are already
equipped should be properly main-
tained. Some aircraft manufacturers
are beginning to bulld aircraft that re-
circulate alr. This is more likely to
cause a buildup of contaminants.

Focusing on these very real causes
of poor cabin alr quailty will go a
long way toward correcting the
problem. tit
