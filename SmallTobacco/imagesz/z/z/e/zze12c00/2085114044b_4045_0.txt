Hi Amy-

I'm fine w/ your proposed changes and would very much appreciate it if you could load all changes associated w/o the
$250 Reward.

Also, on the version w/ the $250 Reward is there a way to remove the line but still draw attention to the words "$250
Reward"? W/ the line under the words "$250 Reward" , the words "FOR MORE INFO...." look like a separate thought.
