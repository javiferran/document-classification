PROPOSAL

Several workers have demonstrated the effects of carbon monoxide on
myocardial metabolism and coronary blood flow. However, the direct effect of
carbon monoxide on the contractility of isolated heart muscle has nob been
thoroughly investigated. I propose to conduct a pilot study of this phenomena
utilizing a Blink's isolated heart muscle apparatus and a range of carbon
monoxide concentrations which will be determined experimentally. On the
basis of information obtained from this investigation, further studies would
be planned utilizing a working heart apparatus.

Right ventricles removed from laboratory rats would be isolated in a
Krebs-Ringers solution, attached to a force transducer and electrically
stimulated. After equilibration with 95% 05 - 52% C055 the preparation would
be challenged by bubbling various concentrations of CO - O5 - 5% COg through
the medium and changes in function compared to the control period noted.
Finally, 95% 09 ~ 5% CQ) would again be bubbled through the medium and
recovery of function assessed.

In addition to being recorded on the Grass recorder, the wave form of the
contraction and stimulus pulse will be displayed on and photographed by a Hewlett-
Packard Oscilliscope-camera system. In this manner the onset and decline of
developed tension, the latency period between stimulus and contraction, and the
resting tension during the pre-C0, the CO and recovery from CO periods will be
compared.

The information obtained in this functional analysis would then be used as
the basis for a more detailed study of the biochemical and electrolyte changes

produced in cardiac muscle as a result of CO exposure.
