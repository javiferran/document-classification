SUBJECT: Lamina Particle Size

We've had several questions about why we're looking for increased particle
size in stemming and there has been some work done to illustrate that larger
particle size improves filling power.

My position has been that we're looking for a cleaner product in pneumatic
separation to reduce stem particle “choke ups" in high speed machinery and
that we're reducing the smaller scrap level of particle size which gener-
ally equates to product waste in the end. From this, if we achieve a higher
filling capacity with larger particle size, that's a bonus feature.

Anyway, this discussion with our Research people in Canada produced some
good discussions. , *
