Dear Mr. Oldaker,

Tread your recent letter to Dave Tott telling of your past association with
Art Yorozu. You also described your analytical model predicting levels
of contaminates in B727 aircraft cabins, and requested detailed
information on the B727 ventilation, air velocities and leakage rates.

We appreciate your need to improve the accuracy of your analytical model
by obtaining the described detailed information. Unfortunately, the
limited amount of information that we may be able to provide you would
be of little use. All information on air velocities, ventilation rates and

_ leakage rates for the B727 is for new production aircraft. These values
could change significantly as a function of interior configuration, aircraft
service life and maintenance history. The test data you mentioned,
obtained from measurements within aircraft cabins, is most likely your
best source of information today.

I'm sorry we cannot meet your needs. Please feel free to contact me at
. (206) 234-9973 if we can be of further service.

! Sincerely,

ENGINEERING DIVISION
' MECHANICAL/ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS
