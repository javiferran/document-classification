The “No Bull” campaign appears to have slowed the decline on the brand.

Sales continue to decline due to the growth of Newport and the
promotions on Kool.

The Box and Box Light sales continue to gain new trial. Camel Menthol
has excellent distribution but trial and repeat sales have been only fair.
Kamel Red Sales have been poor and distribution is being lost.

The franchise continues to advance throughout the area. Doral Menthol
continues to be Newport's biggest competitor in highly developed menthol
calls.

Still only available in the Atlanta area. Sales and Distribution are very
limited.

This franchise continues to grow. The Ultra Light introduction has been
very successful. However, most retailers indicate the trial is coming from
the Light packings. The promotional support which has been evident
since the introduction is presently being removed. Menthol sales are
driven by the Mifes Program. Direct Accounts in Region 3 report that
Marlboro Menthol 100's will be introduced in the second quarter.

Sales remain flat. Region 5 and 17 report menthol sales increases in the
highly developed Menthol areas.

A loyal consumer base maintains the sales volume. Promotional support
seems to be a defensive measure.
