Old Gold -

Style -

and Gas Station's as well as Cigarette Stores and Tax Differential outlets.
Package sales are still growing in Urban Special Emphasis Calls. The
Menthol packings are now becoming firmly established, and the 100 MM
packings are becoming the best sellers overall. We continue to enjoy an
average 10Â¢ price advantage in most retail outlets vs. Doral and GPC.

The Box packings continue to grow throughout the area. In many cases
Newport Box Parent outsells Newport Soft. Newport Light Box 80's
continue to experience excellent increases in sales and distribution. Most
retailers are maintaining larger inventories which aids in excellent
increased competitive trial. The Light Box 100's are also benefiting from
renewed trial.

Each of these brand families continue to decline in sales with the
exception of the Kent Heavy-Up in Region 17. This program allows Kent
to maintain sales.

Sales in Region 25 have decreased dramatically due to the elimination of
promotional support. Retailers report there are some brand loyal
consumers who are continuing to purchase the brand without a coupon.

Clean-Up Program achieved our objectives, and the buy-down in the
volume accounts moved the remaining inventory through in a timely
manner.
