Sales continue to decline despite heavy promotional support, the new "B
Kool" advertising and the new Waterfall package.

Continuous and aggressive discounting has a positive impact on sales.
Coupon support has been sporadic which has resulted in sales being flat.

Sales remain steady due to loyal customer base.

No significant changes in activity. Sales continue to decline on all brands.

Sales are on the decline since the brand is given limited promotional
support. Distribution is weak in independent accounts.

Only evident in Region 17. The brand which has been basically in
Southern Florida is now expanding somewhat to Central Florida. Brand is
usually the cheapest in the stores where located. -
