Theoretically, this technique is expected to result in slightly high values
for calcium. Considering this fact along with the fact that very reproducible
results by the column elution-flame photometric procedure have been yielding
2.78% calcium, it appears that we have the most reliable proof, to date, of
the accuracy afforded in the elution method of sample preparation.

C. QUALITY INDEX FOR TOBACCO

Work is in progress to improve the reproducibility of the Kjeldahl
method for the determination of nitrogen in cigarette smoke. Although only
a limited amount of work has been done on this project, the tests indicate
the necessity of a longer digestion time.

D. MISCELLANEOUS STUDIES

I. Analysis of Residue on Archer Foil

During the past month, electrical measurements were made on 50 samples
of pyranol, pyranol extracts of aluminum foil and selected oil samples from
the #40 Foil Plant. Measurements of the dissipation factor and the capaci-
tance of the liquids were carried out with a type 1605-AH Impedance Comparator

and a precision capacitor, type 722-DQ, both products of the General Radio
Corporation.

The dissipation factor which may be equated to the power factor at low
values is a measure of the phase angle difference between the resultant
impedance vectors of the test solution and the precision capacitors:

 

De = X¢ = tan @, where Dg is the dissipation factor, X¢ the capacitive
R « .

reactance component of the solution, R the resistance of the solution, @

the resulting impedance vector, and @ the phase angle.

High values for Dg would tend to indicate that the solution in question
would not be satisfactory for capacitors, i.e., the power loss would be too
great.
