A. ANALYSIS OF TOBACCO SMOKE

I. Determination of Polycyclic Hydrocarbons by Phosphorimetry

Cigarettes containing the additives listed in Table I, along with a
control, were smoked on the analytical smoking machine. The smoke conden-
sates obtained were analyzed phosphorimetrically for fluoranthene, benzo[b]-
fluoranthene and 3,4-benzpyrene. The values obtained are also listed in
this table.

B. DEVELOPMENT OF ANALYTICAL METHODS

I. Determination of Acids in Nonaqueous Solvents

Additional perchlorates were assayed by the following procedure:
Approximately 0.5 g. of. sample was weighed into a 100-ml. volumetric
flask and dissolved in 10 ml. of water. This solution was diluted to
the mark with pyridine and 10 ml. aliquots were titrated potentio-
metrically with 0.1 N tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (Bu,NOH).

The perchlorates of copper, cobalt, aluminum, zinc, manganese,
lead and strontium were successfully analyzed in this manner. Acetic
acid must be added to the aliquot prior to the titration of chromium
