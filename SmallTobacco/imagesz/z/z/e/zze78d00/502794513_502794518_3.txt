The dissipation factors for new rolling oils were compared with the
same oils after being used. With the present care that is being taken at
the mills, no appreciable power loss has been observed in the oils. To
one sample of a rolling oi] was added approximately one part in six of a
bearing lubricant. The electrical quality of the oil was actually improved
in this case. Pyranol extracts of the foil tested also showed a decrease
in the power factor compared with that of the pyranol alone.

These measurements, of the electrical qualities of foil and rolling
oils, are being made by research personnel at the present time. However,
a technician from Archer has been trained to make these determinations and
has been familiarized with the operation of the instrument. There is no
reason why the apparatus cannot be transferred to the Archer laboratory 50
that the foil lab can proceed with this study.

A final report, covering all phases of this work, is in progress and
should be ready to submit for approval in the very near future.

Phthalimide, cyanoacetamide â€˜and o-nitroaniline are the only compounds
listed in this table which were recrystallized before analysis. This
probably accounts for the results not agreeing well with the theoretical
values for some of the others, It is also thought that recrystallization
of cyanoacetamide failed to sufficiently purify this compound.

In addition to the compounds listed in the above table four more pure
