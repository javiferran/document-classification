SAPONIFICATION RATE OF SCLAREOLIDE

Saponification Equivalent

Time ‘Theory Found % Saponified
15 minutes 250.37 590.9 42.4 .
1 hour 318.7 78.6
2 hours 278.8. 89.8
3 hours ; 266.4 94.0

Efforts were made to shorten the reaction period and still obtain
quantitative hydrolysis of the sclareolide. By using the same proportion
of reagents and increasing the reaction temperature to 55° C., 97.5 percent
of the sclareolide was hydrolyzed in one hour. However, 4 percent of the
acetoxy acid also hydrolyzed in this period. Varying the concentration
and proportion of the reagents will be tried next.

If sclareolide cannot be hydrolyzed selectively, much useful infor-
mation can still be gained by determination of total acidity by direct
titration of sclareolide-acetoxy acid mixtures, followed by determination
of the total saponification equivalent of the mixture.
