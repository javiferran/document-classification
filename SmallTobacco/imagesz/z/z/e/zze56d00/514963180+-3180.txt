TO ALL FIELD SALES PERSONNEL

SUBJECT: Petition Against Tobacco Regulation

In October, we sent you petition packs to combat a very serious threat by the anti-tobacco
forces to encourage the food and drug administration (FDA) to place severe regulations on
cigarettes. The petitions were to be placed at selected retail locations.

Thus far, the responses have been minimal and we encourage you to follow-up with retailers to

retum completed petitions as soon as possible. The deadline for petition returns has been
extended to December 31, 1994.

 

The threat against our industry is very real. The power shift in Congress in no way diminishes
this threat. Our goal is to demonstrate, by the petitions we receive, that smokers and the
general public are against any further regulations on tobacco.

Please do what you can to have the petitions mailed in by December 31, 1994.
