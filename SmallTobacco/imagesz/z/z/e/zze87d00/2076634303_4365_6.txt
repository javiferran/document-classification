MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental Design

Female rats were whole-body exposed to RASS at concentrations of 6 and 12 wg TPM/l
(WB6 and WB12) or to filtered, conditioned fresh air (WBO, sham-exposed group) for 12 h per
day, 5 days per week, for 12 months. For the comparison of exposure modes, another group
of rats was head-only exposed for 5 days per week for 12 months to the high RASS
concentration (HO12), but only for 7 h per day, which is considered the maximum daily
exposure duration for this exposure mode. Due to laboratory capacity restraints, the inclusion
of a head-only sham-exposed control group was not possible. The two exposure modes were
compared based on the TPM concentration as well as on the daily TPM dose for those end
points presumably unaffected by tube restraint. Interim investigations of pulmonary
inflammation and oxidative DNA damage, end points not previously included in subchronic SS

inhalation studies, were performed after 6 months of inhalation for WBO and WB12 only.

The study was performed in conformity with the American Association for Laboratory

Animal Science Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (1991).
Experimental Animals

Female outbred Wistar rats (Cri: (WI\WU BR), bred under specified pathogen-free
conditions, were obtained from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). Wistar rats were used in
the present study because of their potential suitability for long-term inhalation bioassays in
terms of longevity, moderate body weight development, low rate of spontaneous tumors,
particularly in the lungs, and sensitivity to rat respiratory tract carcinogens (Woutersen et al.,

1986; Kroes et al, 1988, Gupta et al., 1990; Vandenberghe, 1990; Bomhard and Rinke, 1994;
