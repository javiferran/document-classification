exposed groups, custom-made metabolism cages were used. All samples per rat and time
point were combined, centrifuged, and stored frozen. The nicotine metabolites were
determined by HPLC after derivatization with 1,3-diethyl-2-thiobarbituric acid (Rustemeier et

al., 1993, with some modifications).

Gross Pathology and Organ Weighi

Necropsy was performed without prior fasting. On the day following the last exposure at
the end of the 12-month inhalation period, 8 rats/group were killed and examined as
previously described (Haussmann et al., in press). The weights of the lungs with larynx and

trachea, liver, heart, adrenal glands, and kidneys were determined.

Histopathology

Histopathology cof the respiratory tract was performed as previously described
(Haussmann et al., in press). Processing and sectioning of the samples was performed at
Huntington Research Centre (Huntington, U.K.). In the larynx, only the base of epiglottis could
be fully examined due to sectioning problems. All slides were read by a veterinary pathologist
in a blinded manner with experience in cigarette smoke-related changes in the respiratory
tract of rodents. All pathological findings were scored according to a defined severity scale

from 0 to 5 (marked effects). Mean severity scores were calculated based on all rats of a

group. _.

Composition of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Cells

As a measure for possible inflammatory processes in the lungs, a differential count of
bronchoalveolar lavage cells was performed using flow cytometry. For this purpose, 8

rats/group were killed as described following 6 (WBO and WB12 only) and 12 months (all
