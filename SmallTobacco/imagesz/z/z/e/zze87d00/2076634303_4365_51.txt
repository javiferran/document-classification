FIGURE LEGENDS

Figure 1 Biomonitoring of RASS exposure: A: Blood carboxyhemoglobin determined at
three time points (means + SE), B: Hemoglobin adduct of 4-aminobipheny! after 12 months of

RASS inhalation (means + SE).

Figure 2. Biomonitoring nicotine uptake: A: sum of 5 nicotine metabolites excreted in
24-h urine in month 5 of the inhalation period (means + SE), B: Data from A, normalized to
the inhaled nicotine dose (based on the nicotine concentration in the test atmospheres, the

respiratory minute volume calculated according to Guyton (1947), and the body weight of the

rats; means + SE).
Figure 3 Body weight development (means).

Figure 4 Alveolar macrophage fluorescence (means + SE; *: statistically significantly

different from WBO).

Figure 5 Tissue levels of 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine: A: nasal respiratory epithelium, B:

nasal olfactory epithelium, C: lungs

Figure 6 Urinary excretion of 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (means + SE; *: statistically

significantly different from WBO).

Figure 7 Comparison of RASS in present study with ETS either generated at an extreme
concentration under experimental conditions (Martin et al., 1997) or as determined in a large

field study (Jenkins et al., 1996).
