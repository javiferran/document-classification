Statistical Analysis

The following statistical tests were performed on the biological data: For the overall
comparison of the whole-body RASS- and sham-exposed graups (WBO, WB6, and WB12),
the one-way analysis of variance for continuous data (Sachs, 1982) and the generalized
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (Koch and Edwards, 1988) for ordinal data were used with the
TPM concentration as the stratifying variable. If the overall comparison showed a significant
difference, the Duncan test (Duncan, 1955) and the generalized Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel
test were applied to continuous and ordinal data, respectively, for a pairwise comparison
between the groups. All tests were conducted at the nominal level of significance of a = 0.05
(2-tailed). Due to the large number of parameters analyzed, no correction for multiple testing
was applied, which would have made the tests very insensitive. Statistical significances,

therefore, have to be considered as explorative indicators rather than confirmatory evidence.
