using an aerosol such as cigarette smoke, this exposure mode might be subject to
confounding influences, such as oral uptake during grooming. Differences between the head-
only and whole-body exposure modes were reported for effects observed following subchronic
MS inhalation (Mauderly et al., 1989). In the present study, therefore, the head-only exposure
mode was compared to the whole-body mode with regard to various biomarkers of exposure
and effect. The test substance uptake was maximized by extending the daily exposure

duration as long as feasible for each exposure mode.
