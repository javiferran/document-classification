HO12 / WB6). This contrasts with gaseous irritants, such as formaldehyde, which induced
epithelial hyperplasia and metaplasia in the anterior part of the nose depending on the

concentration rather than on the daily inhaled dose (Wilmer et al., 1989).

The base of epiglottis was the most sensitive site of the respiratory tract in this and the
subchronic study (Haussmann et al., in press). The hyperplastic and metaplastic changes
seen there were not seen in SS inhalation studies performed by other laboratories (von

Meyerinck et al., 1989; Coggins et al., 1993).

The only relevant histopathological finding in the lower respiratory tract following chronic
RASS inhalation was slight reserve cell hyperplasia in the bronchial respiratory epithelium,
which was not seen in the subchronic SS inhalation studies (von Meyerinck et al., 1989;
Coggins et al., 1993; Teredesai and Priins, 1994; Haussmann et al., in press). It remains to
be investigated whether this effect is due to the chronic inhalation period or the higher
concentration or dose in the present study compared to the previous ones. Morphometric
analyses to assess the pulmonary changes reported by Escolar et al. (1995) were not

performed in the present study.

The composition of the bronchoalveolar lavage cells did not indicate an inflammatory
response to chronic RASS inhalation, although there was a slight but statistically insignificant
increase in the number of AM, a response similar to that seen in rats following MS inhalation
(Gairola, 1986; Bjermer et al., 1993; Miller et al., 1996). Also for MS, Mauderly et al. (1989)
reported an increase in the concentration of PMNL in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of rats,
whereas no statistically significant responses were found by others for this species (Gatrola,
1986; Bjermer et al., 1993; Miller et al., 1996). Mice were considered to be more sensitive to

MS inhalation with regard to PMNL responses (Gairola, 1986). However, no histopathological
