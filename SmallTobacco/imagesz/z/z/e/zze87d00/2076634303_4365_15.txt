8-Hydroxy-Deoxyguanosine Determination

As a measure for possible oxidative DNA damage, 8-OHdG was determined in 8
rats/group after 6 (WBO and WB12 only) and 12 months (all groups) of inhalation. During the
last exposure day, rats were killed as described. The lungs were perfused in situ with isotonic
saline to remove erythrocytes. The lungs as well as the nasal respiratory epithelium and the
nasal olfactory epithelium were stored frozen at -70°C until further processing. DNA
extraction was performed according to Gupta (1984) with emphasis on fast tissue processing
to prevent both DNA repair and artificial DNA oxidation. Enzymatic digestion of DNA as well
as chromatographic separation (Nucleosil 100-5 C18 precolumn, CS Chromatographie
Service, Langerwehe, Germany; Novapack C18, Waters Millipore; HPLC HP 1050, Hewlett
Packard) and electrochemical determination (HP 1049A, Hewlett Packard) of 8-OHdG were
performed according to Shigenaga et al. (1990). The amount of deoxyguanosine (dG) present

in the samples was determined by its absorbance at 245 nm.

As an integrative monitor for oxidative DNA damage without specification of the organs
involved, 8-OHdG excretion in urine was determined in 5 to 6 rats/group at 5 and 12 months
of inhalation. Twenty-four hour urine samples were collected as described for nicotine
biomonitoring. The purification of 8-OHdG from the rat urine was performed according to
Shigenaga et al. (1990) with some modifications. An internal standardization method was
employed using SH+abeled 8-OHdG prepared from [1°,2’H}-dGTP (Amersham,
Braunschweig, Germany) according to Kasai and Nishimura (1984). Interfering substances in
the eluate were oxidized at +0.35 V before the actual 8-OHdG determination using an

additional electrochemical detector.
