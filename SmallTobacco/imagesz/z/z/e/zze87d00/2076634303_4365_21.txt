Histopathology

In the anterior level of the nose (level 1), patchy, slight to moderate reserve cell
hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium was observed (Table 2). This effect was
concentration dependent in the whole-body exposed rats and similar in severity and incidence
in HO12 and WB12. Slight squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium was observed
in WBt2, this effect being seen in only a few rats in WB6 and HO12. Nasal goblet cell

hyperplasia was seen in only two rats out of a total of 24 rats in the RASS-exposed groups.

The few larynges evaluated showed cistinct squamous metaplasia of the pseudostratified
epithelium and hyperplasia of the squamous epithelium at the base of epiglottis (Table 2).

These effects were pronounced and dose dependent.

At the tracheal bifurcation, slight reserve cell hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium was
observed in only a few rats (not statistically significant; Table 2). In the pulmonary bronchial
respiratory epithelium of the lungs, the severity of this finding was similar but the incidence
was higher occurring most frequently in HO12. For both WB6 and WB122, this finding was
statistically significantly different from WBO. The number of goblet cells was similar in all
groups. A slight accumulation of pigmented alveolar macrophages was seen in WB12 and

HO12.

The histopathological findings in the upper respiratory tract were less pronounced in HO12
compared to WB12. In the larynx at the base of epiglottis, the severity of the findings in HO12
was similar to that in WB6 (equal TPM doses). In the lower respiratory tract, the HO12
findings were closer to those seen in WB12, and the accumulation of pigmented alveolar

macrophages was even seen at a higher incidence in HO12 than in WB12.
