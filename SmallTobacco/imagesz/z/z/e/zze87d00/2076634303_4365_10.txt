The analytical methods used to determine TPM, CO, nicotine, nitrogen oxides, aldehydes,
ammonia, and the particle size distribution as well as those for temperature and relative
humidity in the exposure chambers were performed as previously described (Haussmann et
al., in press). The other analytes were determined as follows: 3-Ethenyl-pyridine and nicotine

were determined in parallel using 2-ethenyl-pyridine as internal standard. Solanesol was

determined in particulate matter after trapping on Fluoropore membrane filters (pore size: 1

um; Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) by reversed phase HPLC (Lichrospher RP-seleci B, 5 um,
125 x 3 mm, Merck, Darmsiadt, Germany) and UV detection (HP 1090, Hewlett Packard,
Waldbronn, Germany). Isoprene, toluene, 1,3-butadiene, and benzene were trapped in
methanol at -78Â°C and determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS;
Hewlett Packard 5890A/5970B) with a DB-5.625 column (80 m x 0.25 mm, J and W, Fisons,
Wiesbaden, Germany). Phenols were determined in the particulate phase after trapping on
Cambridge type glass fiber filters (Gelman, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), extraction, and silylation
using GC/MS with a DB-5.625 column. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons were extracted from a
TPM-loaded glass fiber filter with methanol/water followed by back extraction with hexane,
clean-up by solid phase extraction (Bakerbond amino, Baker, ?, Germany), and analyzed by
GC/MS with a DB-17 column (80 m x 0.25 mm, J and W). N-nitrosamines were trapped in
citrate/phosphate buffer with ascorbic acid and on glass fiber filters connected in series. The
combined dichloromethane extracts were washed with a sodium hydroxide solution and by
adsorption chromatography on aluminum oxide. The N-nitrosamines were determined by GC
with a DB-5 column 30 m x 0.53 mm, ICT, Bad Homburg, Germany) and a thermal energy
analyzer (TEA 502A, Thermo Electron Corporation, via Isconlab, Heidelberg, Germany). For
the determination of the metals, SS was collected on membrane filters with 0.22 um pore size

(GSWP 02500, Millipore). After the filters were digested with nitric acid, the metals were
