Biomonitoring

In order to provide an estimate of the amount of test atmosphere taken up by the rats,
respiratory frequency and tidal volume were determined on at least 10 rats/group by whole-
body plethysmography, three times during the inhalation period, as previously described
(Haussmann et al., in press). Rats were allawed to adapt to the plethysmographic tubes prior
to data acquisition. During the adaptation and acquisition periods, they were continuously

exposed to the test atmospheres.

To monitor exposure to CO, steady-state proportions of blood carboxyhemoglobin (HCO)
were determined in 5 rats/group according to Klimisch et al. (1974), three times during the
inhalation period. After at least 5 h of exposure, rats were removed from the exposure
chambers for a short period of time, and blood samples were taken under diethyl ether

narcosis by puncturing the retro-orbital sinus with glass micropipettes.

To monitor exposure to aromatic amines, hemoglobin adducts of nine aromatic amines
were determined in 7 to 8 rats/group following 12 months of RASS inhalation according to
Kutzer et al. (1997). The hydrolyzed amines were derivatized with pentafluoropropionic
anhydride (Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) and analyzed using gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry with negative chemical ionization in the SIM mode (DB-5MS column, J&W
Scientific, Folsom, CA / TSQ 700, Finnigan, Bremen, Germany). For internal standardization,

Ds-aniline (Aldrich) and Ds-2-aminobiphenyl (IC Chemikalien, Ismaning, Germany) were used.

To provide an estimate of the amount of nicotine taken up by the rats, nicotine metabolites
were determined in urine collected from 6 rats/group over 24 h, three times during the
inhalation period. During the 7-h head-only exposure period, the urine was collected using

specially modified exposure tubes. During the postexposure period and for the whole-body
