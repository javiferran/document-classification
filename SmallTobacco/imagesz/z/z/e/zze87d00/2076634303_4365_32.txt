repair activity in the leukocytes of smokers (Asami et al., 1996). However, the above results
do not preclude possible oxidative changes in particular pulmonary cell types not detectable

by analyzing the homogenate of the whole organ.

The cetermination of the urinary excretion of 8-OHdG enables an overall assessment of
oxidative DNA modifications and repair in the whole body (Shigenaga et al., 1990). A 50 %
increase of the 8-OHdG excretion was reported for smokers (Loft et al., 1992). In the present
study, a dose dependent increase of 8-OHdG excretion In the whole-body exposed rats was
seen following 5 months of RASS inhalation. After 12 months, however, this effect was no
longer seen. It is not known whether this can be explained by adaptive processes in the
course of chronic RASS inhalation. Further, a distinction between effects related to the head-
only RASS exposure and those related to the oxidative stress possibly associated with a
certain degree of immobilization (Liu et al., 1996) imposed by the head-only exposure mode is
not possible. Another point to consider is the higher catechol concentration in HO12
compared to WB1i2: Aqueous catechol solutions were capable of generating 8-OHdG in vitro
(Leanderson and Tagesson, 1990), and a combined intraperitoneal administration of catechol
and hydroquinone or phenol resulted in an increased level of 8-OHdG in mouse bone marrow

(Kolachana et al., 1993).

Using the whole-body exposure mode, the rats could be exposed for a daily duration
longer than that considered feasible for heac-only exposure, thereby maximizing the daily
RASS dose. This also enabled evaluations on the impact of the daily RASS dose vs. the
RASS concentration as demonstrated, e.g., for the histopathological changes in the larynx.
For most of the end points investigated in this study, the exposure mode per se did not
influence the RASS-induced changes, which were mainly local effects in the respiratory tract.

It did, however, impact the evaluation of the body weight gain, which was essentially the only
