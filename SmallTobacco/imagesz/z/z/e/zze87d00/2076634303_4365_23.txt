Urinary Excretion At 5 months of RASS inhalation, an increased excretion of 8-OHdG
was observed in the whole-body exposed groups with increasing RASS concentrations
(Figure 6). Such an effect was not seen at 12 months of inhalation. Again, a contribution of a

tube restraint-related effect cannot be excluded for the HO12 results.
