Heinrich et al., 1995; Sanders and Lundgren, 1995). Female rats were used, because they
showed a higher sensitivity in several long-term aerosol inhalation studies Brightwell et al.,
1989; Nikula et al., 1995), while in subchronic SS inhalation studies no difference was
reported for the histopathological changes between male and female rats (Coggins et al.,
1992). Wistar rats have not been used for the evaluation of SS-induced histopathological

changes in the respiratory tract to date.

The respiratory tracts of 5 randomly selected rats were histopathologically examined on

arrival; no abnormal findings were observed. Serological screening of 10 to 15 rats performed .

on arrival and after 6 and +2 months of inhalation did not detect antibodies to rat-related
viruses, such as hantavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, murine adenovirus, parvovirus
H-1, pneumonia virus of mice, rat coronavirus/sialodacryoadenitis virus, rat virus, reovirus 3,
rodent orphan parvovirus, Sendai virus, and Theilerâ€™s murine encephalomyelitis virus, to the
bacteria Clostridium piliforme, Mycoplasma pulmonis, and cilia-associated respiratary bacillus,

nor to the protozoon Encephalitozoon cuniculi.

The rats were individually identified using subcutaneous transponders (IMI-1000, Plexx,
Elst, Netherlands; data acquisition by DAS-4001, Uno, Zevenaar, Netherlands). Following a
7-day acclimatization period before exposure, they were randomly allocated to ihe two RASS
groups and the sham exposure group for whole body exposure (WBO and WB12: 96
rats/group; WB6: 48 rats) as well as to the high RASS concentration group for head-only
exposure (HO12: 48 rats). The age of the rats at the start of the inhalation period was

between 55 and 70 days. The body weight at that time was 110 g (SD: 10 g).

The rats were barrier maintained in an animal laboratory unit with controlled hygienic

conditions. The laboratory air (filtered, fresh air) was conditioned. Positive pressure was
