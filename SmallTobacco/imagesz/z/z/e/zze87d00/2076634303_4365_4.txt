end points has been included in this study to obtain mechanistic information on potential long-
term/tumorigenic effects of SS using this experimental design. Pulmonary inflammation was
assessed by investigating the composition of bronchoalveolar lavage cells, while oxidative
DNA damage was assessed by determining tissue and urinary 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-
OHdG) levels. Other end points, such as cytokeratin expression, an epithelial ceil
differentiation marker, were also investigated and will be reported elsewhere (cf, Schiage et

al., 1997).

Since ETS can not be reproducibly generated as required for chronic laboratory
experiments, room-aged SS (RASS) has been used as a suitable experimental surrogate for
ETS (Voncken et al., 1994; Haussmann et al., in press). Although the carbon monoxide (CO)
concentration - as a proxy for the number of cigarettes smoked per air volume - may be the
most relevant basis to evaluate experimental SS-related effects, the TPM concentration was
used in the present study to enable a comparison with environmental or other experimental
SS studies. Concentrations in the range used in the present study (6 and 12 ug TPM/) have
shown to be effective in subchronic studies on rodents in producing a spectrum of
histopathological (von Meyerinck et al. 1989), biochemical (Ji et al., 1994), genotoxic (Lee et
al., 1993), and cell proliferative changes (Witschi et al., 1995a) and were, therefore,
considered suitable for a chronic RASS inhalation study. The RASS concentrations employed
in this study were approximately 100-fold higher than the maximum of the average
concentrations of respiratory suspended particles (RSP) reported for ETS (Guerin et al.,

1992; US EPA, 1992; Jenkins et al., 1996).

The aforementioned long-term SS inhalation studies were conducted using the whole-
body exposure mode (Haley et al. 1987a and b; Witschi et al., 1995a and 1997). This is most

probably related to the convenience for both experimental animals and staff. However, when
