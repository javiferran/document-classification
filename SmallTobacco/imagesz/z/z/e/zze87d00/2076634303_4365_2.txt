there was little indication for progression or occurrence of new effects from 3 or 6 months to
72 months of RASS inhalation. There were also no signs of inflammation or oxidative DNA
modification in the lungs. Chronic head-only exposure to RASS was shown to be technically
feasible and is generally considered preferable for smoke inhalation studies over whole-body
exposure to avoid artificial changes in smoke composition and the non-inhalative uptake of

smoke constituents.
