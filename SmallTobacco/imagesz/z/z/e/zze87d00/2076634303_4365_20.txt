was calculated based on the nicotine concentrations in the test atmospheres, the exposure
durations, and the respiratory minute volume according to Guyton (1947), the nicotine uptake
in the whole-body exposed rats was still 2- to 3-fold higher than that in the head-only exposed
rats (Figure 2B). The sum of the five metabolites excreted in HO12 accounted for almost 50
% of the estimated nicotine taken up. Overall, the pattern seen for the: five nicotine
metabolites relative to each other was similar at all three time points as well as for the

different dose levels and exposure modes (data not shown).
Body Weight Development

The body weight of the rats Increased throughout the inhalation period (Figure 3). After 3,
6, 9, and 12 months of inhalation, the body weight gain was statistically significantly lower by
5 to 8 % in WB12 compared to WBO; with the exception of the 12-month time point, the body
weight gain in WB6 was statistically significantly lower by 4 to 6 % compared to WBO (SE 1 to
2 % in all cases). The pronounced body weight effect seen in HO12 is considered to be
mainly due to the exposure mode (Griffith and Standafer, 1985). A direct evaluation of the
RASS effect on body weight development under head-only conditions is not possible in the

present study due to the lack of a corresponding sham-exposed head-only control group.
Gross Pathology and Organ Weights

No RASS-related gross pathological changes were observed. The only statistically
significant change in absolute organ weights in the whole-body exposed groups was a slightly
decreased absolute heart weight in WB12 (-9 + 2%), which was no longer apparent when
normalized to the respective body weight. As for the body weights, possible organ weight
effects in HO12 could not be evaluated due to the lack of a corresponding sham-exposed

head-only control group.
