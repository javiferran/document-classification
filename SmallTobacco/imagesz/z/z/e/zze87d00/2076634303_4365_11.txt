Animal Exposure System

The whole-body exposure chambers made of glass and stainless steel were equipped
with 24 stainless steel wire mesh cages, which were mounted above stainless steel excretion
pans. Each cage had a separate supply of test atmosphere. The flow rate through the
chambers was 180 I/min. The position of the cages within the chamber was systematically
changed on a weekly basis. Rats were exposed to RASS as well as to filtered, conditioned
fresh air (sham-exposed control) for 12 h per day, 5 days per week, using two exposure

chambers per group for WBO and WB12 and 1 chamber for WB6.

Another group of rats (HO12) was head-only exposed to RASS for 7 h per day, 5 days per
week. This exposure system was described previously (Haussmann et al., in press). The

position of the rats in the chamber was systematically changed on a daily basis.
In-Life Observations

The rats were observed daily for mortality, moribundity, signs of overt toxicity, or injuries.
Detailed checks on general condition and behavior of the rats were performed on 3 rats/group
per day shortly after the end of the daily exposure throughout the first 3 months, and two
times per week in months 4 to 6. Starting with month 7, tumor checks were performed two
times per week on ail rats. The body weight of the individual rats was determined one day
after their arrival, at the start of the inhalation period, and once per week during the inhalation

period.
