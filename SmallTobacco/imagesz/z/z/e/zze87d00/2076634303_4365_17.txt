RESULTS
RASS Composition

Throughout the 12-month inhalation period, RASS was reproducibly generated and
delivered to both types of exposure chambers. The analytical characterization of the sham
and RASS exposure groups is shown in Table 1. As targeted, the TPM concentrations
determined in the high concentration groups were the same for both exposure modes. The
concentrations of most of the particulate phase constituents paralleled the TPM
concentrations in the various groups. However, the catechol concentration in HO12 was
almost twice as high as in WB12, for which there is no explanation. The dilution of the RASS
entering the head-only chamber, necessary to achieve equal TPM concentrations in WB12
and HO12, was reflected by the lower CO concentration in HO12 and, although not as
distinct, also in the concentrations of most of the other gas phase compounds with two
exceptions: The nicotine and formaldehyde concentrations were 30 and 70 % lower,
respectively, in WB12 than expected based on the HO12 data if a proportional dilution of all
RASS components is assumed. The carbon dioxide concentration was determined both at the
inlet and outlet of the exposure chambers to assess its concentration in RASS as well as the

concentration added by the exhalate of the rats, respectively.

The particle size distribution was the same for all RASS exposure groups regardless of
the exposure mode, with an average median mass aerodynamic diameter of 0.42 um anda

geometrical standard deviation of 1.8.

The relative humidity in the sham-exposed group was 58 + 8 % (mean + SD); this is

considered to be representative for the other exposure groups. The temperature within the
