Composition of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Cells

There was a slight but statistically insignificant increase in the number of alveolar
macrophages and thus of the total number of bronchoalveolar lavage cells with increasing
TPM concentrations after 12 months of RASS inhalation (Table 3). No effect was seen for the
number of lymphocytes and PMNL. Thus, no sign of a RASS-related inflammatory effect was
observed. The same holds true for the comparison of WB12 and WBO following 6 months of

RASS inhalation (data not shown).

A green fluorescence was observed in the alveolar macrophages, the intensity of which
increased with the RASS concentration (Figure 4). For WB12, the intensity was similar
following 6 or 12 months of RASS inhalation indicating that a saturation or a steady-state

equilibrium was already obtained after the shorter inhalation period.
8-Hydroxy-Deoxyguanosine Formation

Tissue Content Both after 6 and 12 months of RASS inhalation, the nasal 8-OHdG
content increased in WBi2 compared to WBO (Figure 5A and B); this increase was
statistically significant in two out of four cases. The most pronounced effect was seen in the
respiratory epithelium after 12 months of inhalation (+158 %). Overall, a steady-state
equilibrium between formation and repair of this modification seemed to be reached already
by the 6-month time point. The results for the head-only exposed group are difficult to

interpret, because a tube restraint-related effect cannot be excluded.

In the lungs, a consistent but statistically insignificant decrease of the 8-OHdG content by
approximately 30 % was observed at both time points regardless of the exposure mode

(Figure 50).
