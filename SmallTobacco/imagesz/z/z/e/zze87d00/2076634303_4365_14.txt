groups) of RASS inhalation. The lungs were lavaged via the trachea with 120 mi lavage
medium per rat in 10 lavage cycles. The lavage medium was Dulbeccoâ€™s phosphate buffered
saline (pH 7.3) without calcium and magnesium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) supplemented
with 3.25 g/l bovine serum albumin (Sigma}. The viability of the lavaged cells of all groups
was 95.5 % (SE: 0.4%) as determined by the Trypan blue dye exclusion method. After
fixation of the cells, they were incubated on ice for 48 h in a cell membrane permeabilization
medium (according to Sander et al., 1991, with some modifications) to enable labeling of an
intracellular epitope with the pan rat macrophage antibody ED1-fluoresceinisothiocyanate
(FITC) conjugate (15 mg/l; Serotec, Kidlington, UK). Propidium iodide was added as a nucleic
acid marker at 5 mg/l. The cells were analyzed using a Cytofluorograf 50H flow cytometer
(Ortho Diagnostic Systems, Westwood, MA) in conjunction with the Cicero data acquisition
and analysis workstation (Cytomation, Ft. Collins, CO). The cell populations (alveolar
macrophages (AM), lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL)) were identified
by their characteristic appearance on a dot plot histogram of green (ED1-FITC; 515 - 530 nm)
vs, red (nucleic acid content; > 630 nm) fluorescence. From each sample, 30,000 counts were
collected. Microscopic evaluation of Pappenheim-stained (Romeis, 1968) smears of

bronchoalveolar lavage cells confirmed the flow cytometric results.

An aliquot of the above fixed lavaged cells was analyzed for spontaneous fluorescence.
The system was internally calibrated by adding monodisperse (diameter: 1.95 um) fluorescent
latex beads (Duke Scientific, Palo Alto, CA) into the cell suspension. After gating the AM
population from a dot plot histogram of axial light loss vs. right angle light scatter, the green
fluorescence (515 - 530 nm) was quantified in arbitrary units normalized to that of the

admixed latex beads. From each sample, 15,000 counts were collected.
