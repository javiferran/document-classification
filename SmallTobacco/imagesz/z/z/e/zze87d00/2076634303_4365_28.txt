Lee et al., 1993; Teredesai and Priihs, 1994; Haussmann et al., in press). It remains to be
investigated whether this pigmentation is due to the higher daily particulate matter dose in the
chronic compared to the subchronic studies or whether this is related to the chronic inhalation
period. AM pigmentation was not seen in the chronic SS/MS inhalation study on A/J mice at
87 ug TPM/I (Witschi et al., 1997). The discrepancy between the results of these two chronic
inhalation studies remains to be resolved in view of a possible use of AM pigmentation as a
pulmonary particulate biomonitor. To date, this discrepancy speaks for a species-specific

secondary source for the pigmentation rather than for a simple endocytosis of TPM.

A dose-dependent increase in the fluorescence of AM from bronchoalveolar lavage was
seen in the present study. This fluorescence has not been described in SS inhalation studies
to date. Increased AM fluorescence was reported for MS-exposed rats (Coggins et al., 1980;
Skdld et al., 1993) as well as for smokers compared to nonsmokers (Vassar et al., 1960;
Sk√©ld et al., 1989). There was no progression of this effect between 6 and 12 months of
RASS inhalation, suggesting either a saturation of the effect as discussed for the AM
fluorescence in smokers (Skdld et al., 1989) or the constitution of a steady-state equilibrium
which would be dependent on the RASS concentration rather than the daily or accumulating
dose. The nature of the MS-dependent fluorescence is still open, and similar causes have
been discussed as for the histologically observed AM pigmentation (e.g., Skdld et al., 1992).
A possible relationship between AM pigmentation and fluorescence remains to be

investigated.

The degree of body weight gain reduction observed for WB12 can be interpreted as a sign
of toxicity and demonstrates that the study design would satisfy the requirements set by the

OECD (1981) or others for the highest dose level in a carcinogenicity study.
