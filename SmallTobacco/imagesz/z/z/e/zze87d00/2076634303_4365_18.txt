exposure chambers were between 22 and 24 °C (SD: 12C). These environmental conditions

complied with the exposure conditions specified by the OECD (1981).

In-Life Observations

There was no RASS-related mortality. Shortly after the end of the daily exposure, detailed
checks of the rats revealed findings that occurred more often in rats in one or both high RASS
concentration groups than in those of the sham-exposed group, /¢., secretion from the
Harderian glands, slight yellow-brown discoloration of the fur, and impaired gripping ability. No
other RASS-associated effects on the general condition and behavior of the rats were

detected.

Signs of eye inflammation were found starting at 7 months peaking at 9 months of
inhalation and were predominantly found in WBO and HO12 (40 to 50 % of all rats) and less
frequently in WB6 and WB12 (approximately 10 %). A cross-check of the data revealed no

influence on the results of the study.

Biomonitoring

RASS Uptake Statistically significant decreases in respiratory frequency were seen in
the whole-body exposed rats accompanied by a tendency to increased tidal volume resulting
in slight decreases in the minute volume. For example, after 5 months of inhalation, the
minute volume was 180 + 7, 168 + 8, and 162 + 7 ml/min (mean + SE) for WBO, WB6, and
WB12, respectively. The respiratory minute volume for HO12 rats was 130 + 6 mi/min. Daily
RASS TPM doses were calculated taking into account these differences in respiratory minute
volume, body weight, TPM concentrations, and daily exposure durations, the results being

2.8, 6.0, and 3.1 mg/kg body weight for WB6, WB12, and HO12, respectively. Thus, apart
