DISCUSSION

The chemical characterization of the RASS used in the present study is the most
comprehensive characterization of SS in an inhalation study to date. It allows a detailed
comparison of RASS to ETS. The most coherent and representative recent publication on
ETS composition involved volunteers in an environmental chamber who smoked the 50 top-
selling US cigarette brands (Martin et al., 1997). Respirable suspended particles (RSP) as
reported in this study can be considered to be solely particulate matter due to the controlled
conditions employed, and would thus correspond to the definition of TPM in the present study.
On the basis of TPM or RSP, the high RASS concentration in the present study was about 10-
fold higher than the extreme ETS concentrations employed in the market cigarette study
(Martin et al., 1997) (Figure 7). The ratios of the other SS constituents determined in both
studies are in the same order of magnitude suggesting a propartional composition of 1R4F
RASS and ETS generated from market cigarettes. In the most thorough recent ETS field
study performed in 16 US cities, only those ETS constituents were determined which have
generally been used as ETS markers (Jenkins et al., 1996). The comparison of the ETS
concentrations of these constituents to those determined in RASS again supports the

representative character of RASS for ETS (Figure 7).

The RASS concentrations in the present study were 2 to 3 orders of magnitude above the
ETS concentration determined by Jenkins et al. (1996) in smokersâ€™ homes, and approximately
2 orders of magnitude above maximum average RSP concentrations contributed by ETS for
residential (0.1 ug/l} and office (0.06 pg/!} environments reported by the US EPA (1992).
Based on these RSP concentrations and a respiratory minute volume of 7 l/min for a 70 kg

person, the daily RSP dose taken up in residences during 16 h and in offices during 8 h can
