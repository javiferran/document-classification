Thanks to you both for your input. Dick, the information on Labstat is excellent and | have included the data as a Table.
Are you all OK with the use of the words "flavorant" and "processing aids." What about "formulation aids"?

Enciosed is tha next draft.

Two portions are highlighted, both of which could ba ramoved. Regarding the second portion (alking about rate of
absorption), this comes from our answer to Markey, with references, plus a direct response to the Pankow claims.
Aerosols are not mentioned; vapor phase is. The inclusion of a discussion about rate is necessary only if the audience
receiving this is sophisticated enough to understand the issues. Certainly, we do rot want to provide a complex answer
which confuses folks, when a simply one would work.
