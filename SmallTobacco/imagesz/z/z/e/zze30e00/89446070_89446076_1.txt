Design

A blind, paired comparison test was employed to test the
prototype against the current product. All smokers were male
Marlboro Lights Box 80’s smokers between 18-29 years of age.

Each respondent received four packs of one version of the product
and was subsequently mailed four packs of the other product. A
phone evaluation followed after trial of the second product.

Product specs are as follows:

Current Harley Lights Box 9.2 mgs. tar’ .67 mg. nic.
Prototype Harley Lights Box 8.2 mgs. tar .68 mg. nic.

Executive Summary

The Harley Lights prototype did not meet the Action Standard as
indicated by the directional loss (80% confidence level) in
Overall Preference and the significantly lower (90% confidence
level) Purchase Interest (% definitely/probably would buy) it
received relative to current Harley Lights.

Among total smokers, the prototype was perceived as significantly
less smooth. The older respondents within this study, those
between 25-29 years of age, were especially critical in their
evaluations of the pretstype as thay cited it to be harsher in
taste, not light enough, and less smooth than the current
product. These differences were significant.

Detailed Findings

directionally among total respondents and younger adult
