RE: Topline: Current Harley Lights Box 80’s Vs.
Proto Harley Lights Box 80’s In-Home
Product Test MPID #5545/294 :
eyo

This presents the topline results for the In-Home product test
conducted for the prototype Harley Lights Box 80’s versus the
current Harley Lights Box 80’s.

Background

When producing the Harley Light Box 80’s product, R&D was
confronted with significant manufacturing problems.

Specifically, the current box product was not found to be close
enougc in taste characteristics to that of tne 85’s sott pack
version. Additionally, the box product varied as R&D had trouble
maintaining the product’s specifications.

Thus, R&D developed a revised Harley Lights Box product that
employed a new filter which enabled the prototype to have taste
characteristics that were closer to the king size Harley Lights.

Please note, since the time this study was initiated, R&D has
resolved the manufacturing problem and is now producing a
consistent box 80’s product that successfully meets product
specifications.

Objective

The Action Standard set for this study was a parity or better
performance for the prototype versus the current Harley Lights
Box 80’s product among Marlboro Lights Box 80’s smokers.
