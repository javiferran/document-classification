Conclusions

The prototype did not meet The Action Standard. It is therefore
recommended that Marketing not consider replacing the current box
product with the prototype.

Forward Action

At present, a slightly revised version of the current Harley
Lights 85’s product is being panel tested. When those results
are available in mid-July, R&D and Management will discuss the
next steps regarding further product development work regarding
the various Harley Lights packings.

A final report for this study will be available the week of July
18th.
