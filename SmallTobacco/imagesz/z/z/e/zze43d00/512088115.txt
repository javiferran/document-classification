RJR Interoffice Memorandum
Scientific Affairs Division

TO: Cc. D. McGee

FROM: Ms. Barbara Collie
Dr. J. H. Reynolds

DATE: September 18, 1991

SUBJECT: Prototype with Natural Chocolate Flavor #601442

Scientific Affairs understands you wish to conduct panel
testing on a full-flavor prototype (966C) using Natural Chocolate
Flavor #601442 from the Hagelin Company. The chocolate will be
used in the burley casing at a level of 0.29% of the total blend.
Approximately 30 panelists will be testing one prototype each which
has a WINSTON KS configuration with a 'â€˜'tar' level of 16
mg/cigarette.

Scientific Affairs approves the use of this flavor for the
panel evaluation as described above. Since all ingredients are
currently in use by RJRT, you do not need to go to the HRRC prior
to going to panel. However, should this flavor be further tested
in any other type of sensory evaluation or test market, Scientific
Affairs should be consulted. Additional review may be necessary,
based upon your proposed conditions of use.
