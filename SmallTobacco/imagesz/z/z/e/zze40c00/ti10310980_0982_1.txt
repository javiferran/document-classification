projected to show no difference in lung cancer among single
women and wives of nonsmokers, on the one hand, and wives of
smokers on the other.

Adding to the confusion, Hirayama also failed to repeat
another observation he derived from the same study population six
years ago -- that the overall standard mortality rate for married
women is only half that for singles. In addition, he made no
current reference to his earlier reported findings that such
rates vary depending on cooking and heating methods, home venti-
lation, and diet and nutritional factors such as type and frequency
of hot drinks and consumption of green and yellow vegetables.

These and other discrepancies in his January article led to
serious questioning in letters to the British journal from scientists
in the U.S. and Europe.

Garfinkel's newer report notes that physiologic changes
thought by some to be forerunners of lung cancer are rarely found
in nonsmokers. Hirayama made no such reference.

Garfinkel not only found no elevation of lung cancer among
women whose husbands smoked, based on raw data, but observed
the same thing when matching couples for other possible confounding
variables such as race, educational attainment, rural or urban
residence and occuptional exposures to suspected cancer-causing
substances.

Both studies were based on death certificate statements
of death causes. Hirayama made no reference to the reliability

of such data. But Garfinkel noted its significant lack of
