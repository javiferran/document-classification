DRAFT STATEMENT, GARFINKEL/HIRAYAMA, WK 4/20/81

A widely headlined report from Japan that smokers expose
their wives to lung cancer has been refuted in a new American
study.

In a population four times that of the Japanese study and
over a longer period, the American Cancer Society's chief
statistician has disclosed that "nonsmokers married to smoking
husbands showed no increased risk of cancer compared to non-
smoking women married to nonsmoking husbands."

The U.S. report, by Lawrence Garfinkel, appearing in the
May issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, is
based on a follow-up of more than a million Americans enrolled
two decades ago by Cancer Society volunteers.

The Japanese study, authored by Takeshi Hirayama, a Japanese
government statistician, appeared last January in the British
Medical Journal. It produced a rash of news stories, editorials
and demands for smoking prohibitions, from writers and others who
presumed its accuracy.

Hirayama's reported findings among some 265,000 residents
in parts of his country showed a reported lung cancer death rate
of 10.4 per hundred thousand among women whose husbands do not
smoke and 14.6 for women whose husbands are smokers.

By implication, Hirayama's data projected an even higher
rate -- 18 -- for single women. But he failed to report on either
smoking or lung cancer rates among the substantial number of
single women in his study population. However, if these do not

differ from married women's rates, the Japanese experience can be
