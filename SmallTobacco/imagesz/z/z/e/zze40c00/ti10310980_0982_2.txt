reliability. For example, based on medical confirmation and
microscopic examination, he stated that among female nonsmokers
â€œabout one-third of the 34 deaths that were attributed to lung
cancer on the death certificates...were breast cancers."

Due to severe geographic and other enrollment limitations,
neither study is regarded as projectable to any population beyond
the individuals actually observed in it.

The Japanese study population was identified in census
questionnaires in 1965, with no additional information about
changes in smoking patterns or other possible relevant factors
gathered since then. The Cancer Society population was first
enrolled in 1959 and has been subjected to several follow-ups
covering a wide variety of additional information.

Following the burst of "conclusive" news coverage of
Hirayama's report in the U.S., The Tobacco Institute on March 2
sent him 16 questions in an attempt to clarify it. Hirayama
failed to respond.

He is known for his anti-tobacco bias, and complained
about smoking in public several years ago when a group of Japanese

formed a "Society of People to Establish the Right to Hate Smoking."
