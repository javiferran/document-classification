MEMORANDUM
June 14, 1995

P Ns AL

TO: D. R. Tedder
FROM: L. E. Burch
SUBJECT: Tobacco Inventory for ATCo.

Should Lorillard purchase the subject brands from BWT, we suspect that tobaccos in
our inventories will be compatible to some of the tobaccos used in their blends. However,
we are certain their blends include tobaccos not available in our inventory.

Depending on the availability in our inventories and/or the marketplace, we will need
to purchase from BWT, a minimum of 24 months inventory of some grades used in the
products, as of July 1, 1995.

We estimate that should Lorillard purchase these brands, we would need to increase

our inventories by approximately $60 million.
