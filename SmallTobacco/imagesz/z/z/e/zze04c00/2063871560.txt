Dear Helmut,

This note will serve as confirmation that the proposal from Dr. D, Leyden entitled “Proposal to Determine
the Potential for Significant Dietary Intake of Nicotine and Cotinine by Nonsmokers and Assessment and
Documentation of Current Knowledge Related to the Analytical Methodology and Pharmacokinetics of
Nicotine Metabolites” has been reviewed by the Scientific Research Review Committee (SRRC) and has
been approved, pending availability of funds, which you will be managing.

Please let me know if you need anything else. I'll look forward to talking with you soon.
