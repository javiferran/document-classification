Re: Grant 954-B.
Dear Doctor Cohen:

Before we can approve a travel allocation for
a trip abroad we should know the name or names of the meeting
or meetings to be attended, the duration of the meeting, the
time of travel and the title of the presentations.to be made.
In general it is not the policy of The Council to encourage
travels to foreign coummtries for the purpose of presenting a
paper mless they are combined with invitations to working
conferences or some particularly needed visit to some
laboratories. I am quite sure that no special allocation would
be made for this purpose. If it can be done with the support-
committed funds it might be approved if the requested information
is available.

Sincerely,

William U. Gardner, Ph.D.
Scientific Director
