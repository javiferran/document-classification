(11) PRINT ON TIPPING

@ QUALITY OF PRINTED GRAPHICS ON THE CIGARETTE HAS BEEN PROVEN TO
SHAPE CONSUMER'S PERCEPTION OF PRODUCT QUALITY ITSELF.

@ MOCK-UPS OF OUR CURRENT PRINT ON THE BARREL PRODUCTS TO A PRINT

ON THE TIPPING HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED.

@ IT IS LIKELY THAT THE FF 85MM STYLES WILL NOT CHANGE FROM PRINT

ON THE BARREL, SOME LIGHT 85MM AND FF 100MM STYLES WILL BE LOOKING
AT REVISED DESIGNS OF PRINT ON THE TIPPING BEFORE A FINAL DECISION

IS MADE. PROTOTYPES ARE STILL UNDER REVIEW WITH DECISIONS EXPECTED
BY 7/1/89.
