On a per puff basis samples X6DEBC, X6DEBE, and X6DEBG
gave similar ammonia deliveries. Samples X6DEBD gave

a per puff delivery some 20% higher, outside the usual
410% range found for this method to date. On the basis
of the limited number of samples examined it would appear
that this additional ammonia is delivered preferentially
during the latter puffs. Sample X6DEBF gave a total and
per puff ammonia delivery some ten times that of the
other samples, again weighted more heavily towards the

latter puffs.
