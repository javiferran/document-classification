It should pe noted that these data are consistent with previous

studies examining the effect of particulate matter on attribute

perception. The following is a summary of the findings of these
previous studies.

The only attribute which seems out of place is that of Burley. In the
first tests, Burley decreased dramatically, but lately that change has
gotten smaller and, in this experiment, there was an increase in
Burley, although the change was not significant.

Other than Burley, it is evident that the experiments are very
consistent in showing a decrease in the attributes of Impact, Eye
Irritation, Nasal Irritation, Astringent and Paper. The experiments
were also consistent in showing no change in Ashtray and an increase
in Sweet. Ammonia showes a patterm similar to that of Burley but
might be a little more consistent is showning a decrease with
decreased WTPM.
