Condition 1 represents a situation where there is one filter pad in the top
filter holder and no filter pad in the lower filter holder. In this
condition, about 1.5 mg less WPM is trapped than in the average of the
conditions where there were tuo filter pads. Since each filter pad actually
traps in excess of 99% of the TPM, I take this discrepancy to represent water
being picked up by the second filter pad. Also, it might be expected that
the true TPM collected on each filter pad could be as much as tS milligrams
different than that determined, maybe even more. However, it should give
atleast some indication of the magnitude of removal of particulate matter in
the absence of more accurate analytical methods.
