Record Retention Procedures
Council for Tobacco Research - CTR Special Projects

This will confirm my fax transmission to you of the
attached page from the Law Department records of records in
storage.

I have instructed you to communicate to me all
requests for approval of scheduled destruction of all
documents relating to the Council for Tobacco Research (CTR)
and CTR Special Projects. (As an additional safeguard, and
until advised otherwise by me, you will transmit to me all
requests for scheduled destruction of any documents on Legal
Department manifests. I have also alerted Ron Goldbrenner.)
NO DESTRUCTION OF CTR OR CTR SPECIAL PROJECTS DOCUMENTS IS TO
BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT MY PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL.

You have advised me that additional CTR and CTR
Special Project materials also appear on record retention
manifests prepared by Doctors Schultz and Spears.
Accordingly, I instructed that a similar embargo on the
destruction of any such records is now also imposed, with
requests for any destruction of those materials to come to me
for approval.

You have undertaken to check all of your records for
any references to CTR and CTR Special Projects, and to furnish
me with copies .of those manifests, indicating source and
scheduled destruction dates.
