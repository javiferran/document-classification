applied to *4C-NNN, with similar results, although there had been
much less decomposition of this material. ‘47

Due to the need for analysis of samples with very low levels of
nitrosamines, requiring better accuracy and precision as well as
lower detection limits, it became necessary to optimize GC
programs, TEA parameters and integrator methods. *4®

A method was developed for analysis of VNA and TSNA in a single
sample, using one sample injection into the GC/TEA to measure both
classes of nitrosamines.?4
