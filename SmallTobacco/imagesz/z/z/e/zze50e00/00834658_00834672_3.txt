5. Is it a simply branched (I) acyclic aliphatic (A) hydrocarbon
or a common carbohydrate?

This drops out the generally innocuous hydrocarbons and carbo-
hydrates.

6. Is the substance a benzene derivative bearing substituents con-
sisting only of (a) hydrocarbon chains or I'-hydroxy or hydroxy
ester-substituted hydrocarbon chains and (b) one or more alkoxy

groups, one of which must be para to the hydrocarbon chain
in (a)?

This places in class III safrole. myristicin and related substances.

7. Is the substance heterocyclic?

8. Is it a lactone or cyclic diester?

This question separates the lactones and cyclic diesters from other
heterocyclic compounds.

9. Is it a lactone fused to another ring, or a five- or six-membered
a,B8-unsaturated lactone?

This places certain lactones known or suspected to be of unusual
toxicity in class HI.

*if it is a lactone, from this point on treat the structure as if
it were the hydroxy acid in the form of its more stable tautomer
and proceed to question 20 if it is open chain, to 10 if it is
heterocyclic and to 23 if it is carbocyclic; if it is a cyclic diester
treat as the separate components.

10. Is it a 3-membered heterocycle?

This places such substances as the epoxides and ethylenimine in
class III.

11. Disregarding only the heteroatoms in any one ring, does
that heterocyclic ring contain or bear substituents other than
simply branched (I) hydrocarbons (including bridged chains and
monocyclic aryl or alkyl structures), alkyl alcohols, aldehydes,
acetals, ketones, ketals, acids, esters (including cyclic esters other
than lactones), mercaptans, sulphides, methyl ethers, hydroxy or
single rings (hetero or aryl) with no substituents other than those
just listed?
Questions 11-15 separate out various categories of heteroaromatic
substances. Under 11, set aside and do not consider the atom(s),
usually oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur, making the Ting heterocyclic.
If there is more than one hetero ting, regard each ring separately,
with the remainder of the structure as substituents of that hetero
ring. Other than the heterocyclic atom(s), does the ring carry any-
thing besides the simple groups listed? If so, the answer is ‘yes’
