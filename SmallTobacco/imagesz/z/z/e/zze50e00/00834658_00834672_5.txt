Question 18 examines the terpenes (and later the open-chain
and mononuclear substances by reference) to determine whether
they contain certain structural features generally thought to be
associated with some enhanced toxicity.

20. Is the structure a linear or simply branched (I) aliphatic (A) 22 () 2 #0
compound containing any one or combination of only the follow- conn CH;CCOH

ing functional groups (E): (a) four or less, each, of alcohol, alde- YES

of the following: acetal, either ketone or ketal but not both, mer-
captan, sulphide (mono- or poly-), thioester, polyoxyethylene
[(—OCH,CH,—), with x no greater than 4], or primary or ter-
tiary amine?
This question should be answered ‘yes’ if the structure contains
one or any possible combination of alcoholic, aldehydic or carboxy-
lic acid or ester groups, provided there are no more than four of
any one kind. It should be answered ‘yes’ if the structure contains
in addition to, or instead of, those just listed, any assortment of
no more than one each of the following: acetal, either ketone or
ketal but not both, mercaptan, mono- or polysulphide, thioester,
polyoxyethylene, primary or tertiary amine. Answer the question
‘no’ if the structure contains more than four of any of the first
set of groups, more than one of the second set, or any substituent
not listed,
