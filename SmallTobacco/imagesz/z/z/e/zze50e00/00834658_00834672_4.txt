and the next question 33. If not. then classify further by question
12 et seg. Bridged-chain derivatives may be represented by struc-
tures like the bicyclic ether 1,4-cineole while monocyclic aryl de-
rivatives may be represented by compounds like benzaldehyde
propylene glycol acetal or 3-pheny!-2-furancarboxaldehyde.

12. Is it heteroaromatic (B)?

This question separates the aromatic heterocyclics for the purpose

of considering whether they are polynuclear (question 14) or un-
substituted (question 13).

13. Does the ring bear any substituents?

14. Does the structure contain more than one aromatic (B) ring?

15. Is it readily hydrolysed (H) to mononuclear residues? (If yes,
treat the mononuclear heterocyclic residues by question 22 and
any carbocyclic residue by question 16.)

16. Is it a common terpene (D)-hydrocarbon, -alcohol, -aldehyde
or -carboxylic acid (not a ketone)?
Questions 16 and 17 deal with terpenes. A hydrocarbon terpene
that is a common terpene (D) and has not already been put in
class I by question 5, would go into class I by question 16.

17. Is the substance readily hydrolysed (H) to a common terpene

(D), -alcohol, -aldehyde or -carboxylic acid? (If the answer is

yes, treat the hydrolysed residues separately and proceed to 18

for the terpene moiety and to 19 for any non-terpenoid moiety.)
Since there may be substances that are hydrolysed to two or more
residues, one of which is a terpene, treat the residues separately
from question 18 onward to conclusion.

18. Is the substance one of the following:
(a) a vicinal diketone; or a ketone or ketal of a ketone
attached to a terminal vinyl group
(b) a secondary alcohol or ester of a secondary alcohol
attached to a terminal vinyl group
(c) allyl alcohol or its acetal, ketal or ester derivative
(d) allyl mercaptan, an allyl sulphide, an allyl thioester
or allyl amine
(e) acrolein, a methacrolein or their acetals
(f) acrylic or methacrylic acid
(g) an acetylenic compound
(h) an acyclic aliphatic (A) ketone, ketal or ketoalcohol with
no other functional groups and with four or more carbons
on either side of the keto group
(i) a substance in which the functional groups (E) are all steri-
cally hindered (J).
