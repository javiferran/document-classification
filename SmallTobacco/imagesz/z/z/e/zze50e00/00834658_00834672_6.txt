25. Is the substance (a) a cyclopropane or cyclobutane with only
the substituents mentioned in question 24 or (b) a mono- or
bicyclic sulphide or mercaptan?

26. Does the structure contain no functional groups other than
those listed in question 24 and is it either a monocyloalkanone
or a bicyclic compound with or without a ring ketone?

27. Does (do) the ring(s) have any substituents?
Questions 27-31 deal with aromatic compounds.

28. Does the structure contain more than one aromatic (B) ring?

29. Is it readily hydrolysed (H) to mononuclear residues? (If yes
treat the individual aromatic mononuclear residues by question
30 and any other residue by question 19.)

30. Disregarding ring hydroxy or methoxy does the ring bear
substituents other than 1-5-carbon aliphatic (A) groups, either
hydrocarbon or containing alcohol, ketone, aldehyde, carboxyl
or simple esters that may be hydrolysed to ring substituents of
five or less carbons? (If a simple ester that may be hydrolysed,
treat the aromatic portion by question 18 and the residue by
question 19,)
This should be answered ‘no’ if the ring bears only aliphatic
groups of five carbons or less, which are either hydrocarbon in
nature or contain the groups listed. If the ring bears any other
substituents than those listed, the question should be answered
‘yes’ and one should proceed to question 31.

31. Is the substance an acyclic acetal, -ketal or -ester of any
of the above substances (see question 30)? (If yes, assume hy-
drolysis and treat the non-aromatic residues by question 19 and.
the aromatic residue by question 18.)
This question is simply designed to see whether the substance
would fit within the definition of question 30 if it were not an
acetal, a ketal or an ester. In other words, would the substance
carry only the groups listed in question 30.

32. Does the substance contain only the functional groups (E)
listed in question 30, or their derivatives listed in question 31,
but with any or all of the following: (a) a single fused non-aroma-
tic carbocyclic ring, (b) aliphatic (A) substituent chains longer than
five carbon atoms, or (c) a polyoxyethylene [((—OCH,CH,—),
with x no greater than 4] chain either on the aromatic ring or
on an aliphatic (A) side chain?

Part (a) is intended to allow simple derivatives of tetralin into
class IT while putting polycyclic compounds such as the steroids
ultimately into class III except those that may be normal food
