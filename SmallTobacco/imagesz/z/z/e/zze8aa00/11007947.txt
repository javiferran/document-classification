Dear Sir:

Enclosed for your consideration are an original and two copies
of a manuscript entitled "Etiology of Atherosclerotic Disease: Carbon
Monoxide and Use of Statistics". The authors are R.J. Hickey and R.C.
Clelland. We submit this manuscript for consideration as a "Commentary"
article for publication in The American Journal of Epidemiology.

If otherwise acceptable, the opening quotation of Artemus Ward
may be deleted or retained at the discretion of the Editor. It is
included only as a brief expression to set the tone.

Since this article is somewhat critical of the claims of certain
investigators, a rebuttal might be appropriate in the event our paper
should be found acceptable.

All correspondence should be with the undersigned.

Sincerely,

Richard J. Hickey
RJH/gfl
