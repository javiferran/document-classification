| SUBJECT: BUDGET IMPAC

 

As you know, we are in the midst of a K-Mart reset which wiil effect virtually every K-Mart
store throughout the country over the next couple of months. To support this reset, we have
ordered PFD Units and Springfed Package Fixture parts to various warehouses throughout
the U.S. As some of you may have noticed, these fixtures have negatively impacted your
merchandising budget, if in fact one of these fixtures storage areas falls within your
region/division boundaries. Please note that upon completion of the re-merchandising
program, our plans are to adjust region/division budgets based on the number of K-Mart
stores which actually fall under your accountabilities.

| hope this clears up any questions you may have had relative to the budgetary issue.
Please feel free to contact me should you have any questions.

Sincerely

Sunnis
