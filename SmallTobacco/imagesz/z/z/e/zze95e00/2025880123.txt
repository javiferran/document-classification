Brilip Morris executives have
reason to be bullish on tobacco, They
oversee an empire with 113,000 em-
ployees worldwide, about 1,200 of
whom work in the company’s 26-story
sleek gray building on Park Avenue
overlooking Grand Central Terminal.

This is a company where employees
are offered a free carton of cigarettes
every week and where receptionists an-
