T in

California has initially rejected the production of a heat transfer stamp; PM USA
will do everything possible to expedite development of the stamp, but an agreement
has not yet been reached. Until then, the water applied stamp must be used. The
state currently has 3mm water based stamps on hand.

Hawaii is a no tax-stamp State.

Hand Stamping Allowance

The current handstamping allowance is $.20 per carton on an ongoing basis. It has
come to Brand's attention that this allowance is inadequate to cover the necessary
time and labor involved in handstamping with a water based stamp.

The new handstamping allowance for water based stamps only will be $.25 per
carton, from Nov. 15 - Dec. 31, 1992. At that date, Brand will re-evaluate the need

for this allowance based on the availability of a heat applied stamp.

Wholesale/Retail Allowances

To ensure proper sell-in, both wholesale and retail allowances have been further
extended. Wholesale allowances are extended to Nov, 27, 1992. Retail allowances
are extended to Dec, 15, 1992.
