Fig. 9. The measurement of the synthesis of the viral proteins in infected PEJRat2 and NB324K cells. [2*S]Methonine-labeled cell lysates
{18-20 hr postinfection) were immunoprecipitated with hamster anh-H- 1 serum (A, 1-6) or with rabbit anu-NS1 antibody{B, 1-6). Samples of the
total cell lysates (4. 7-9) or nuclear extracts (A, 10~11) from infected PEJRat2 without immunoprecipitation were ‘duectly loaded onto the 7.5%
polyacrylamde-SDS gel. The sizes of the protemn bands were measured as inFig. 3B. Mock intections, A, lanes } , 4, and 7. and B, lanes 3 and 6;

observed in cell culture. The extensive CPE seen in
H-18A-infected rat fibroblasts at high m.o.1. (m.o.1.
= 100) could be the result of the cytotoxic effect of
NS1. Our data and that of others have suggested that
nonstructural proteins, mainly NS1, are the major cyto-
cidal component of parvoviruses (Rhode, 1987a; Li
and Rhode, 1990; Cornelis era/., 1990; Caillet-Fauquet
ef af., 1990).

 

Fx. 10, Norther blot analysis of the viral mRNA in infected
PEMet2 cells. Total RNAS were extracted 20 Kr postinfection and
analyzed by Northern blot as descnbed in the text. Fiva micrograms
ot total RNA for each lane was denaturated in glyoxal and loaded
onto @ 1.4% agarose ge!. The RNAs were then transfered to a S&S
Nytran nylon membrane and hybridized to P-labeled pGlu883 DNA

The exact mechanism for the deficiency of virus par-
ticle assembly in NS2 mutant-infected cells remains to
be determined. in rat cells, NS2 appeared to play a role
in both viral DNA replication and protein synthesis, al-
though we do not know whether NS? is directly or indi-
rectly involved in these activities. There is no evidence
so far that NS2 participates in parvovirus DNA replica-
tion. The reduction of H-1SA RF DNA and the 8-kb
replicative intermediate in rat cells may result from the
lower expression of NS1 and/or capsid protein. Obvi-
ously, this reduction in viral DNA is not enough to ac-
count for the severe defect in virus production seen in
rat cells. Interestingly, H-iSA SS DNA is severely defi-
Cient in rat cells in the absence of NS2, suggesting that
NS2 is required for the accumulation of viral SS prog-
eny DNA, probably as an indirect result of the low level
of capsid protein synthesis. A similar observation was
also obtained in an adeno-associated virus (AAV) mu-
tant in which the expression of P19-coded rep52 and
rep40 were abolished (Chejanovsky and Carter, 1989).
This mutant was also deficient in accumulation of SS
progeny DNA and infectious viral particles, but unlike
H-1SA, the AAV mutant exhibited a normal duplex RF
DNA replication and viral capsid protein synthesis
({Chejanovsky and Carter, 1989). Although rep52 and
rep40 may be analogues of the NS2 proteins of the
autonomous Parvoviruses, the genomic organization
and regulation of expression of AAV genes are signifi-
cantly different from the autonomous parvoviruses.
The data for AAV and the autonomous parvoviruses
indicates that the generation of parvovirus duplex RF
DNA and SS DNA may be regulated separately.
