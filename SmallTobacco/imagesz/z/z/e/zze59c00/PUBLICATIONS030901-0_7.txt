fuged on a sucrose gradient as described in the text. Twenty trac-
tions (200 yl gach) were Collected from the bottom of the tube One

precipitated in methanol and electrophoresed in 7.5%
PAGE-SDS gel. H-1 VP1 and VP2 appeared to be the
major components in these fractions (Fig. 6, inset).

The replication of H-1SA RF DNA is reduced, and
SS DNA and an 8-kbp viral DNA are deficient
in rat fibroblasts

The kinetics of H-1SA and H-1 viral DNA replication
were analyzed by Southern blotting in both NB324K
and PEJRat2 cells after a synchronized intection. The
amplification of H-1 RF DNA become apparent at Shr
and reached a peak at 16 hr postinfection (Fig. 7). The
level of the H-1 RF DNA stayed high through the late
times of the infection. The replication of H-1SA wes
slightly reduced in NB324 cells, about twofold lower at
16 hr compared to H.1 (Fig. 7A), and the reduction was
more severe in H-1SA-infected PEJRat2, as jow as Six-
to seventoid less than H-1 {Fig. 7B). The decline of
H-1SA RF DNA accumulation was consistently seen in
PEJRat2 cells at late times of the infection (16-24 hr

postinfection (Fig. 8, lanes 5-7). The accumulation of
H-1 SS DNA in PEJRat2 celis was maximal by 16 hr
postinfection and remained at approximately the same
level to 24 hr postinfection (Fig. 8, lanes 1-3). The ac-
cumulation of H-1SA SS DNA was very low in compari-
son to wild-type H-1 (Fig. 8, lanes 5-7). By quantitating
the gels, the ratio of RF monomer (RFm) to SS DNA for
H-1 was about 2.5 to 1, whereas the ratio of RFnvS$
for H-1SA was about 10 to 1. An 8-kbp viral DNA band
was also observed in H-1-infected PEJRat2 cells (Fig.
8, lanes 1-3), whereas it was absent in the H-1SA-in-
fected celis (Fig. 8, lanes 5-7). This viral-specific DNA
form has been characterized and reported as 4 replica-
tive intermediate during virus replication (Faust and
Gloor, 1984).

The virat protein synthesis is deficient in H-1SA-
infected rat cells but the viral mRNAs are normal

The synthesis of H-1SA and H-1 proteins in rat fitro-
blasts and NB cells was compared by using immuno-
precipitation to evaluate the role of NS2 in the regula-
tion of viral protein synthesis. The synthesis of H-1SA
capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2) and NS1 in NB324K
cells was about 60-70% of wild-type H-1 (Fig. 9A, 3vs
2, and Fig. 9B, 4 vs 5). The reduced amount of the
highly phosphorylated 88-kDa H-1SA NSt band in NB
cells (Fig. 9B, 4 vs 5, NS1*) accounted for the reduction
in the total NS1 for the mutant. in H-1SA-infectad
PEJRat2 cells, however, the synthesis of NS1 and cap-
Sid proteins was only about 10% of the amount trom
wild-type virus (Fig. 9A, 6 vs 5, and Fig. 9B, 1 vs 2).
Total cell lysates (Fig. 9A, 7-9) and nuclear extracts
(Fig. 9A, 10-11) were also included in the analysis for
PEJRat2 celis to confirm the reduction in the tevel of
4H-1SA VP2 synthesis without immiunopracipitation
(Fig. 9A, 8 vs 9, and Fig. 9A, 10 vs 11}. There was rio
apparent corresponding reduction in the synthesis cf
Cellular proteins in the H-1SA-infected cells compared
tocells infected with wild-type H-1. Furthermore, immu.
nofluorescent staining in PEJRat2 also indicated the
reduction in NSt and capsid protein accumulation, but
the nuclear localization of H-1SA proteins was normal
(not shown). ,

To determine whether the deficiancy in H-1SA viral
Protein synthesis is at the transcriptional or transia-
tional level, steady-state levels of viral mRNAs were
analyzed by Northern blot. The three expected wild-
type H-1 transcripts, R1 (4.8 kb), R2(3.2 kb) and R3(2.9
kb), were visualized (Fig. 10, lane 3). H:1SA RI and R4
mRNAs appeared to have the same abundance as wild
type (Fig. 10, lane 2 vs 3)in égreement with the data for
R3 by primer extension analysis described above. Fur-
thermore, the viral mRNAs were tested for translatabil-
