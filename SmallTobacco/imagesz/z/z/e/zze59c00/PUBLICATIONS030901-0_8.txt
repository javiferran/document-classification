Fig. 7. The kineves of H-1 and H-1SA ONA reptication in synchronized infection of NB324K. and PEJRat2 cells. Cells were synchronzed by
using isoleucine depnvation and aphidicolin blockage as descnbed in Materigis and Methods. The wiral DNAs ware collected at the time points
indicated tn the figure and analyzed by Southem blotting. A Mindlll-restncted plasmid pBNS2 (4.2 kb) containing H-? NS1/NS2 gene sequences
Was used a8 an internal control. Two hundred nanograms of p8NS2 DNA was added to the lysed cells at each ume pointand recovered along
with the viral rephcatwe-form (RF) DNA. This intemal control frovided 8 quantialive evaluation and édjustment tor vaiations of viral DONA
recovery. The extracted viral DNAs were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose ge! and transferred onto a Nytran nylon membrane (Schleicher and
Schuell). An EcoR}-restncted pGiu883 DNA (Rhode, 1989) was labeled with [a-™P}dCTP by the random pnmer method and used to probe the
membrane. The amounts of the radioactivity of the viral monomer RF DNAs were measured in a Betascope 603 blot analyzer (Belagen) and the

data were plotted as shown in the figure.

The hypothesis that NS2is required for full pathogen- infected hamsters and rats as well as from H-1SA-in-
esis in the natural animal host was tested using new- fected hamsters, but not from H-1SA-infected new-
born Syrian hamsters and Wistar rats as model sys- born rats. The majority of the virus recovered from
