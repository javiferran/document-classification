and the mutation at the 3 splice acceptor site of ihe NS2 large
intron. The positions of the slart codon, terminator. and the 3" and S°
splice junctions of NS2 are indicated. NS1 1s composed o1 672
ammo acids and itis encoded by one exon. The 5° splice site al
517/8 and the 3’ splice site at 1992/3 determine the targe intron of
R2, the NS2 wansenpt. The mayor ssotorm of NS2 uses the donot
sequence at 2283/4 and the acceptor site at 2379/80 to remove the
small intron between its exon 2 and exon 3 The munor isoterm of
NS2 uses the §' ste at 2319/20 and the 3' site at 2401/2 and the
translation would then terminate at 2303 upstream ol its 5’ site. gen-

Infection of newborn hamsters and rats by
inoculation of H-¥ and H-1SA

Pregnant Syrian hamsters and Wistar rats were ob-
tained from the Eppley Institute Colony, University of
Nebraska Medical Center at Omaha. On the day of
birth, the litter was inoculated with H-1 or H-1SA in the
interscapular area at 500 PFU per hamster and 1000
PFU per rat suspended in 50 zl of PBS. The litters were
observed daily for dead animals. The livers and spleens
were taken from animals that died of infection or sacri-
ticed animals at 2- to 4-day intervals and homogenized
in TE buffer tor recovery of virus and subsequent
analysis.

RESULTS

Mutation at the 3’ splice acceptor site of intron 1 in
the H-1 NS2 gene abolishes the splicing of the R2
transcript and the synthesis of NS2 protein

The 5’ splice donor site and the 3’ spice acceptor
site of the NS2 intron 1 are located at nucleotides 517
and 1993 of the H-1 genome (Fig. 1). The conserved
dinucleotide AG at the 3’ site was mutated to CG (sold
underline}. In combination wrth two other silent muta-

tions for NS1 at 1994 (T-A) and 1997 (A-C), a new re
striction site for BamHt was generated at 1993 (dashe:
underline), which facilitated the screening of clone
with the mutation. The three nucleotide substitution
did not change the amino acid specificity for NS1. Thi
mutation was screened by using the new BamH! sit
and was further confirmed by restriction endonucless
mapping and complete DNA sequencing of the 20
nucleotides of the PCR products (BstEli 1888/Xbi
2088) to exclude the possibility of genomic rearrange
ment during ligation or errors by Taq polymerase dul
ing the PCR (data not shown).

For further characterization and investigation of th
mutation, the SA (splicing acceptor) mutation was intrc
duced into parvovirus H-1 RF DNA and an infectiou
clone of Lulll to generate mutant viruses H-1SA an
the chimeric virus LUH1SA (see Fig. 2). Northern biot
and primer extensions were carried out to determin
whether the NS2 mRNA ({R2)} is eliminated by the muté
tion. By Northern blot analysis, three viral MRNA band
were observed in NB324K, Hela Gey (data not showr
and PEJRat2 cells (Fig. 10) infected by H-+ or LuH1
These bands correspond to Rt (4.8 kb), R2 (3.2 kb
and R3 (2.9 kb). R2, however, appeared to be missin
in the mutant virus-infected cells (Fig. 10). Since R
was partially obscured by the more abundant R3 trar
scripts in Northern blots, we visualized the R2 trar
scripts more clearly by primer extension analysis
Primer extension showed that H-1SA was deficient i
R?2 in NB cells while the R3 transcripts remained una
fected (Fig. 3A, lane 3). A 31-mer primer starting fror
nucleotide 2097 of the H-1 genome produced a 44
nucleotide band for R2 and a 119 nucteotide band tc
R3 with the RNA trom the wild-type H-1-infected cu
ture (Fig. 3A, lane 2). The level of R2. if there is any. i
the culture infected by H-1SA was less than 4% of th
level of wild-type virus when the gel was scanned in
Betascope 603 blot analyzer (Betagen). The bac!
ground activity is likely due to prematurely terminate
reverse transcripts of R1. Probably due to the ineff
cient extension by M-MLV reverse transcriptase for th
relatively large sized R2, the H-1 R2/R3 ratio appeare
less than expected. Furthermore, NS2 protein was ut
detectable in NB324K cells infected by H-1SA by in
munoprecipitation of the lysate (Fig. 3B, lane 2
whereas 9 28-kDa protein band which corresponds 1
the size of NS2 was seen in the H- 1-infacted cell lysat
(Fig, 3B, lane 3). These results indicate that this mut
tion abolished the splicing of the R2 transcript of part
virus H-1 and prevented the synthesis of NS2 proteil
