2 Virus ters were determined by end-point dilution in NB324K
cells and converted to PFUsm! using the formula TCID,o/ml x 0.69
= PFU/mi.

> Virus ters were determined by a plaque assay in NB324K cells.

© OPE seen in H-1SA4ntected cells was caused by a revenant
virus. see text for further explanstion.

though NS2 seems to be dispensable in some cell lines
for productive infection by the autonomous parvovirus
H-1, it is required for efficient production of infectious
virus particles in rat fibroblasts.

MTT cytotoxicity assay

We have used the MTT colorimetric assay to mea-
sure the cel killing by H-1SA at different m.o.i. and the
reguits are shown in Fig. 4. The killing activity in both
H-+- and H-1SA-infected PEJRat2 cells was dose de-
pendent but the curve for H-1SA was shifted to the
right compared to H-1 (Fig. 4A), indicating that in the
absence of NS-2, rat fibroblasts are more resistant to
the killing by the virus. At an m.o.i. of 1, few cells were
killed by H-1SA (8); at a m.o.i. of 10, the cell survival
dropped down to about 65% at Days 2-3 postinfection

and the cultures were recovered afterwards (C); ¢
m.0.1. of 100, the cells were killed by H-1SA almost
efficiently as H-1 (D). These results suggest that H-1
kills intected rat fibroblasts, but because it produ:
little new virus, the CPE does not spread in the cultu
at low m.o.i.
