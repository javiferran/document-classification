Cells. Extensive CPEs were observed about 7 days
post-transfection. The mutant viruses to be used for
further studies were propagated in HaK cells at an
m™.0.), of 0.1 only once to reduce the generation of re-
vertant virus and to produce high titer stocks. The
H-1SA mutant was able to produce plaques in NB324K
cells as efficiently as the wild-type virus since the num-
ber of plaques generated by both the mutant and the
wild-type were proportional to their viral DNA contents
anaiyzed by DNA hybridization, but the size of the
plaques formed by H-1SA was smaller than H-1 (data
not shown).

A number of H- 1/Lulll permissive Cell lines trom hu-
man, rat, dog, and hamster origins were infected by the

mutant viruses. The time required for CPE and virus
titers at complete CPE were measured to evaluate the
role of NS2 during virus infection (Table 1). A delayed
CPE and about 100-fold lower virus production were
seen in the cells intected by the mutant Lulll-H1 chi-
meric virus, LuH1SA, compared to the wild-type chi-
mera, LuH1. There was no significant delay in CPE
development in most of the H-1SA-infected cell tines
but lower virus titers were observed. The reduction ot
H-18A virus titer in these cell lines varied ranging from
severalfold in hamster and dog cells to 20- to 60-fold in
human ceil lines (Table 1).

In contrast, a nonproductive infection by H-1SA was
seen in the rat fibroblast cell line, Rat?, and its H-ras-
transformed cell line PEJRat2. The rew virus produc-
tion in these rat fibroblasts wes at least 3 logs lower
than the wild-type H-1 titer Table 1). We have seen that
some small foci of CPE appeared at about Days 6-7 in
the H-1SA-infected Rat2 and PEJRat2 cultures at lower
m.0.i. (under 10) and these toci Spread slowly and even-
tually killed the cefls around 14 days after infection.
This CPE resulted from revertant viruses (x. Liand $.L:
Rhode, unpublished data). In contrast. the wild-type
H-1-infected cultures were completely killed by Days
4-5 after infection. These results indicate that al-

Fig. 3. The measurement of the viral transcripts and NS2 proten
for the mutant H-1SA_ (A) Pamer extension anslysis of viral tran-
scripts R2 and R3 in NB324K cells. The total RNA extracted ftom the
infected calls and the primer extensions were cared out as de-
Scribed in the text. Five micrograms of total RNA was used for each
feachon. A Haeill-restncted Phi-X174 DNA wes labeled with by-**P}-
ATP and used as markers, Lane 1, mock-treated; lane 2, H-1 in-
fected, and lane 3, H-1SA infected. The reaction generated a 440
nucleotide R2 and a 119 nucleptide R3, as expected. An RI product
of about 2 kb was not efficiently synthesized and wavalized in thig
gel (B) immunoprecipnation of NS2 Protein in infected NB324k
cells NS2 was immunopresipitated and analyzed ma 15% polyacryl-
amide SDS gel as described in the text. The aze of the protein
bands was measured by using SDS-PAGE molecular waight stan-
dards (Bi0-Rad). The standard proteins were Stained with 0.1% Coo-
Massie bniliant blue R-250 (Sigma). Lane 1, mock infected: lane 2,
H.1SA infected; and lane 3, H-1 infected.
