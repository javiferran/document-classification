118 LI AND RHODE

created a point mutation which converts the essential
dinucleotide AG to CG at the 3’ splice acceptor site of
intron 1 in the parvovirus H-1 NS2 gene without chang-
ing the codon specificity for NS1 (Fig. 1], We report
here that this mutation abolished the splicing of NS2
pre-mRNA and therefore blocked the synthesis of the
NS2 protein. By introducing the mutation into the parvo-
viruses H-1 and Lull, NS2- viruses were generated.
We have tound that NS2 plays its most important role
during the viral infection in rat cells, where rat is consid-
ered to be the natural host for H-1. But NS2 is largely
dispensable in other types of cells, such as human and
hamster cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell lines

The cell lines uséd in this study were: NB324K (sim-
ian virus 40-transformed human newborn kidney cell)
(Shein and Enders, 1962), Hela Gey (human cervix car-
cinoma cell} (ATCC CCL2. 1), Hak (Syrian Ramster kid-
ney cell) (ATCC CCL15), Rat2 (TK-rat fibroblast) (Topp,
1981), PEJRat2 (Harvey-ras transformed Rat2, H-ras
gene expressing plasmid pEJ was kindly supplied by R.
Weinberg), MRC-5 V2 (simian 40-transformed human
fibroblast) (Huschtscha and Holiday, 1983), DKSV (sim-
ian virus 40-transtormed dog kidney cell) (obtained
from Mr. R. G. Dumas, University of South Dakota, Ver-
million, SD), THK (simian virus 40-transformed hamster
kidney cell) (Kaplan e7 af, 1975}, and RN (rat nephroma)
(Babcock and Southam, 1967). All cell lines were
grown in monolayer culture in minimal essential me-
dium (MEM) with 5-10% fetal calf serum at 37°.

Site-directed mutaganesis with the polymerase
chain reaction and generation of the NS2
mutant virus

Four primers were synthesized on an Applied Bio-
systems Model 380B DNA synthesizer and desaited
over a C-18 Sep-Pak cartridge column (Millipore):

Primer 1. GTGAAGAATGGTTACCAATCTACCA-3’
plus strand

Primer 2. GAGCGCATgGAtCCgAGCGAATTTATAG-
3° minus strand

Primer 3. AATTCGCTcGGaTCcATGCGCTCACCA-3'
plus strand

Primer 4. AGTATTTGGTGTGCTCC-3' minus strand

Primer 1 contains a BstEl! site at nucleotide 1888 of
the H-1 genome (underlined sequence). Primers 2 and
3 both carry the mutations (mismatched bases are in-
dicated by lowercase letters) which create a new
Bam 1 site at nucleotide 1993. Primer 4 is located 10
nucleotides 3° to an Xbal site at 2088 of H-1. Primers 1

and 2 generate a mutated BstEl/BamH1 fragment of
105 nucleotide bp from 1888 to 1993, while primers 3
and 4 produce a 95-tp BamHi/Xbal fragment from
1993 to 2088 with the same rnutations. The PCR was
pertormed in an automatic thermal cycler {Perkin Elmer
Cetus) for 25 cycles by using the standard protocol as
recommended by the manufacturer. The annealing
temperatures were estimated by using a computer pro-
gram (VMB)(Campione-Piccardo, 1986); 45° was used
for primers 3 and 4 and 60° for primers 1 and 2. The
PCR products were cleaved by the appropriate restric-
tion endonucleases and purified on a 4% NuSieve
(FMC) agarose geil. The appropriate DNA fragments
were excised from the ge! and were recovered by elec-
troelution in dialysis tubing. The fragments were
cloned into a plasmid pH§ (Riiode, 19876}, which ex-
presses the H-1 NS1/NS2 gene, to generate a plasmid
PpH5SA. The experimental procedure is diagrammed in
Fig. 2. Mutations were contirmed by restriction endonu-
clease mapping and DNA sequencing.

To construct NS2 mutant viruses, a &g/ll/Xbal (12-46/
2088) fragment containing the mutetion from pHSSA
was subcioned into the plasmid pBNS1 AH to generate
PBNS1AHSA. The Hindlil site at 2655 of H-1 is missing
in PH but it is preserved in pBNS1 AH. Cloning of the
NS2 mutation in pBNS1AH allowed us to use the
Hindilt at 2655 of H-1 DNA for subcloning, The EcoR 1/
Hindi (1088/2655) fragment from pBNS1AHSA con-
taining the mutations wes introduced into the H-1 viral
replicatve form (RF) DNA to generate a mutant virus
H-1SA and into pLu, an infectious clone of Lull, to
create a mutant Lulll-H1 chimeric virus clone
pLuH1SA (see Fig. 2). As a positive control, the wild-
type EcoR1/Hindlil fragment from pBNS14H was
cloned into pLu to produce a clone of the wid-type
chimeric virus pLuH1. H-1 RF DNA used in the cloning
was extracted by the method of Hirt (1963) from
NB324K cells 20 hr postinfection, and the EcoR1
1/1088 and the Hindlll 2655/5 1 76 tragments were puri-
fied by ge! electrophoresis. pLu was constructed by
cloning the BamH?1 fragment of viral DNA from the in-
fectious Lull! plasmid pGLu883 (Rhode, 1989) into the
&g!li site of pUCBg2. pUCBg2 was made by ligating
oligonucleotides 5-AGCTTAGATCTT and 5'-AATTAA-
GATCT into pUC19 restricted with EcoR1 and Hindlil.
This created an inframa unique &g/\l site in the é-galac-
tosidase gene. The viral EcoR! and Hindill sites are
unique in this plasmid, as the resulting plasmid, eLu,
has no residual polylinker restriction sites flanking the
viral DNA insert.
