DISCUSSION

The eukaryotic 3’ splice site is an essential cis-acting
sequence element for pre-mRNA splicing in which the
AG dinucleotide is absolutely conserved. Mutation or
deletion of the AG dinucleotide reduces the lariat for-
mation and completely blocks the exon ligation during
the splicing process (Green, 1986). Our results indi-
Cate that a singte base mutation trom AG to CG at the z
Splice site bordering exon Z of the parvovirus H-1 NS2
gene abolishes the splicing of NS2 pre-mRNA. These
data are consistent with other reports in which point
Mutation of AG to GG or GG at the 3° site usually abol-
ishes synthesis of the specific proteins in sukaryouc
systems (Hedley ef o/, 1989: Tromp and Prockop,
1988: Nave er a/., 1987). Furthermore, we were unable

to detect any alternative form of R2 by primer extension
and Northern blot analysis, which could have been
generated by using cryptic 3’ splice sites. We also used
viral DNA probe from the left end of the genome int.
264-1088) which hybridized to R1 and R2 but notto R3
for Northern blot analysis. This probe revealed neither
normal R2 nor other forms of R2 for H-1SA that might
have been missed by primer extension and obscured
by R3 in a Northern blot using the whole viral genome
aS a probe (data not shown). These data suggest that
the 3' splice acceptor site at nucleotide 1993 ofthe H-1
genome is crucial for the removal of intron 1 of the NS2
gene.

Although the NS2 viral mutants LuH1SA and H-1SA
are capable of lytic growth in most of the cell lines we
have tested, NS2 seems to be required for the full effi-
ciency of cytopathogenesis and virus production in
these cell lines. THe chimeric mutant virus had a more
severe defect in CPE development and virus produc-
tion than the H-i1SA mutant. In the chimeric virus, the
fused Lulll-H-1 NS1 probably functions less effectively
and the virus is more dependent on NS2. Of more inter-
est, the mutant H-1SAwas incapable of normal produc-
te infection in rat fibroblast cel lines, suggesting that
NS2 is essential only in certain cells. Arecent report on
MVM NS2 mutants in which cell-type specitic defects
in viral replication were described is in agreement with
Our data (Naeger ef al, 1990).

The defect in the NS2 null mutant virus production
appeared more severe in rat cells than in human and
hamster cells (Table 1}, but we were unable to con-
clude that the requirement for NS2 is species or tissue
type-specific from our in vino experiments. H-1 SA repli-
Cates in some rat cells and in some fibrobiasts, for
example, in the rat hephroma ceil line, RN, and in a
ivansiormed human fibroblast cell line MRC.5 V2 {Ta-
ble 1). Considering that most of the cell lines we used
were transformed or tumor derived, which may affect
viral gene expression, we used animal models to verify
the role of NS2 in vivo. Here we took advantage of the
ability of the H-1 virus to cause 8 lethal infection in
newborn hamsters (Toolan, 1960) and in ceran
Strains of newborn rats (Moore and Nicastri, 1965). We
found that newborn Syrian hamsters and Wistar rats
were both killed by wild-type H-1, but the baby rats
Survived the infection by NS2 mutant virus H-1SA (Fig,
11). This indicates that NS2 is required for the infection
and pathogenesis of Parvovirus H-1 in its natural host,
but not in an experimental host, such as the Syrian
hamster.

The absence of infectious virus Particles in the NS2
mutant-intected rat liver and spleen tissues could be
due to either the defect in viral SS progeny DNA accu-
mulation or to the lack of capsid assernbly we have
