Synthesis and Virus Production in Rat Cells in Vivo and in Vitro’

Recewved February 14, 1991; accepted May 2. 1991

We generated @ mutation in the gene for the nonstructural protein NS2 of Parvovirus H-1 in which the highly
conserved dinucleotide AG at the 3' splica acceptor site of NS2 intron 1 wes mutated to CG, The mutation does not
change the amino acid sequence for NS?. The splice acceptor (SA} mutant gene was introduced into the H-1 virus
{H-1SA) and an infectious clone of Lulil (pLUH1SA). Tha A2 transcripts encoding NS2 were absent by both Northern
blot and primer extension anelysis in the LuH1SA or H-1SA virus-infacted cells and the NS2 protein was undetectable
in the infected ceil lysate by immunoprecipitation. These NS2 null mutant viruses were capable of lytic growth in cell
lines that were derived from human, hamster, and dog, but they produced lower virus titers than wild-type H-1, The
H.1SA virus nonproductively infected Rat2 rat fibroblasts and transformed Rat? cell lines: Analysis of synchronized
infections of rat fibroblasts demonstrated thet H-1SA viral duplex replicative form ONA replication was reduced and
that single-stranded progeny DNA was deficient compared to wild-type H-1.in addition, H-iSA viral protein synthesis
was about 10% of wild-type virus and virions were nat detectable in rat fibroblasts. However, H-1SA mRNAs R1 and R3
accumulated to wild-type levels. NS2 was also required for productive infection in newborn rats but not in newborn
hamsters. These results indicate that NS2 plays an important role in the regulation of viral protein synthesis in rat cells

INTRODUCTION

Autonomous parvoviruses contain a linear, single-
stranded (SS) DNA genome of about 5 kb. The geno-
mic organization has been found to be identical among
the radent parvoviruses. The viral genome encodes
two overlapping transcription units; the early promoter,
P4, at the left-hand end of the viral genome produces
the transcripts R1 and R2 which synthesize the non-
structural proteins NS1 and NS2, respectively, and the
late promoter, P38, generates the R3 transcripts which
are translated into the viral capsid proteins VP1 and
VP (Cotmore and Tattersall, 1987).

NS1 protein is coded for by a single exon and is
predicted by the sequence to have a motecular weight
of 76 kDa. However, NS1 migrates as several 84- to
88-kDa bands on polyacrylamide gels. The slower mo-
bitty of the B8-kDa form of NS1 is due to phosphoryla-
tion {Rhode and Iversen, 1990: Iversen and Rhode,
1990; Paradiso, 1984). NS1 accumulates in the nu-
cleus and it is essential for viral DNA replication (Berns
etal, 1988; Rhode, 1989; Tratschin ef a/., 1984: Li and
Rhode, 1990), P4 and P38 promoter regulation (Labow
etal, 1986; Rhode, 1985; Rhode, 1987b; Tratschin et

19872; Li and Rhode, 1990).

NS2 is a much smaller protein with only 188 amino
acids in parvovirus H-1 and migrates at 25-28 kDa on
polyacrylamide gels. NS2 protein of minute virus of
mice (MVM) has three isoforms (Morgan and Ward,
1986; Jongeneel ef af, 1986; Clamens er a/., 1990;
Cotmore and Tattersall, 1990) and H-1 should have at
least two. The major one is encoded by three exons
with a large intron and 4 smail intron removed during
the splicing process. Exon 1 of NS2 shares the sarne
Start codon at nucleotide 264 with the NS1 gene, thus
NS2 and NS1 have an identical 84 amino acids at their
amino terminus; exon 2, located at the carboxyl-ter-
minus of the NS 1 gene. is translated in a different read-
ing frame from NS1; exon 3 encodes only 6 amino
acids. The minor isoform of NS2 is produced by using
an alternative splice donor and acceptor site for intron
2. Translation terminates betore its splice donor site,
therefore its exon 2 is 6 amino acids longer than the
major form of NS2 and there is no translated exon 3.
Thus, the two isoforms of NS2 differ only by the 6
amino acids at their carboxyl-terminal end (Rhode and
Iversen, 1990; Iversen and Rhode, 1990) (Fig. 1).

The function of NS2 has not been well defined. Since
NS1 is essential to virus replication, it is difficult to sap-
arate the gene of NS2 from NS1 and generate muta-
tions in the NS2 gene without affecting the structure of
NS1. To approach this problem, we have successfully
