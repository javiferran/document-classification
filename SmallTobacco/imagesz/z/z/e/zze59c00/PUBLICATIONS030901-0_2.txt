NS2 HELPS REGULATE VIRAL PROTEIN SYNTHESIS V9

1987a). Viruses were collected 10 days postinfection
based on the completion of CPE. The viruses were
further propagated in either the NB324K or the Hak cell
lines and the virus titers were determined in NB324K
cells by either end-point dilution (Reed and Muench,
1938) or plaque assay (Ledinko, 1967).

RNA extraction and Northern blot analysis

Total RNAs were extracted by the method of acid
guanidinium phenol chloroform 20 hr postinfection
(Chamezynski and Sacchi, 1987). RNA samples were
denatured in 1.0 M glyoxal for 60 min at 50°, traction-
ated through 1.4% agarose gel in 10 mM NaPO,, pH
6.5, then transferred onto S&S Nytran nylon mem-
branes by vacuum blotting according to the standard
protocol recommended by the manufacturer (LKB,
Bromma, Sweden). The membrane was hybridized to
P-labeled DNA probes made with random primers
and autoradiographed with Kodak X-Omat AR films.

Primer extension and sequence analysis

Total RNAs were extracted as described above and
a31-mer minus-stranded primer (2097-AAGGCTCTA-
GAGCTAGGTCCGCAAGGTCCGA-3’) was synthe-
sized and used to detect transcripts R2 and R3 of par-
vovirus H-1, The primer extension and electrophoretic
analysis were performed as described (Kingston,
1989).

Protein immunoprecipitation

Cells (5 x 108 per 60-mm dish) were infected and
metabolically labeled for 2 hr from 18 to 20 hr postinfec-
tion with [78S] methionine (NEN, >800 Ci/mmol) at 20-
50 wCi/m! in methionine-free medium. The cells were
lysed and immunoprecipitated as described previously
(Paradiso, 1984}. The NS1 and NS2 proteins were pre-
Cipitated with specific rabbit antisera provided by S. F.
Cotmore (Cotmore and Tattersall, 1986) and the cap-
sid proteins were precipitated with hamster anti-H-1
serum. This serum was pooled from hamsters that sur-
vived neonatal H-1 infection. The immunoprecipitated
proteins were analyzed on 7.5% (NS1 and capsid pro-
teins) or 15% {NS2) polyacrylamide-SDS gels.

Synchronized infection and Southern blot analysis

Synchronization was carried out by using a double-
block procedure as described (Cotmore and Tattersall,
1987). Cells were cultured in the absence of isoleucine
for 48 hr. Following virus infection, cultures were incu-
bated in complete medium containing 20 pM aphidico-
lin for 20 hr. The aphidicolin block was released by
washing the cultures twice with 1X HBSS (Hank's bal-

PUBLICATIONS

anced salts) and replacing the medium with complete
MEM. The viral RF and SS DNAs were collected at
various time points by tha method of Hirt and analyzed
by Southerh blotting as described previously (Rhode,
1989).

Cytotoxicity test by using colorimetric MTT
{tetrazoliurn) assay

The method used was based on the basic protocol
described elsewhere (Mosmann, 1983; Kasugai et a/.,
1990). Briefly, PEJRat2 cells were seeded in 96-well
plates at 1 x 10° cells per well and infected by either
H-1 or H-18A virus. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyithiazol-2-yl)-
2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; Sigma catalog No.
M2128) was dissolved in serum-free medium at 5 mao/
ml (10X) and filtered just before use. At the indicated
time after infection, 20 ul of 10x stock MTT solution
was added to 200 al of medium per well and the plates
were incubated at 37° supplemented with 5% CO, for
2hr. Then, the medium was removed by inverting and
tapping the plates and 200 yl of dimethyl sulfoxide was
added to each well. The plates were read at 540 nm
using an ELISA reader (V,,q, Kinetic Microplate Reader,
Molecular Devices).

Electron microscopy

PEJRaté cells were collected at 20 hr postinfection
and pelleted in microcentrituge tubes. Cet! Pellets were
fixed in picric acid-paratormaidehyde-glutaraidehyde
(PAPG) and postfixed in 1% OsO,. The samples were
further processed and embedded according to a stan-
derd protocol in the Electron Micrascope Lab, Depart.
ment of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Ne-
oraska Medica! Center.

Sucrose gradient sedimentation

PEJRat2 cells were infected with H-1 or H-SA for 17
hr and labeled with [>*S)methionine (NEN, >800 Ci/
mmol) at 50-100 zCi/ml in methionine-free medium tor
an additional 5 hr. The cell nuclei were collected by
centrifugation after treatment with 0.5% NP-40 in
phosphate-butfered saline (PBS) on ice for 5 min and
then lysed in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mA7 EDTA(TE
buffer) with 0.5% sarcosyl. The extract was layered
onto linear & to 40% sucrose gradients in TE and cen-
trituged in 8 Beckman SW50.1 rotor at 20° and 40,000
rpm for 70 min. Fractions of the gradients were col-
lected from the bottom of the tubes and counted by
liquid scintillation spectroscopy.
