described in the text. (A) Wild-type H-1-infected cells. A typical viral inclusion in the nucleus s full of virus partictes. (8) Mutant H- 1SA-infected

tion was proportional to the virus titer {data moat shown),
indicating that little defective virus was made. Electron
microscopy of wild-type H-1-infected rat cells showed
thet the nucleus was rich in full virions and empty virus
particles, especially in the area surrounding and within
viral inclusions (Fig, 5A). In the H-1SA-infected cell nu-
cleus, there were some inclusions which mey have
been derived from the aggregation of viral capsid pro-
teins, but full virions or empty virus particles were not

seen (Fig. 5B). This observation was further confirmed
with an analysis for virions by sucrose gradient sedi-
mentation (Fig. 6). Two peaks were seen in the wild-
type H-1-infected PEJRat2 cell lysate corresponding to
1108S full virus particles (F) and 708 empty virus panrti-
cles (E}, which has also been described for Lull! virus
(Muller and Siegl, 1983). Neither type of viral particle
was detected in the H-1SA-infected call lysate. Pooled
fractions of the two virion peaks of wild-type H-1 were
