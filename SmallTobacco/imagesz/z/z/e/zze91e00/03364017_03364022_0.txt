SUBJECT: Revised Project Schedules

Mr. Judge recently directed us to alter the timing on three
projects: (1) True 100's tar reduction, (2) KGL 100's .
tar reduction, and (3) Aspen. We have revised the project
schedules to accomodate his requests and the following

paragraphs will summarize the revised schedule and their

impact on the remaining projects.

I. TRUE 100'S TAR REDUCTION

According to our prior schedule, this project would have
been completed by 1-1-79 except for Market Research
which was not scheduled. Mr. Judge has directed

that we be in market on 1-1-79. We have one can-

didate (same taste) ready and will select another
candidate (True 5 taste) for Market Research. The
revised schedule follows:

(1) Make MRD samples 9 October 1978
(2) “Ship MRD samples 20 October 1978
(3) Samples arrive in N.Y. 23 October 1978
(4) Top Line results 20 November 1978
(5) Test Mkt. Prod. Start 27 November 1978
(6) Test Market Sales 2 January 1979

In order to meet the schedule, we must have all approved
artwork in hand and order all materials (tipping, labels,
etc.) needed on 16 October 1978.

This project was originally budgeted at 2300 man-hours

(of which 1860 were budgeted in 1978) excluding Market

Research sample preparation, evaluation, and production
monitoring. The new schedule allows for 1375 man-hours
in total.
