KGL 100'S TAR REDUCTION

According to our prior schedule, this project would
have been initiated in November, 1978 and 515 man-
hours were assigned for 1978. The total project was
estimated at 3900 man-hours. The schedule has been
altered to include 900 man-hours during 1978, an
additional 500 man-hours for January, 1979 which
will include product preparation for Market Research

and an overall reduction in the project to 1650

man-hours in total. The new schedule follows:

(1) Make MRD samples 22 January 1979
(2) Ship MRD samples 2 February 1979
(3) Samples arrive in N.Y. 5 February 1979
(4) Top-Line results 5 March 1979
(5) Test Mkt. Prod. start 12 March 1979
(6) Test Market Sales 2 April 1979

In order to meet the schedule, we must have all
approved artwork in hand and order all required
materials on 29 January 1979.

ASPEN

No time was budgeted for this project on the oriainal
schedule as samples had previously been consumer tested
successfully. Two things have recently occurred which
require time: (1) Marketing is considering the use

of comparative advertising which requires supporting
data and (2) Marketing has lowered the tar requirement
on the 100 mm version to 9 mg (same as K.S.). We

have therefore altered our schedules to provide time

to make K.S. samples for Market Research and to develop
a 100mm version at 9 mg tar in order to meet the 15
January test market as directed by Mr. Judge. The
schedule follows:

K.S. (1) Make MRD samples 25 September 1978
(2) Ship MRD samples 6 October 1978
(3) Samples arrive in N.Y. 9 October 1978
(4) Top-line results 6 November 1978
(5) Test Mkt. Prod. Start 13 November 1978
(6) Test Market Sales 15 January 1979
100 mm (1) Test Mkt. Prod. Start 4 December 1978
(2) Test Market sales 15 January 1979
