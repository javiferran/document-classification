burley and flue-cured belts will be eliminated.
Studies regarding utilization of off-shore tobacco/
cost reducers will be delayed.

(2) Research - Delays will occur in projects such as
RL improvement, synthetic flavor development and
other areas requiring sample evaluations and pre-
paration.

(3) Market Research - No time will be available during
1978 for tests such as OGF, CORPORATE II and
BASIC.

IV. Although we have budgeted considerable time for EFI and
KENT III production monitoring, due to the complexities
of the products, these projects and others may necessitate
our borrowing people from other groups to help.
