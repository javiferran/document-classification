We have budgeted 850 man-hours in 1978 to meet
this schedule. Also, we must have all approved
artwork in hand and order all materials required
on 2 October 1978.

IV. EFII

At the last P.D.C. meeting, the group was advised
that preliminary samples could be ready for a
Market Research test in October - the results of
which should provide guidance in completing the
project. We have altered the schedule to field
this test this year as follows:

(1) Make MRD samples 23 October 1978

(2) Ship MRD samples 3 November 1978

(3) Samples arrive in N.Y. 6 November 1978

(4) Top-Line results 1 December 1978
DISCUSSION

The reduction in man-hours for the TRUE 100 and KGL 100

projects was necessary to meet the test market dates. In
other words, we have utilized the man-hours available this
year and apportioned them among the projects. From a

practical standpoint, we believe we have reduced our

chances of having completely successful products in hand

on the required dates. The decreased time allocations

Mean we can â€˜make fewer samples than originally scheduled.

In summary, if each step of each project is successful, we
can have products available; however we are not confident
that these will be as good as products made according to the
Original schedule.

These changes in priority will impact in several areas:

I. We have to purchase materials without supportina data,

Il. We have to assume each step will be successful, e. gq.
We'll start test market production with only top- line
consumer test results in hand.

III. We'll have to use time allocated to other projects, e.a.
(a) No work is now scheduled for NFS during September
and October.

(b) Our previous schedule utilized 75% of the available

Product Development man-hours; the remaining hours would

have been used in several areas which will now be

temporarily halted. Examples of these follow:

(1) Leaf Department - Only urgent requests will be worked
in. Training for P.D. personnel on this year's
