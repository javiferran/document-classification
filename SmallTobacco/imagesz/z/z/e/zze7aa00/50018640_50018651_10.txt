radiation which would photolyze nitrogen dioxide about half as fast as bright sunshine.
When the interior of the cell was lined with aluminum foil, photolysis was faster than in
sunlight. Originally these lamps were mounted along either side of the cell. It was found,
however, that schlieren effects from the warm lamp surfaces caused intolerable fluctuations
in the infrared beam. When the lamps were moved upward 45° around the cell body this
problem was completely eliminated.

Surface effects have not been a serious problem with these cells. Non-polar and unreactive
materials such as aldehydes, alcohols, hydrocarbons, etc. will stay in the cell indefinitely.

Acrolein, for example, was left over night in the cell at a concentration of 10 p.p.m. in air
with no detectable loss. Under the best circumstances small concentrations of ozone are
also stable in the cell. More polar and more reactive substances such as organic acids are
subject to adsorption and desorption on the surfaces however.

Acknowledgements—Several members of the Chemical Kinetics and Spectroscopy Section of the Franklin
Institue Laboratories made important contributions to the design and construction of the long-path cells.
These include Rachel Franklin, Luther Conant, Louis Herczeg, and Richard Cavaliere. Edwin Bailey of the
Astronemy Department of the Franklin Institute made the mirrors.
