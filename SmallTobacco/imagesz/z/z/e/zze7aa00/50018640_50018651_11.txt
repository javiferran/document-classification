APPENDIX

Following is the derivation of the formula for determining how large the beam on the large mirrors must
be in order to just fill the spectrometer aperture.

Refer to Fig. 7, and let
H = height (or width) of beam on large mirror inside cell

R = distance between internal mirrors (or image J at edge of mirror)

kL = slit height (or width)

L = image of slit

AM = magnification U/L = M)

M, = parabolic mirror height (or width)

P,, Py = prism height (or width)

zZ = distance from parabolic mirror M, to prism, P,, plus twice the distance from the prism to the

Littrow mirror; i.e., M,P.
F = focal length of monochromator parabolic mirror M,
RY distance from monochromator slit to external mirror (A = height of mirror)
a separation of central ray and extreme ray on My,
(For convenience and clarity, only one half the system has been shown in the figure, showing an extreme

ray and a central ray.)
Draw a line parallel to the optic axis through the end of the image J from H to A. Then
