Long-path infrared spectroscopy for air pollution research 19]

The size of the beam could have been further reduced either by making the distance, S,
larger or by choosing a larger magnification, but the former would have made the external
optics unwieldy and the latter would have made the images inside the cell excessively large.
If the images are made too large the number required may not fit on the small mirror.
When this happens. the demagnified image may not be wide enough to cover the wide
entrance slits needed for sufficient energy at the longer paths. The size of the small mirror
cannot be increased without limit since this would lead to excessive aberration in the
images formed far from the centers of curvature of the large mirrors.

Fic. 3. Size of beam to fill prism

An alternative method of controlling the size of the beam inside the cell has been adopted
for some of the double beam cells which have since been placed on the market. This involves
placing field lenses just outside the entrance and exit images to focus the external mirror
on the large internal mirror. These lenses are made of salt and serve also as entrance and
exit windows for the cell.

An interesting feature of this optical system is illustrated in Fig. 1(@) where four passes
of the beam through the cell are traced. The dotted lines show the extreme rays which will
be accepted by the spectrometer. When these are traced back to the source it is found that
a larger spherical mirror is required on the source side of the cell than on the mono-
chromator side. This disparity is appreciable although not as great as indicated in the
diagram.

OPTIMUM PERFORMANCE

An analysis of the multiple reflection cell shows that for the best signal-to-noise ratio,
the path-length should not be increased beyond a certain optimum value. If reflection losses
reduce the energy by one-half when the path is increased from 50 to 100 m they will also
reduce the energy by the same fraction when the path is increased from 500 to 550 m, but
in the first case the path-length is doubled while in the second it is increased by only 10
