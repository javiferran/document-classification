MEMORANDUM
7/13/95
TO: M. Borsini
FROM: K. Paitakis
SUBJECT: Style Special POS Pricing - Texas Test Market

The following is a list of cost estimates for the Vinyl Decal and 3 piece Mobile which we are

considering for the Texas test market. I have also received projected quantities from Sales
Planning as listed below.

The costs are as follows:

Item Quantity Cost Per Unit Total Cost
10 1/2" Vinyl Decal 6,600 $7.25 $47,850
3 Piece Mobile 6,000 $5.38 $32,280

The cost per unit listed above is based on a quantity of 2,500. Therefore, the actual cost per
unit will probably be slightly lower.

As you are aware, mechanicals for the decal, mobile and dummy pack are currently being

developed by Bob DeBlasio. Receipt of the decal and mobile mechanicals are expected by
July, 24, 1995.

Please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions!
