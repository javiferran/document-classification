Attention: Mr. Robert B. Walker.
Chairman of the Board

Gentlemen:

I doubt if this letter will get to the Chairman of the
Board, but anyway, I am a stockholder in the American Tobacco
Company and received your communication of October 25th, and I
frankly think the tobacco industry is hiding behind a log. As
. long as Kennedys can keep this as a whipping boy, they will: con-
tinue to do so, and of course, it is purely for their personal
. gain and not the public.

I have wondered why the tobacco industry has not asked
the Government why not label whiskey as dangerous to your health,
paregoric which can be bought at any drug fountain in small quan-
tities, and many other household items such as aspirin, etc. I
have wondered why the tobacco industry did not get the producers
association and different farm organizations busy on this, because ,
it is not going to end until someone makes it politically unprofit-—
able for the food and drug administration and Kennedys to make an —
issue of it.

I have practiced law since 1933, have had a lot of deal-
ings with the medical profession, and how in the Hell ¢hey can say
that tobacco causes cancer, when they do not know what cencer is,
is beyond me, but at any rate, it is a popular subject. I remember
twenty years ago, when 1f a person had a bellyache he was automatic-
ally operated on for appendicitis, and that fad has blown over with
the medical profession. Also the tonsillectomy for all children
has blown over. I well remember when the nedical profession sa
that Blue Cross would destroy the nation, and now they are the -
greatest believer in it, and it has enhanced their earnings. Also
