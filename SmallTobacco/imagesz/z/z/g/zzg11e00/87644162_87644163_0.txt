SUBJECT: Vapor Phase Analysis on Recently Submitted Samples

The organic vapor phase, HCN, and permanent gas analysis
are complete for Fact, 4092, 4093, MAX, L. T. Brown, and
Saratoga. Fact is a 85 mm cigarette being test marketed: by
Brown and Williamson. The cigarette has a specially constructed
filter containing a smoke filtering resin{ probably Duolite A~-2,
manufactured by Diamond Shamrock). Samples 4092 and 4093 are
the prototype of the Kent Golden Lights. The remaining samples
are commercially available cigarettes. The results of this
study are given in the attached table...

The only parameter that is substantially different for
Fact, as compared to other 85 mm cigarettes, is HCN. The.
resinous filter additive apparently removes approximately
50 percent of the HCN. :

The permanent gas analysis indicates approximately 40 percent
air dilution for Samples 4092 and 4093. Undoubtedly, 4092 and
4093 should have very low tar and nicotine levels.

The striking similarity in the organic vapor phase for
85 mm and 120 mm cigarettes is probably due to a fortuitous
combination of circumstances, such as similar tobacco weights,
longer burn time, and more air dilution for 120 mm cigarettes.
The affect of air dilution for 120 mm cigarettes becomes very
apparent in the comparison of CO/Ng and CO2/N2 ratios from the
permanent gas data.
