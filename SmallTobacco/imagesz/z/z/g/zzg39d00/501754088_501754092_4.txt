* While the RSM results indicate that a paper porosity of 15
seconds would not achieve preference results as good as 13,4
seconds, we are recommending a 15 second paper porosity be
used only because we have been informed by Tobacco Development
that the 13.4 second paper is not commercially available. Product
43 is currently being tested through M/A/R/C with the 15 second

paper porosity.
