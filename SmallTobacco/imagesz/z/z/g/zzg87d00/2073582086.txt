Penske stages sweep

By Tim Puet 5: 52

Associated Press Writer

LEXINGTON, Ohio — Ai Unser Jr.
led a Team Penske sweep of the first
three positions in Sunday's Miller Genu-
ine Draft 200, which turned on a stop-
and-go penalty against his teammate
Paul Tracy.

The third Penske team member, Em-
erson Fittipaldi, who won here in 1992

@ Miller 200

and last year, was third. Robby Gordon
finished fourth and Michael Andretti
ifth,

Tracy, who had led all but one lap,
was penalized by CART officials for
passing Gordon under a yellow caution
flag on lap 53. The penalty forced Tracy
to make an extra pit stop, then immedi-
ately return to the race course.

The pass occurred on the second turn
of the track in a narrow area known as
the keyhole. Teo Fabi, driving for the
Midiand-based Hall Racing Team had
stalled his car and was off the course
with a tow truck blocking part of the
racing surface.

Tracy’s brakes apparently locked
when he tried to slow down. So did the
brakes on Gordon’s car, which slid side-
ways, allowing Tracy to get past him
along the inside of the track. Gordon
quickly recovered and got back into the
racing line in front of Unser.

“T wasn't planning on passing him,
but he locked up his brakes and almost
slid off the track, What am I supposed
to do? He slipped wide,’' Tracy said of
Gordon.

Tracy said that he tried to talk with
CART officials, “but they didn’t want to
hear anything about it.”

regular pit stop on the 57th lap, when
Unser took first place. Unser pitted one
lap later, and Tracy made his penalty
stop at the same time, allowing Unser
to hold a seven-second lead.

Tracy, who qualified second, slipped
past Unser on the first lap and, until the
penalty, lost the lead only when he pit-
ted on the 29th. Fittipaldi took first at
that point, but pitted on the next lap to
put Tracy back in front.

 

Tt was Unser’s sixth victory in the 11”

Indy-car races this season and his
fourth from the pole position, with the
others coming al the Indianapolis 500
and the Portland and Cleveland road
races, It also was his first triumph in 42
tries at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car course.

In addition, it was the eighth triumph
for the IImor engines of Team Penske.
Tracy and Fittipaldi have won once
apiece,

Unser averaged 110.387 mph for 83
laps, or 185.8 miles over the 2%-mile, 13-
turn road course. The race originally
was scheduled for 89 laps, but was
shortened to meet ABC-TV require-
ments, CART spokesman Dave Etshoff
said.
