RE: Event Sponsorship - "Johnny Canales Show" - Concert

BACKGROUND

On Sunday, October 22, 1989 the taping of the Johnny Canales show will be
open to the public in Corpus Christi. Johnny Canales is the Tejano version
of Johnny Carson who has a live entertainment show over all Univision
stations featuring Tejano apfists. His show has a massive grass roots
appeal and his audience is (Fthnetery our target market.

The proceeds from those attending will go to benefit the local Boys and

Girls Clubs. Estimated attendance is 10,000. Although the show will be taped
for a later airing date, there is no problem with our participation. We

did the same type of event here in Houston in June to benefit the National
Hispanic Scholarship Fund, and it was very successful.

RECOMMENDATION
I am recommending participation in this event.
RATIONALE

Participation in this event will provide the Camel Brand with extensive
exposure in Corpus Christi's Hispanic market in a relatively slow promotional
period. In addition, participation in this event will provide the brand with
an opportunity to:

Sample our target market

Distribute our premiums

Display our banners and inflatables

Set up our Camel Video Van - show our videos
Include our logo in print publicity

eH eH

This will also provide us with a good event for this market which has not
been to active in promotional events.
