Research

Contract requires an audience composition study done in November of each
year. The results of this research impact on a cancellation option.
Research must show that Moviegoer delivers 50% of audience against 18-29
adults and 50% male readers. Research to date showed results that
exceeded these levels. This research was not conducted in November 1983
based on agreement with RJR management that it was not necessary. Funds
for this research ($50M) are being credited to RJR. We will be
initiating 1984 field research to be conducted in July-August.

Subscription Test

As originally planned, 13-30 was to test subscriptions to Moviegoer
as self-liquidating circulation growth. Based on their current
knowledge of the subscription market, their position is that,
subscriptions to Moviegoer would be very expensive to maintain and
that this does not represent an efficient circulation potential.

Cost of 1985 Program

Projected cost for 1985 is $6,808,000 which represents a 7.64: increase
over 1984. This incorporates an increase of internal costs (edit,
field and account services) of 10% vs. the 12.5% permitted in the
contract. Also included in the projected cost is 13-30's gross

margin of 17.65% which is permitted by the contract.

Fees to Theatres

Fees to theatres of 2¢ a copy for distribution plus storage fees are
on budget. .

Summary

13-30 is doing an adequate job of distributing and servicing Moviegoer.
Based on performance to date, we do not have any basis to cancél the
program.

Attached is a copy of the 13-30 agenda and summary exhibits from the
March 16 meeting. Also attached is a copy of our February 28 letter.
