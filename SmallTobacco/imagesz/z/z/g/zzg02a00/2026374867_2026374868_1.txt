of Irby, et al.; this is because each actually represents a
broad spectrum of materials, some of which fall into our
classification of weak adsorbents and some which do not.

I hope it will not be necessary for us to fall back to
claims to primary weak adsorbents or to carbon blacks, but

this approach might be considered.
