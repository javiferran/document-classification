rated microscopic work by pathologists to identify the
types of cancerg involved. Dr. Linda C. Koo at tha Uni-
versity of Hong Kong has headed a series of research ef-
forts that have combined the work of a pathologist to
identify cancers with strict controls to separate the ef
fecte of other variables such as age and diet.14 gy the
words of one independent reviewer, "the information on the
patients and controls [in the Koo studies] is more de-
tailed than in all other studies."15

The research by Dr. Koo and her colleagues led
to several conclusions. Most important, it determined
that when problems of misdiagnosis and independent vari-
ables Were removed, ETS exposure in the home and at work
had no statistically significant impact on the incidences
ef lung cancer.

The Hong Kong etudy also dramatically under-
scored the significance of the failure of Many other stud-
ies to isolate variables associated with socic-economic
status, The research showed that the wives of snokers
were typically less wealthy and had lass "healthy"
lifestyles, including diets consisting of more processed
foods and fewer fresh fruite and vegetables. Dr. Koo con-
cluded that these correlates -- when not isolated --
played an important role in confounding research re-
sults, 16

fication research. & team of researchers headed by Dr.
