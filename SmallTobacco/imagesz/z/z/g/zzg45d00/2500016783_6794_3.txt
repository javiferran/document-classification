ship to smoking. Thus, if a scientific study fails to
distinguish between primary and secondary lung sancers, it
may falgely overestimate the number of cancer incidents
possibly linked to smoking.

In practical application, this problem recurs in
two common situations. First, some studies have relied
only on hospital records or death certificates that have
listed a patient as having had lung cancer, without
identifying whether the patient had primary or secondary
lung cancer, Such a determination requires a skilled re-
view of slides of the cancer celle themselves. Without
this expertise and analysis, it is very difficult to de~
termine the precise type of cancer involved.®

Second, the problem of misdiagnosis is particu-
larly important when analyzing the possible effects of ETS
on women. Women sometimes are afflicted with breast or
ovarian cancer that spreads to the lung. Unless a careful
effort is made te identify the original source,
epidemiological studies will not accurately identify the
type of cancer involved.? ‘this problem ie particularly
important in this context because many studies on ETS have
evaluated the effects of ETS on nonsmoking women married
to smokers.

o Fa isolate dables. A second
broad problem in ETS studies is the failure to ensure that

observed effects may be explained only by ETS. In all re-

search on ETS, a scientist must control carefully for all
other variables in order to focus on ETS and not some

other factor. Most epidemiological studies have focused
