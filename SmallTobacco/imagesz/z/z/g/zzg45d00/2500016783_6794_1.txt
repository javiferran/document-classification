conclusion is that the supposed link between ETS and lung

cancer remains unproven,

oO} Expo. bace. ?

Two basic issues must be considered when evalu-
ating the potential risks of ETS. â€˜The first has to do
with how much exposure nonsmokers really have to ETS. The
second concerns the statistical studies that hava been
performed to determine whether certain groups of nonsmok-
ers have higher rates of lung cancer simply because they
have lived or worked with nonsmokers.

The first issue invelves efforts to estimate the
amount of tebacco smoke to which a typical nonsmoker is
exposed, compared to the amount that is inhaled by activa
smokers. Scientists have conducted ceveral such studies,
which show that the exposure of nonsmokers to ETS is mini~
mal. For example, on average a nonsmoker is exposed to no
more than one-quarter of one percent of the smoke inhaled
by an active smoker.? In terms of the particulate matter
retained by nonsmokers, the amount is even lower: recent
studies have estimated that the average nonsmoker retains
oly one-fifth of one percent of the particulate matter
retained by active smokers.4

Faced with these facts, smoking opponante have
responded with the assertion that ETS is somehow more
toxic than the smoke inhaled directly by smokers. They

Claim that the smoke from the burning end of a cigarette -
