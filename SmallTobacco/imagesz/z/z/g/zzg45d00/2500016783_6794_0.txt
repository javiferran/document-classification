Environmental Tobacee smoke
and Its Relationship to Lung Cancer

Public debate recently has focused on the ef-
feote of amoking on nonsmokers. Those who argue for
widespread bans on smoking sometimes claim that nonsmokers
can suffer lung cancer as the result of exposure to envi-
ronmental tobacco smoke ("ETS"), which is the smoke that
enters the air either from the end of the burning
cigarette or when exhaled by smokers. Scientific re-
search, however, has failed to support this claim. To the
contrary, as the American Cancer Society recently recog-
nized, "the currently available evidence is not sufficient
to conclude that passive or involuntary smoking causes
lung cancer in nenemokers * * * xo

The Cancer Society reached its conclusion de~-
spite the fact that some studies have suggested that expo+
sure to ETS can increase a nonsmoker’s risk of contracting
lung cancer by 35 to 40 percent, * Implicit in the Cancer
Study’s conclusion is the recognition that there exist
strong reasons to doubt the validity of these estimates.
Among other things, the pertinent studies frequently have
igno fundamental maxims of scientific research, reach-
ing conclusions without taking account of all the factors

that may contribute to the development of a disease such

eg.glo0os2

as lung cancer. As th.3 paper discusses below, when ail

the relevant factors are taken into account, the only fair
