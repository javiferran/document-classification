for each patient a series of medical slides of actual can-
cer cells. This review showed that overall there wag no
statistically significant inereage in the risk of lung
cancer for nonsmoking women married to smokers. Indeed,
ETS caused even a marginally significant risk increase for
only one subgroup — wonen married to men who smoke more
than 20 cigarettes par day. 17

These two studies cast substantial doubt on the
validity of the 1931 research that sparked the Ongolng de-
bate on the effects of ETS. In a 1987 artidie, a German
scientist reviewed all of the research conducted since
1981 and concluded that "the major trend of the evidence"
does not support the hypothesis that exposure to ETS
causes lung cancer, 18 Indeed, the article noted that "all
studies with positive associations (between ETS and lung
cancer] can just as well be explained by chance, bias,

confounding or misclassification, "19

At present, it is simply not fair to conclude
that exposure to ETS increases the risk of lung cancer
among nonsmokers. Advocates of such a condlusion typi-
Cally rely on incomplete or inadequate research, while ig-
noring both the immediate dilution of sidestream smoke and
the more recent (and more thorough) scientific studies
that have found no statistically significant velationship
between ETS and lung cancer. 7
Scientific research on ETS should continue.

There is still room for improvement in rasearch tech-—
