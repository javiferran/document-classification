maintains a schedule of all ads carried in daily and weekly newspapers,

comic sections, Sunday newspaper supplements, national magazines, farm
and trade journals, college magazines, and football programs. Complete
information is kept also on the size, location, and cost of all outdoor signs
and billposters, Railway Express truck posters, and bus and subway car
cards.

Before any part of an advertising program is undertaken, William
Esty Company submits a detailed estimate of the cost of the plan for ap-
proval by the Advertising Committee. As each part of the program gets
under way, the agency submits bills for its services, which the Advertising
Department must check in detail and approve for payment.

The Advertising Department does not attempt to do such creative work
as preparing artwork, selecting models, laying out ads, and writing radio
and television commercial scripts. That type of work is done by the agency,
which employs specialists in such fields. However, all magazine and news-
paper ads, all poster material, and all radio and TV commercial announce-
ments are carefully studied by the advertising group here, and revisions
are often suggested before the material is released.

We mentioned that the Advertising Department is responsible for keep-
ing our Sales Representatives supplied with advertising and merchandising
materials. These materials are placed by the Company’s Salesmen in and
around stores where its products are sold. They include window pasters
and posters, cutouts, calendars, change trays, metal signs, decals, and
cigarette carton and package racks. Their purpose is to remind shoppers
to buy your Company’s products and to make CAMELS and CAVALIERS, in
particular, easier to see and reach. Of course the Sales Department plays

a large part in the selection and design of these ‘‘point-of-sale’’ materials.
