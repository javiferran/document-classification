program of national advertising is ‘absolutely necessary for the greatest

sales success of even the best product, particularly in a highly competitive
business like the tobacco industry.

We might mention that because this Company invests large sums of
money in advertising, many people think that advertising makes up a large
part of the cost of a pack of cigarettes. You will be interested to know that
the cost of advertising CAMELS amounts to an average of only about 1/3

The policies to be followed in our national advertising program are
decided by an Advertising Committee. This Committee is currently com-
posed of: Mr. Bowman Gray, Vice President and Sales Manager (Chairman);
Mr. E. A. Darr, President; Mr. W. T. Smither, Manager Advertising Depart-
ment; and Mr. J. T. Barnes, dr., and Mr. F. G. Carter, Assistant Sales
Managers. | oe |

To help carry out its vast advertising program the Company employs
the services of an advertising agency. Since 1932 the agency has been
William Esty Company, Inc., of New York City. As Secretary of the
Advertising Committee and Manager of the Advertising Department, Mr.
Smither, with the help of his Department, is responsible for working closely
with the agency to see that the approved advertising plans are properly
carried out.

Keeping a close check on the Company’s national advertising program
is a big job. This checking is under the able direction of Mr. Clarence L.
Johnson. Records must be kept of all contracts and costs relating to the
Company’s radio and television shows. Accurate lists are kept of the
various stations which carry network programs and spot announcements,

including their times of broadcast and rate charges. The Department
