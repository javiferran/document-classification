Dear Dr. Senkus:

Thank you for your letter of February 17, 1969, on the
topic of the Reference Cigarette.

Further to my memorandum of January 30, I discussed the
Reference Cigarette with Dr. Stokes, by telephone, yesterday.
It is now apparent that the formula for the Reference
Cigarette, which is to be designated Code 1R1, is to remain
constant and is not intended to mimic the average of American
blends as they change or may change from year-to-year.

Dr. Stokes regarded my dissertation on the Reference Cigarette
(minutes of the fourth meeting--final paragraph on page 8,

all of the paragraphs on page 9, and down to line 16 of

page 10) as accurately representing the situation as it

exists today. ,

Yours sincerely,
Lb flaucheel
