We expect to sign an agreement shortly for IS’s Project Toolbox, which relates to the
procurement and roll-out of computer equipment and software for all the Territory Sales Managers.

We have drafted and negotiated a number of other IS-related agreements with vendors
such as IBM, Towers-Perrin, The Hackett Group, Sun Microsystems and Seimens.
