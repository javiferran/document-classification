FDA

Hundreds of hours have been spent meeting with the impacted client groups in an
effort to explain/ interpret the FDA regulations, and in helping to develop an
implementation/ compliance plan. There have also been numerous communications with our co-
plaintiffs in the North Carolina litigation and with the FDA covering questions of interpretation and
issues of extensions.

the department. We gave advice regarding various mobilizations efforts on the local and state level.

EMPLOYMENT - we -

We advised Operations and Human Resources Management on a number of
employment-related issues, including hiring, discharge and reorganization matters. Specifically, we
have advised or are advising on (1) potential adverse impact issues raised by selection systems for
hiring; (2) an EEOC charge relating to Cabarrus’ selection system for maintenance technicians and an
extensive document production related to that charge; (3) a race discrimination lawsuit filed by a
Cabarrus employee; and (4) several misconduct investigations and discipline.

INFORMATION SERVICES
