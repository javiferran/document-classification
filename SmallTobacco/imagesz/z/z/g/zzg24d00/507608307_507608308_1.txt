cigarette tax increase was approved by the Senate Finance
Committee last week. The state faces a serious revenue shortfall,
and there is at least some danger that the issue may be
reconsidered during House deliberations on a tax package.

Governor Arne Carlson of Minnesota proposed a 24c/ increase in the
state’s cigarette excise tax (from 38c/ to 62c/ per pack) in his
budget proposals submitted to the legislature on February 20. The
cigarette excise tax increase was one of several tax measures
proposed by the Governor to eliminate a portion of the state’s
$1.2 billion budget deficit. If approved by the legislature,
Minnesota would have by far the highest state cigarette excise tax
in the nation. A comprehensive RJRT and industry plan to oppose
the proposal is being executed, which includes strong "grass
roots" lobbying activities being conducted by RJRT’s Public Issues
Department.

Committee hearings have begun in Pennsylvania on the Governor’s
proposal to increase the cigarette excise tax by 30c/ a pack (from
18c/ to 48c/ per pack). The House Finance Committee heard testimony
February 19 on the cigarette tax and other tax increases proposed

by Governor Robert Casey. Significantly, Committee Chairman Fred
Trello announced at the hearings that he was opposed to the 30c/
cigarette tax increase. Strong RJRT and industry efforts in
opposition to the Governor’s proposal are continuing.

Ballot Initiatives

A coalition of health organizations in Massachusetts is actively
seeking support from various sources to place a cigarette excise
tax initiative on the 1992 general election ballot. The proposal
being discussed is similar to Prop. 99 approved by California
voters in 1988; it would mandate a 25c/ increase in the cigarette
excise tax (from 26c/ to 5lc/ per pack), with the revenue earmarked
to fund counter-advertising and other anti-tobacco “educational"
programs. The effort is being closely monitored by RUJRT- andthe
