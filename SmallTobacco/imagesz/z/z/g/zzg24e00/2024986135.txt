Subject: - Reguliation of Cigarettes by the Food and Drug Administration

You may remember that in May 1977 ASH petitioned
the Food. and Drug Administration to regulate cigarettes
as drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic: Act.
The FDA denied! the petition andi its decision was upheld
by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in
1979.

ASH appealed. that. decision to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The attached
memorandum to: the: Committee of Counsel from Covington &
Burling describes. the oral arguments before the Court of

Appeals on May 13.

Two related actions by ASH are pending. One seeks
to: have the FDA regulate cigarettes as medical devices
because they dispense nicotine: and the other asks the FDA.
to. find that cigarette filters are medical devices. The
attached articlle from the May 19 issue of the Legal Times of
Washington describes all three: of the: pending, cases.

The progress of these: cases is being closely
monitored by the Committee of Counsel through Covington. &
Burling. .
