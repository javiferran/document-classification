Re: Hecht and Hoffmann letter draft

Dear Richard,

Following some suggestion from Hans-Juergen Haussmann, HER and others, | have
made a few minor corrections to the attached draft. However, | have also had to make
a major change in the dose/expesure calculation for NNK. Having identtiied the study
cited by H&H to be Belinsky ef a/. (1990), the corrected PY estimate now reads 720 PY
instead of the 1,860 PY previously stated. All corrections are underlined.

Best regards,
Th
