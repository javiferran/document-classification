RE: Additional Benzo[a]pyrene Analysis on Acetonitrile Fractions

These fractions were examined in the same manner 8s the previously
reported ones. — -

Fraction 61 showed no band at the benzo[a]pyrene Re.

Fraction 73 was analyzed for benzo[a]pyrene, and we found
1715 yg. in the 4.35 ml. sample remaining from the original 5 ml. of
tar sample. This would mean a total of 1971 yg. in this fraction, of
which 256 Hg. was submitted for painting.

Fraction 75 contained a total of 838 yg. in the original 5 ml.
sample, and 109 ug. was submitted for painting. The original sample
weight was 62.2 mg. -

The following table gives a ‘synopsis of -fractions- examined thus
