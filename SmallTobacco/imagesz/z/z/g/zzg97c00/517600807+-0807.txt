Re: 1985 Performance Plan Summary

In order to assist me with preparation of the 1985
Performance Plan Summary, please prepare a list in short concise
statements of your accomplishments during 1985. A few examples

are shown below:

*

An environmental smoke test chamber with appropriate
control of temperature, humidity, air flows, lighting, and
air leakage has been successfully constructed and is in
operation.

Studies of environmental smoke with various analytical
methods and instrumentation have clearly demonstrated that
the nicotine is found in the vapor phase of the aerosol.

An innovative UV absorption method has been developed to
measure the levels of ETS collected on chamber surfaces.

Denuder tube technology has been developed to aid in the
understanding of vapor-particulate partitioning in ETS.

An improved mass spectral search library specific for
sidestream bases has been developed.

Please reply by October 18. Cay

Thanks for you assistance.
