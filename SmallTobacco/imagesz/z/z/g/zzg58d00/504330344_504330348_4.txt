System For Allocation of Founding Members’ Contributions

Board members are asked to consider whether or not it would
be appropriate for all INFOTAB expenses - Secretarizt and
projects - to be paid by founding member contributions on a
pro-rata basis, using the same formula now appliec to cover
progrem/project budgets. A somewhat similar system - hased
on market shares - is applied in a number of NMASs;

The staffing of the Secretariat and development of its
services have increasec Secretariat expenses considerably
in relation to project costs, since the interim and stari-
up periods when the present method to calculate
ccntributions was agreed.

It will be appreciated if member companies will give their
reply to this proposal to the Secretary General by mid-
summer, so that, if agreed by alli, the turnover ficures can
be up@ated (via Arthur Anderson) and allocations calculated
for the 1983 budget to be presented at the November Board
meeting.
