Please place ID tags on the springload cartridge push plates and not on the front glass
when setting up plan-o-grams. Note that Revco has the capability to make
identification tags by brand style through their computer system at store level. This
should eliminate our concerns regarding furnishing them with competitive ID tags.

Based on my letter of April 29, 1994, which is self-explanatory, please follow guidelines
for P-O-G'ing package and cartons. Please utilize the enclosed POG as your guide.

To qualify Revco for utilization of springload cartridge kits on their shelving, we have
developed a special valence insert price kit for placement into their valence, directly
above the cigarette packages. Please note this kit includes a carton logo, which should
be placed to the left, and a Camel logo that should be placed to the right of the pricing
inserts. Instructions are listed in each kit for placement.

Please assure that you as you face the backbar, you start by placing Generic King first,
then Generic 100's, Value Price King, Value Price 100's, Branded Kings, and Branded
100's, going left to right. Also note that four (4) numerical strips for each print point
(24 total) are included so that future price changes can be done at store level by their
management personnel. Utilize all strips, four (4) per brand category.

Please assure as soon as the cartridges arrive at store level, that we make arrange-
ments with store for installation to insure we meet Revco's openings. Your help and
assistance in assuring all actions are completed in these stores as required will be
greatly appreciated. If you should have any questions, please contact me.

Sincerely,

Tony
