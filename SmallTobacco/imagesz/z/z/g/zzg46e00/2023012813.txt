TO: The Members of the Executive Committee

FROM: Samuel D. Chilcote, gr. To

 

A friendly, non-tobacco agricultural organization recently
forwarded to The Institute the enclosed correspondence from the
White House. The group, which wishes to remain anonymous, was
particularly surprised to hear President Clinton’s views on
tobacco export issues, since it had not written the President on
this -- or any other ~-- matter.

The letter expressing the Administration’s concerns about U.S.
trade and tobacco export issues is enclosed, for your
information.
