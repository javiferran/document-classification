wow! while i realize this is still an in-progress project and costs are estimated, i just
wanted to thank you for a great job. and how quickly you were able to get it to us.

i'm especially impressed at all the centerspreads you have already been able to confirm.
that's terrific, and a big cost saver!

Talso think your decisions to remove titles (e.g., trips, people) were wise decisions. and
i'm very excited that CAMEL will have the first tobacco advertising to grace the pages of
Wired! and in a very impactful way!

thanks too for adding those notes -- especially pointing out major changes such as Bikini
going perfect bound with new specs as of the October issue, and Rolling Stone going
perfect bound for the 11/12 issue.

Brice/Don: we need to make some decisions quick. while sue has verbally committed, the
magazines will want to have hard insertion orders to absolutely guarantee positions such
as centerspread, and so Sue can negotiate the best up-front position for our insert where
centerspread doesn't apply. as soon as LHC can issue the orders, the better.

So we have to make some decisions and need approval as quickly as we can get it on the
list and the number of insertions. (wow -- 80.5MM circulation -- that's 'mighty tasty!)
