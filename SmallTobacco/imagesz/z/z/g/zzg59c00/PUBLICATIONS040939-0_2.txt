4-methoxyestrone, 2-MeO-E: and 4-MeO-E, did not affect the
methylation of 4-GH-E, (data not shown). The inhibition of
methylation of 4-OH-E, by 2-OH-E: was pH dependent and
increased with increasing pH (Figure 6). The formation of both
methyl ether isomers to be affected equally up to pH
8.5. At pH 9.0 and beyond, the formation of 4-OH-Ey-3Me was
inhibived slightly more than that of 4-McO-Es. The COMT-
catalyzed methylation of 2-OH-E» (10-30 pM) was not affected
by 4-OH-E, in the concentration range $-60 pM (data not
shown).

Discussion

The apparent affinity of 4O8-E;, of 10.5 uM for COMT., found
in this study, is consistent with that reported in the literamre (8)
and of the same order of magnitude as that of several 2-O8-CE
(7.8). Nevertheless, 2-OH-E, was able to inhibit markedly the
O-methylation of 4-OH-E; in vitro. That this may also occur in
vive is suggested by ‘observations that the MCR of 4-OH-CE in

the intact organism is much lower than that of 2-OH-CE (3.4).
In estrogen-treated hamsters. in which hormone is released from
implants in micromolar quantities (27). itis possible chat 2- and
4+O8-CE are formed in simifar large amounts so that O-
methylation of 4-OH-CE is inhibited by the approximately
equimolar concentrations of 2-OH-CE.

The inhibition of O-methylation of 4-OH-E, characterized
in this study also explains the failure to detect significant
4-hydroxylation of estrogens when assayed by the COMT-
coupled radioenzymatic assay for CE formauon 422.24). By
using a direct product isolation assay microsomes from several
estrogen target organs have been shown to mediate 4-hydroxyt-
ation of estrogens both via a discrete NADPH-dependent
estrogen-4-hydroxylase. which generates sdicly or predominantly
340H-CE, and a peroxidatic. organic hydroperontde-dependent
estrogen-2/4-hydroxylase which generates 2- and 4-OH-CE in
similar amounts (9.10). The ability of 2-OH-CE and. possibly.
of other catechols to inhibit the O-methylanon of 4-OH-CE could
serve to prevent their jnactivauon by COMT and permit them
to exert local autocrine of paracrine effects. Specifically.
in mouse uterus, 2 target of estrogen-induced cancer, 2- and
$-OH-CE were shown to be formed in Approximately equal
amounts ¢11). Moreover. in the hamster kidney. an organ in
which microsomal equimolar 2- and 4-QH-CE formation by both
NADPH-dependent and OHP-dependent mechanisms have been
demonstrated, we have proposed 4-OH-CE to be mediators of
the carcinogenic action of estrogens on this organ (13). The
4-OH-CE generated in this tissue. by 2-OH-CE from
inactivation by COMT, could remain available as substrates for
