Methylation of catecholestrogens catalyzed by catechol-
O-methyltransferase provides a major route for the rapid
metabotic clearance of these steroids. However, the metabolic
clearance rate of 4-hydroxyestradio! (4-OH-E,) is consider-
ably lower than that of 2-hydroxyestradiol, although 2- and
<@-hydroxycatechotestrogens (2- and 4-OH-CE) have similar
apparent affinities for the enzyme. To determine the reason
for this apparent paradox we have examined whether the
efficiency of O-methylation of 4-OH-E, could be affected by
other catecholestrogens or their G-methyi ethers. The ratio
of 4-methoxyestradio!:4-hydroxyestradiol 3-methy) ether
was 2.6 at pH 8.5, the pH optimum for the reaction.
‘The O-methyiation of 4-0H-E, (apparent X,, 210.41) was
inhibited by 2-hydroxyestradio! (2-OH-E;) but not by 2- or
<@-methoxyestrogens, The values for K,,, Vm, a5 well as
the slope for the methylation of 4-OH-E, were altered by
2-OH-E, indicating a mixed inhibition. The inhibition
constant for the intercept 1/V nay versus 2~OH-E, concen-
trations and the inhibition constant for the slope versus
2~OH-E; concentrations were 3S and 5.7 2M, respectively.
‘The inhibition of O-methytation of 4-OH-E, by 2-OH-E,
increased with the pH. In target tissues of the carcinogenic
a@ction of estrogens such as the rat pituitary, hamster kidney,
Or mouse uterus in which 2- and 4-OH-CE are both generated
in almost equal amounts, the Inactivation of 4-<OQH-CE by
O-methylation may be impeded. Consequently, 4-QH-E,
would remain available as substrate for redox cycling,
generation of active radicals and DNA damage.

ts much flower than that of 2-OH-CE (3.4) although 2- and
4-OH-CE have similar apparent affinities for COMT and the
O-methylation of 2-OH-E; and 4-OH-E, in vitro, whether by
purified COMT or cytosol. proceeds equally well (7.8). To
deiermiine the reason for this apparent paradox we have examined
whether the efficiency of O-methylation of 4-OH-CE could be
affected by either 2-OH-CE or by the O-methylated products of
2- or 4-OH-CE. This question is of interest because of recent
findings of equimolar 4-OH-CE and 2-OH-CE formation in
several extrahepatic tissues (9— 13). In these organs, rat pituitary,
Mouse uterus and hamster kidney. catecholestragens (CE) have
been postulated to play 2 sole in estrogen-induced tumor formation
(14.15). Elevated 4-hydroxylation of estrogen in these three
targets of estrogen-induced cancer compared to hepatic 4-OH-CE
synthesis suggests a carcinogenic role of these metabolites. since
4-GH-E, but not 2-OH-E, have been shown to induce renal
turnors in hamsters (16). Protection of 4-OH-CE from inactivation
by 2-OH-CE would either enhance or permit the ability of
4-OH-CE to exert endocrine and carcinogenic effects.

COMT generates two isomeric monomethyl ethers from
each CE, i.e. 2-methoxyestradiol (2-McO-E,) and 2-hydroxy-
estradiot 3-methyl ether (2-OH-E,-3Me) from 2-OH-E, and
4-methoxyestradiol (4-MeO-E), and 4-hydroxyestradiol
3-methy! ether (4-OH-E;-3Mc} from 4-OH-E, (17) (Figure
11. In the case of 2-OH-~CE, large differences in ratios of
2-MeO-E;:2-OH-E,-3Me have been repored when they were
assayed in vitro (t:1). in broken cell preparations or intact cells
(30:1) [reviewed by Knuppen (17)]. There are no corresponding
data on the influence of assay conditions on the ratios of the two
monomethyl ethers of 4-OH-CE. Therefore, before examining
any inhibitory effects on the COMT-catalyzed O-methylation of
4-OH-CE we established the characteristics of the formation of
the two monomethy! ethers of 4-OH-E..
