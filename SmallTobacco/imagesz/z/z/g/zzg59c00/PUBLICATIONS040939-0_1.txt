O-Methylation of 4-OH-E, by COMT

The formation of monomethy! ethers from 2- and 4-OH-CE was
linear with time for up to 90 min 31 pH 8.0 and their ratios did
not change significantly during this time. The ratio of the two
mmonomethy! ethers of 4-OH-E;. 4-MeO-E,:4-OH-E,-3Me. was.
2.6:1 at pH §.5 in Tris— HCI buffer (Table D. Under the same
conditions the ratio of 2-MeO-E.:2-OH-E)-3Me was 1.5. The
laner data are consistent with values teported previously (25).

‘The ratio of the two monomeiby! ethers of 4-OH-CE was noi
influenced by substrate concentrations between 5 and 60 uM. by
the concentrations of SAM iodide between 0.| and 1.0 mM or
of MgCl, between 0.3 and 3.0 mM (data nol shown). There
was no evidence for methyl migration, demethylation of the
methoxyestrogens or formation of dimethyl ethers under any of
the conditions.

The formation of the nwo isomeric monomethy! ethers of
4-OH-E, was linear with increasing substrate concentration and
reached a maximum at 30 ~M E,. The apparent X,, for both
isomeric monomethyl ethers of 4-OH-E, was 10.5 aM (Figure
2), which was similar to the apparent K,, of 2-OH-E, (11 uM)
teported for the cat liver enzyme (3).

‘The optimal pH for total ©-methylation of 4-OH-CE was 8.5
(Figure 3). This pH curve for the formation of methyl ethers
is similar to the pH curve of this enzyme observed previously
(21), 4Me0-E, formation predominated in the tange of pH
7.09.0, was maximal at pH 8.5 and then declined (Figure 3:

8.0. increased between pH 8.0~9.0, then reached a plateau. This
curve resembled a titration curve of the methylation of a catechol
(26). The characteristics of methylation of 4-OW-CE may be
defined by the relative acidity of the phenolic OH-groups (26).
inhibition of the O-merhvlation of 4-OH-E,

The COMT-catalyzed methylation of 4-OH-E, was inhibited by
2-O8-E, in a concentration dependent manners. The inhibition
pattern was of mixed type. Values of Ki. Vea, and slope for the I
methylation of 2-OH-E, were altered by 2-OH-E, (Figure 4).
