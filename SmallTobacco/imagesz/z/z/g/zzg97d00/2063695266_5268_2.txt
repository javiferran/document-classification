CONCLUSIONS

The findings from this research suggest that Generation Xers will respond to
marketing efforts that are different than those to which they have already been
exposed. For instance,new ways of reaching this audience (ie. different
advertising mediums, different outlets for purchasing product, new types of
promotions) will likely capture their attention by making the product stand out
from the crowd.

Subject matter that is relevant to Generation Xers (new adventures, fun) could be
incorporated in promotions and advertising. Further, the approach could be on a
personal rather than global level, appealing to their self-focus. Importantly, any
marketing effort aimed at this audience should not obviously target them because
they find that unappealing.
