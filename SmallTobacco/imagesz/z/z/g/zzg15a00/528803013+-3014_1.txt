All CellularONE phones provisioned and supported under the RJRT corporate agreement
are affected by this change. Because these phones are under one billing account number,
all phones will share the same corporate PIN. The RJRT PIN is 9210. Inspite of its
ubiquity, the PIN is proprietary information -

It should NOT be shared with unathorized personnel, no exceptions.

Please provide this information to individuals in your area who have a need to know. If
you have any questions, call Mary Reavis at extension x2811 or Ann Long at x3740.
