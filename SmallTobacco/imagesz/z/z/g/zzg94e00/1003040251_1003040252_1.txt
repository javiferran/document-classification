At Philip Morris, we have confidence in the future of our

company and the tobacco industry. We recently announced the

construction of a new cigarette manufacturing facility in
Cabarrus County, North Carolina. We believe that tobacco will
continue to play a significant role in the economic and social

life of our nation.
