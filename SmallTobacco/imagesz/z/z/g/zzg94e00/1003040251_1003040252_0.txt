Suggested Remarks Following Surgeon General's Report

Date) January 10, 1979

 

Philip Morris Incorporated is a strong advocate of public
debate. It is through such discussion and analysis of the
issues that our citizens are able to reach their own personal
decisions. When, however, a federal government department oo
takes it upon itself to prohibit the making of that free choice,
we have moved out of the realm of public discussion and into ~
that of coercion.

This is where Mr. Califano, in his misguided zealousness,

has taken us. Rather than devoting his time and money to in-

- creased tobacco and health research, he has chosen to expend

them on a public relations campaign aimed at making, smokers
appear as second class citizens whose rights are not worth

protecting. Such demagoguery serves only to cloud the issue,

_and is of no value in finding answers to public questions.

In the last twenty years Philip Morris, along with
other members of the tobacco industry, has provided more than
$70 million for independent research on smoking and health
questions. In many of these years this commitment has exceeded
that of any government department, andi has been substantially
more than the research expenditure reported by all the voluntary

health associations combined.
