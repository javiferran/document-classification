re: Grant Application #1133M

Dear Dr. Lisanti:

The original proposal (#1133M) included studies on endo-
thelial cells and platelets. However, due to decreased
: funding for the period July 1977 thru June 1978, progress
@ on several of the important long term aims has been sev-
erely impeded, This has resulted in a drastic change of
research priorities and has necessitated the deletion of
studies pertaining to platelets from this proposal.

Dr. Wu has submitted a separate proposal (including a sep-
arate budget and progress report) dealing with platelets
only. These are two separate, independent and unrelated
proposals and should be evaluated as such. Independent
budgets and possible budgetary cuts will effect either
endothelial cell studies or platelet studies and will not
require reallocation of decreased funds and hence decreased
productivity or elimination of specific aims in either of
the research areas. These two important research areas
should not have to compete for available funds within the
same grant proposal.

We would appreciate your consideration of this problem
and the two separate proposais. If you have any questions
regarding this matter please do not hesitate to contact me,

Sincerely

 

rd) Associate Professor
