Subject: Merit

Just to follow-up on one deliverable from the Merit meeting. Merit conducted a coupon test, looking at carton vs
carton/pack offers. (page 38 of deck) .

You were going to break it out by decile, so we could see how the upper deciles performed vs the lower. Monica will be
providing program numbers (and whatever else you need to move forward).

How long does something like this take?
