Timetable - 1986

M.D. Wallace From: K.A. Needs

he consumer and extended use
of 1986. The point with
jive schedule occurs
jon for the Wave VI

consumer Test. e filter is not

incorporable,

The first will be the burden placed on Ken Rush's
fabrication unit to produce products for both the internal
extended use test and external mini product concept test
(20 days production time from 9/24 - 10/23). This obviously
would necessitate the exclusion of almost all other test products
being manufactured during this time period.

Secondly and more important, the 12/3 Product Concept Test
products will have to be produced by Operations Development due
to the large quantity of products required. This, the failure to
have the polypropylene filter incerporated into the Wave VI
Consumer Test would lead to introducing it into the 12/3 Product
Concept Test with no prior consumer information.

Hopefully, these issues can be resolved quickly so that our
current timetables are not impacted. If you have further
questions, please give me call.
