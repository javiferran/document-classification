Dear BRoctor Marsaro!

At the recent meeting of our Scientific Advisory
Board, your epplication for & research grant was discussed
at some length, The scientific merit of your work wes
recognized and the importance of its continuation acknow-
ledgeds however, in view of the many meritorious proposals
for scientific studies now pending before the Board and the
aeveral scientific areas which have as yet received inadequate
attention, it ie their judgeent that current funds should be
committed in other directions.

The action of the Board in this ins§$aace does not
in any way prejudice their consideration of any new proposal
thet you may wish to svbmit.

If you wish to discuss current priorities in the
Council's program, I suggest that you communicate with
Dr, Robert C. Hockett, Vice President,

Through our letter of Decesber 29 1970 we authorized
a time extension of your previous project deusre, from December 31,
1970 to February 2°, 1971. The Board has now approveé a further
extension to June JO with permission to retain and utilize un-
expended funds, estimated at approximately $9,099.66 as of

Jenuary 1, for the purposes of the study ae originally approved, = -
We trust that this extenaion will be materially helpful in

rounding out that study.

Sincerely yours,

Ww. t. Hoyt
