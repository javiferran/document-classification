RECRUITMENT SCREENER:

Attached is the screener to be used in recruiting all respondents. The order
of these questions must be maintained for security reasons.

Respondents should be sent a postcard reminding them of the time and place of
their scheduled group. In addition, respondents should be contacted the day
prior to their scheduled group to confirm their attendance.

Also, 1 will need the attached respondent summary sheet (Attachment IJ)
completed for my use in case the show rate is better than expected.

pem. participants and snacks/refreshments for the other participants.
