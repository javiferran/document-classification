Subject: RE: Fires in Montana

Yes, we do. But our Regional Government Affairs people take the lead in recommending actions.
Ergo, I'm copying Ginny Corwin in Denver wha recently has had experience in Los Alamos and
confronts fires in several states. Normally we would not act unless there is widespread damage and
victims numbering in the thousands. Were we to respond, we would need to have the particulars (tax
1.D., address, contact, phone, etc.) for the grantee. Also, we would probably check with the Red Cross
to see what the needs are so we do not duplicate. Finally, we could consider a shipment of food from
Kraft. So for that reason, I'm also copying Kathy Spear, who is our Task Force leader for KFNA. Let's
see what Ginny says. .

Thanks, Gracias, Merci, Obrigado
