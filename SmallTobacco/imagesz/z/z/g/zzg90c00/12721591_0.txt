Re: Carlton Filter King-Size Box
Paint Completion Report/January, 1982 Repaint

Dear Norm:

The attachment lists the completion dates for the January, 1982
repaint in the LC&F markets.

January creative for all but six unité is: "U.S. GOV'T REPORT":
(Black lettering--angled left corney) "Carlton is lowest"

(Red lettering) "Today's Carlton has even less tar than the
version tested for the Government'S 1981 Report. Despite new
low tar brands introduced since -- Carlton still lowest. Box-~
less than 0.01 mg. tar, 0.002 mgf nic.” (black lettering).

Pack pictorial.is the Carlton Fyiter King Size Box.

     
  
  
 
 

Six bulletins are displaying the "U.S. GOV'T REPORT" line in
a horizontal position becausefof the dimensions of the units.

Extreme weather conditions if various markets have precluded
the outdoor advertising companies from complying with our
Jeeway date of January 15.

We are compiling a book offall the photographs and-will forward
it to you as soon as poss}
