Dear Joachim:

Iam writing to confirm our willingness to provide you with genomic DNA flanking the 5'-end
of the rabbit surfactant protein-A (SP-A) gene for your proposed studies to target Cre
recombinase to pulmonary epithelial cells. As you know, the SP-A gene is expressed in a
lung-specific manner, SP-A mRNA transcripts are detected primarily in type II pneumonocytes
and to a lesser extent in nonciliated bronchioalveolar epithelial (Clara) cells. We have found
in studies using transgenic mice that 4,000 bp of DNA flanking the 5'-end of the rabbit SP-A
gene targets reporter gene expression only in lung, and specifically to type II and Clara cells.
In consideration of the cell-specific nature of SP-A promoter activity, this genomic construct
should be most useful in targeting Cre recombinase to the same cell types in the lung that also
express gp330.

I read your grant proposal with great interest and believe that your studies using loxP/Cre
recombinanse-mediated gene targeting for creating cell-specific inactivation of 2p330 will yield
important information regarding the role of this protein in lung cell biology.

Sincerely,

CG RM ideban —_
