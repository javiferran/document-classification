1. Burger tape is not done. Making final edits tomorrow (Friday) morning. Can make
PAL copies if you wish. How many do you need?

2. Gloria E-mailed Burger's final presentation to Axel after the last meeting. Charts aren't
done yet. I need to check with Gary and Suzanne when they get back tomorrow on
progress on charts, At latest, they will be done by May 1 because we necd to use them in
Washington May 2. Burger is responsible for getting charts made.

Just in case, attached is another copy of the German presentation.
