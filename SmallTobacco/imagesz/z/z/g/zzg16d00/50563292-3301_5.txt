FIG. 5. Comparative dose responses of induction of murine TNF
(mTNF) activity by SLT-I (M), SLY-II (0), and LPS (@). Peritoneal
macrophages derived from C3H/HeN mice were stimulated with
10-fold dilutions of the toxins for 18 h at 37°C in humidified 5% CO,,
TNF activity in the culture supernatants was measured in quudrupli-
cate samples by the L929 cel! lysis assay as described in Materials and
Methods. The results shown are the averages of 12 determinations
from three separate experiments. An asterisk indicates a statistically
significant difference between SLT-I and SLT-I TNF production (? <
0.01 by a paired ¢ test).

Production of [L-la and IL-6 by murine macrophages
treated with SLTs. IL-lo and IL-6 are pleiotropic cytokines
which profoundly alter immune responsiveness (reviewed in
references 1 and 14). IL-lo acts on macrophages to induce
its own synthesis and the synthesis of TNF-a and [L-6. A
membrane-associated form of IL-lo may be important in
focusing the immune response to sites of inflammatory celt
infiltration. IL-6 acts on B lymphocytes to crive differentiation
and antibody production. In the presence of comitogens, IL-6
acts on T cells to stimulate IL-2 and I1.-2 receptor expression.
1L-6 mediates increased hepatocyte acute-phase protein syn-
thesis. Macrophages derived from C3H/HeN mice and treated
with 100 ng of SIT-1 per ml or 10 ng of LPS per ml produced
clevated levels of soluble immunoreactive IL-lo after pro-
Jonged incubation (24 to 27 h) with the inducers (Fig. 6A). As
was the case with TNF synthesis, we noted that IL-le levels

FIG. 6. Kinetics of TL-la (A) and IL-6 (B) production by C3H/
HeN macrophages stimulated by SLT-I (Ml) or LPS (@). Peritoneal
macrophages were stimulated with SLT-T (100 ng/ml} or LPS (10
ng/ml) and incubated at 37°C in humidified $% CO,, At the indicated
time points, culture supernatants were collected, and the levels of
immunoreaclive IL-la (mIL-1 ALPHA) and IL-6 (mIL-6) were mea-
sured in triplicate by an ELISA. Results shown are the averages of six
determinations from two separate experiments. Note the differences in
y-axis scales,

produced by LPS- and SLT-I-treated C3H/HeJ ceils were
reduced (~20 pg/ml at 36 h) compared with IL-la levels
produced by C3H/HeN cells. Both stimulants induced IL-6
expression fram C3H/HeN celis, although the kinetics differed
(Fig, 6B). LPS treatment resulted in elevated production and
secretion of IL-6 beginning at approximately 6 h poststimu-
lation. In contrast, elevated levels of TL-6 were first detected
in macrophage supernatants after 12 h of stimulation with
SLT-L
