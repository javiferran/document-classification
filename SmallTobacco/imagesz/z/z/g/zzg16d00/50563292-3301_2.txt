Cytokine assays, TNF bioactivity in macrophage superna-
tants was assessed by measuring lysis of L929 murine fibro-
blasts by the procedure described by Hill and McCallum (22).
Briefly, L929 cells were cultured in 96-well microtiter plates at
a density of 2 x 10° cells per well in Iscove’s modified
Dulbecco medium (Mediatech, Washington, D.C.) supple-
mented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Dilutions of macrophage
supernatants or recombinant murine TNF-a standard (Genen-
tech, South San Francisco, Calif.) were made in medium
containing 1 pg of actinomycin D (Sigma) per ml and added in
quadruplicate to the cells. After 18 h of incubation at 37°C in
humidified 5% CO, MTT was added and incubation was
continued for another ? h. The cells were lysed, and the
formazan dye was extracted for 4 h at 37°C with 50% N,N-
dimethyl formamide and 20% SDS. The A5,. was measured.
The amount of TNF present in the samples was estimated by
comparison of the survival values with a recombinant murine
TNF-a standard curve generated by linear regression analysis.
Controls included L929 cells treated with actinomycin D alone
and cells treated with actinomycin D plus SLT-I (100 ng/ml).
Compared with untreated cells, L929 cytotoxicity mediated by
actinomycin D plus SLT-I was consistently <10%. Commer-
cially available enzyme-linked immunosorben: assay (ELISA)
kits were used as described in the manufacturer’s instructions
to quantitate levels of immunoreactive murine IL-la (Gen-
zyme Corp., Boston, Mass.) and IL-6 (Endogen Inc., Boston,
Mass.). Statistical analyses using a paired ¢ test were performed
with Microsoft Excel version 4.0 software (Microsoft Corp.,
Redmond, Wash.).

Preparation and labeling of murine TNF-o and GAPDH
nucleotide probes. By using an automated DNA synthesizer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.}, the following sense
and antisense oligonucleotide primers were synthesized: 5'-
CCCCAAAAGATGGGGGGC-3’ and 5’-CCCATCGGCIG
GCACACAC-3’, corresponding to nucleotides 221 to 238 and
568 to 551 of the murine TNF-« cDNA (11), and 5'-CCATG
GAGAAGGCTGGG-3' and 5’-CAAAGTTGTCATGGAT
GACC-3’, corresponding to nucleotides 386 to 403 and 380 to
561 of glyceraldchyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
cDNA (18). The respective primers were used to amplify a
345-bp fragment of murine TNF-c cDNA or a 195-bp frag-
ment of GAPDH cDNA by PCR. Each deoxynucleoside
triphosphate (0.2 4M) and a 0.4 4M concentration of each of
the sensc and antisense primers were added to PCR buffer (10
mM Tris HCl, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl, 0.01% [wt/vol]
gelatin). The amplification profile was: denaturation, 95°C, 1
min; annealing, 55°C, 1 min; extension, 72°C, 2 min, for 30
cycles followed by an extension incubation at 72°C for 7 min.
PCR products were extracted with phenol-chloroform and
precipitated with ethanol and ammonium acetate. Aliquots of
the PCR products were electrophoresed into 2% agarose gels
and stained with ethidium bromide, and the electrophoretic
migration was compared with that of the DNA standard
prepared from Haelll-digested bX174 DNA. PCR product
purity was assessed by measuring optical densities at 260 and
280 nm. Approximately 25-ng samples of the PCR products
were then used as templates for radiolabeling by random
priming with [°?P]dCTP (Prime-A-Gene kit, Amersham Corp.,
Arlington Heights, Ill.). The probes were purified by using
Sephadex G-50 spin columns (5 Prime-3 Prime Inc., Boulder,
Colo.).

Viability was measured by uptake of the dye MTT. Untreated cells

detached by using sterile rubber policemen and the cells were
pelleted by centrifugation at 735 X g. Cell pellets were lysed in
ice-cold guanidinium solution (4 M guanidinium isothiocya-
nate, 20 mM sodium acetate {pH 5.2], 2% Sarkosyl, 1%
mercaptocthanol) for 20 min. Nucleic acids were extracted
twice with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl aleohol (25:24:1) and
precipitated with ammonium acetate and ethanol. RNA purity
was assessed by measuring optical densities at 260 and 280 nm.
Three micrograms of RNA from each sample was applied
under vacuum to nylon membranes (GeneScreen Plus; NEN
Research Products, Boston, Mass.) by using a slot blot appa-
ratus (Filtration Manifold System; Gibco/BRL, Gaithersburg,
Md.). The blots were prehybridized in Rapid-hyb Buffer
(Amersham Corp.) for 15 min at 65°C in a Hybridiser HB-1D
hybridization oven (Techne Inc., Princeton, N.J.) and hybrid-
ized in buffer containing ~6 X 10° cpm of the TNF-a or
GAPDH probe. After a 3-h incubation, the blots were washed
at room temperature in 2X S8C-0.1* SDS (1 SSC is 0.15 M
NaC] plus 0.015 M sodium citrate) for 15 min with gentle
agitation. The blots were dried, and the radioactivity associated
with macrophage RNA was directly quantitated for 1h with a
Betascope 603 blot analyzer (Betagen Corp., Waltham, Mass.).
The blots were then exposed to X-ray film for 2 to 4 days. Data
are expressed as the ratio of TNF-c counts/GAPDH counts.

RESULTS

Cytotoxicity studies. The cytotoxicity of SLT-1 and SLT-0
for murine peritoneal macrophages and Vero cells was as-
sessed by incubating cclls for 18, 36, and 48 h with serial 10-fold
dilutions of the purified toxins. Cells were then treated with the
dye MTT and lysed, and the optical density at 570 nm was
measured. In accordance with earlier studies (28), Vero cells
were sensitive to the cytotoxic action of SLT-I (Fig. 1) and
SLT-II (data not shown); the toxin doses necessary to kill 50%
of the cells in a well were --1.0 to 10 pg. In contrast, murine
peritoneal macrophages were generally refractory to the cyto-
toxic activity of the toxins at all of the time points tested; only
incubation of macrophages for 48 h with the highest dose of
