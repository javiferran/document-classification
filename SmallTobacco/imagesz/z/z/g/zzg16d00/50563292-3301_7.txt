produced by C3H/HeJ macrophages following stimulation with
SLTs.

On a per weight basis, SI.Ts are clearly less efficient with
respect to LPS at inducing cytokine expression from murine
macrophages: ~10 times more SLT is needed to induce
comparable levels of soluble cytokines in raacrophage super-
natants. With the exception of IL-1a, the kinetics of cytokine
induction were also delayed when SLTs were used as stimu-
lants compared with that when stimulation with LPS was used.
In keeping with the delayed kinetics of soluble TNF produc-
tion, we demonstrated that SLT-I induced delayed transcrip-
tional! activation of the gene encoding TNF-a in comparison
with the LPS transcriptional response. The precise reason for
the delay in transcriptional activation is not known; but the
delay may reflect the time necessary for SLTs to be internal-
ized or generate a transmembrane signal. It should also be
noted that DNA sequences upstream of the TNF-« promoter
contain a number of putative transcriptional activator-binding
sites, including at least five NF-«B/NF-GMa binding sites,
sequences identical to the major histocompatibility complex
class II Y box (a member of the CCAAT box family of
cis-active sites), a purine-rich box, and an Spl binding site
(reviewed in reference 26). In addition, enhancer core se-
quences are found in the intron between the third and fourth
exons of the murine TNF gene. Given the large number of
putative transcriptional regulatory sites, it is not unreasonable
to speculate that LPS and SLTs may activate TNF transcrip~
tion by separate mechanisms. Studies on TNF gene activation
also raise an important caveat in extrapolating the data re-
ported here by using murine macrophages to human cells.
DNA sequences upstream of the murine and human TNF
genes are not highly conserved. For example, an activator
protein-2 binding site found upstream of the human TNF gene
is absent in the mouse, while the major histocompatinility
complex class I] Y box is unique to the murine sequence.
Therefore, the cytokine response mediated by SLTs in human
macrophages may differ from that of murine cells. The delayed
expression of IL-6 compared with that of TNF in LPS- or
SLT-stimulated cells is consistent with earlier studies showing
that TNF-« and IL-1 may augment the production of IL-6.
Finally, studies utilizing human peripheral blood monocytes
showed that LPS rapidly induced IL-lo mRNA and resulted in
the intracellular accumulation of the 31-kDa precursor form of
[L-le (36). However, the release of the 17-kDa form of the
molecule from monocytes was significanily delayed, being
immunoprecipitated from supernatants --12 h after stimula-
tion (21). In accordance with these results, we also detected the
delayed release of immunoreactive TL-le from LPS- or SLT-
stimulated murine macrophages.
