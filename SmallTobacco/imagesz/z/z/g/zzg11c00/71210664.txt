Larry-

This note is to let you know that the Corporate & Youth Responsibility
group at Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation is truly pleased with the
results of the Initiative Towards Smokefree Youth (“ITS Youth’) program
sponsored through the Housing Authority of Louisville’s Youth
Development program.

We received your report last week and noted the active involvement of
participants, the positive curriculum, and the impressive results.

Congratulations on an excellent project so far. We encourage you to keep
up the good work.

Sincerely yours,

CY
