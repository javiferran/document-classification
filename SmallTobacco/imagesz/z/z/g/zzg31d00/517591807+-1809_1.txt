There are, of course, problems with these prototypes, The translucent
cigarette paper is unattractive but may be made opaque with the addition of low
levels of Ti0, (1-2%). Additionally, the ash appearance is poor.

In spite of the deficiencies, these prototypes demonstrate that
Jow-sidestream cigarettes may be made with smoking characteristrics and
sidestream aroma which are more acceptable than current CC-prototypes. I
recommend the following.

e Arelatively short-term project should be initiated to develop an
alternative to the CC~prototypes with the use of CaC0.~free cigarette
paper together with highly expanded tobacco blends. the elgarette
papers should be relatively easy to obtain from Schweitzer or
de Maduit. At the recent CORESTA meeting, N. Baskevitch (de Maduit)
indicated to me that such papers are easily obtained in Europe.

e A somewhat longer term project should be initiated to examine the use
of CaC0,~free cigarette paper and highly expanded tobacco blends
together with “carbonized” filler. The goal of this development
should be to achieve extremely low sidestream deliveries.

@ Acontinuing exploratory project should be initiated to investigate
other means of sidestream reduction. For example, the use of G-7 to
reduce sidestream deliveries (10M, DET to J. Bs Wilson, 9/8/81; IM,
L. G. Dube and T. A. Perfetti to R. A.Lloyd, 12/2/81; L. G. Dube and
T. A. Perfetti, R&DM, 1981, No. 46; F. Best, CIM, 1977, No. 11) should
be pursued diligently. As a part of this exploratory project,
important patent claims (e.g. U.S. 4,347,855 to Philip Morris, Inc.)
should be carefully examined (in the laboratory when possible).

Your comments are encouraged.
