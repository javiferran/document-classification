Dear Dr. Gardner:

Following our discussion in New Haven, I reviewed my twin
populations born between 1897 and 1952. Our records show that there
were 7,859 pairs of like-sexed twins born in this period who sur-
vived to one year of age. Studies we have conducted in the past
would lead me to say that we should be able to locate approximately
60% or better of this population with both members alive and living
in Connecticut. This certainly is more than the minimum number of
pairs we discussed.

I have requested permission to attend the meeting in Miami
Beach the week of December 10 and have made reservations for arriv-
ing on the 9th. I hope you will make reservations for me. I anti-
cipate approval of my request and hope to see you shortly.

Sincerely yours,

WMA
