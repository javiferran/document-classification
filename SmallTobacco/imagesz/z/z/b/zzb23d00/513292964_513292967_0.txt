#8 KDF-2 at No. 64

1. Current Status

a. Modifications were made and operation is much improved
(reference Bad Wrap Task Force Minutes dated 12-1-80).

Size and weight control tests will be repeated before
Christmas to verify results.

Machine has not been operated continuously at speeds above
450 meters per minute (4500 cuts per minute). Concern was
expressed regarding heat buildup and cutting head ledger

and knife flutter at higher speeds. Increased noise levels
would also be a problen.

2. Action Plan

a. Verify quality at current operating speeds with size and
weight control (complete before Christmas).

b. Begin comprehensive testing in accordance with test designed

by Bad Wrap Task Force as soon as possible after quality

verification completed in early January. NOTE: High speed

test should be at 525 meters per minute (5250 cuts per minute).

c. Report on progress mid-January.
