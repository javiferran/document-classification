Subject: Ranch Roller Bag

Katie -- As discussed, Legal has a patent issue with the wheels on the catalog roller-bag. (We were reordering the
exact bag without branding for the Ranch program.) Beth and | presented this bag as a back-up option, when we
learned that there would be a long trademark search on the telescoping handle bag. We were under the impression
that this option would easily be approved. Unfortunately, this assumption was wrong, since over the past few years
(since the catalog version) a patent has been filed on the wheel housing/mechanism.

Based on this assumption of clearance, we placed an order for the first 500 ($16,750) to meet the April delivery date.
Another PO was set up far the balance of 2,900 (for del. in late June). This PO could have been cancelled any time
before late April prod. start, if we didn't get legal clearance.

In discussions today, the following resolutions have been determined:

1) Wheeled bags already produced can be distributed at Ranch. We are confirming what part of 500 are finished
to-date -- estimate: 300. Firm answer tomorrow.
2) Balance of 500 -- and entire new order of 2,900 will be produced without wheels.
3) Spec Revisions will involve: a) Moving side handie to be even with other side handle. (This was moved closer to
the base of the bag to make for easier wheeling.)

b) Piastic runner strips on base of bag will be centered within length of bag. (Currently, they're closer to top end
to allow room for wheel mechanism).

We will have these spec revisions made, and forward to Christine for Jay Mohr's approval. Since we cannot proceed
with balance of order until we receive this approval, our second delivery date will most likely be delayed. Call if you
have questions.
