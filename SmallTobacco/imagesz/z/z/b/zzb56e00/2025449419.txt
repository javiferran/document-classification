Subject: Low Sidestream Cigarette Papers

Enclosed are seventeen bobbins of low sidestream paper for your model development.
There are three different grades represented in the two boxes we are shipping to you due to
limited availablity of one of the grades. We supplemented the same two Kimberly-Clark
grades you have used before (044 and 049) with a new grade that was made in May, 94 with a
modified fiber refining process (grade 085). Descriptions of all three grades are listed
below. The bobbins that have been perforated by ESP have a -P written inside the core,
while the non-perforated bobbins have a -N after the code.

Grade 044 is the commercial paper used on our Superslims cigarettes. There may be
another mill trial to reproduce grade 049 towards the end of July, but until then there is
no more paper available of that grade. We also have a very limited supply of a paper with a
basis weight of 47 g/mâ€™ . If you think you might need an intermediate weight paper for
faster burn rate or a lower Coresta paper for additional sidestream reduction, we can ship
more samples at a later date.

Paper parameters for current low sidestream papers:
