Grinding Areg

Pilot studies have determined that the current Williams grinder would be too small to
meet the increased throughput and greater grind fineness required for NBL. The
following is a table showing the predicted through-put of the current Williams mill at the
BL plant and the scaling factor provided by Williams for some larger grinders.

Assumptions

1. Production Dust and Hammermilled Burley Stem will be ground together.
2. Grind fineness of 95%< 120 mesh is targeted.
3

. Ambient air or enough heat to maintain current 7% O.V. target for dust and

stems.
4. Internal classifier rather than sweco screens. NAS Ye

Williams Through-put

Grinder Scaling Factor 95%< 120 mesh Cost (Williams Est.)

Titan (BL Plant) 40% | 4,200 lb/hr

Giant 68% 7,140 lb/hr $ 600,000

Super Giant 100% 10,500 lb/hr $ 750,000

Hercules 123% 12,900 lb/hr $ 900,000

Considerations

1, Current grinder capacity of Production Dust ground to 95%< 60 mesh is
8,000 lb/hr. Current Production Dust usage rate is approx. 4,550 lb/hr.

2. Additional heat will increase grinding throughput significantly i.e. 20 -30% at
4% exit O.V.
