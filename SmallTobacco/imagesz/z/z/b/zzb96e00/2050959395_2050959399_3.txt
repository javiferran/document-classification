rming Drying Ar

Dryer load calculations and dryer model predictions indicate that the production line
speed for meeting the 8,500 lb/hr target could be achieved with a slight increase in sheet

weight i.e. 12 grm/sqft Vs 11.4 grm/sqft., a wider belt i.e. 62" vs. 59" and an increase in
line speed from 330 fpm to 390 fpm.
