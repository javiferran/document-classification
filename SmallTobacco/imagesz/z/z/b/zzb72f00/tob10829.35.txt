SMOKING IN SWEDEN

o Per capita adult (> 15 yrs. old) cigarette consumption increased
from 1,726 units in 1977 to 1,781 units in 1981 -- averaging 0.6

percent a year, but variable.

Overall sales of cigarettes in Sweden declined for only one year in
this 1977-8L interval, and increased for all other years to 1982.

 

From 1977 to 1980, Sweden's population increased by only 0.7 percent,
but cigarette sales during this period increased by 4.87 percent (from
11.357 billion cigarettes to 11.91 billion).

o Per capita adult cigarette consumption for the period 1975 to 1981
was strongly correlated with sales, with regard to statistical
variability, but Swedish population increase was not significantly
related to sales variations.

An article of May 1982 in the Swedish Journal Nordisk Medecin, Vol.
97, Ppp 134-136, indicated that total tobacco consumption in Sweden is
remarkably stable. Among the conclusions were the facts that some
heavy to moderate male smokers have increased use of snuff; there was
an increase in smoking quantities among women; the percentage of male
smokers declined moderately but steadily.

Svenska Tobaks AB information dept. reported data [in 1982] on which
these trends are based. They also report that 4 percent of the

population roll their own, and these cigarette smokers may increase
the actual number of cigarette smokers in Sweden when they are added
to those who smoke manufactured cigarettes (the latter 33 percent of

all adults).
