_ Expression of the tropomyosin-1 isoform was enhanced by cDNA transfer in non-transformed
murine 3T3 fibroblasts and also in v-Ki-ras transformed fibroblasts in which native tropomyosin-1
expression had been reduced and tropomyosin-2 synthesis virtually eliminated by action of the
oncogene. The level of synthesis of insert-derived tropomyosin-1 was similar in normal and trans-
formed transductants (3-5 times normal levels). The high level of insert-derived tropomyosin-1
expression resulted in a considerable increase in tropomyosin-1 utilization in the cytoskeleton of
transformed cells, but this expression still did not reach normal levels, suggesting an oncogene-
related inhibition of tropomyosin utilization. A large proportion of newly synthesized native tropo-
myosin-1 in normal, unmodified fibroblasts appeared in homodimers which, upon prolonged incuba-
tion, were largely converted to the heterodimers. Excess tropomyosin-1 derived from the inserted

cDNA also appeared largely as the homodimer in both normal and transformed cells. This homodi-
mer was utilized effectively in the formation of cytoskeletal structures but was partially converted

to heterodimer by chain exchange. Under steady:
toskeletal tropomyosin-1-containing dimers were

-state conditions, approximately 33% of the cy-
homodimers, compared to approximately 10% in

normal fibroblasts. The results show that the increased amounf of tropomyosin-1 homodimer enter-
ing the cytoskeleton under conditions of tropomyosin-i excess, results in an atypical microfilament
composition. The effect of this excess of tropomyosin-1 homodimers on stability or function of
microfilament fibers remains to be determined. The results also confirm that the mechanisms of

rapid homodimer formation with conversion to
vitro studies, also occur in vive.

The synthesis of several microfilament-associated pro-
teins, including tropomyosin (Cooper et al., 1985), vinculin
(Raz and Geiger, 1982, Fernandez et al., 1992), a-actinin
(Gluck et al., 1993), and gelsolin (Vandekerckhove et al.,
1990) have been reported to be suppressed in neoplastically
transformed fibroblasts. Among these, tropomyosin has been
extensively studied.

Tropomyosins are a family of ubiquitous actin-binding
proteins with extensive a-helical structure that play a well-
defined role in muscle contraction (Leavis and Gergely,
1984; Payne and Rudnick, 1985, Lees-Miller and Helfman,
1991), In non-muscle cells, the role of tropomyosins is less
clearly understood, and it is generally thought that they are
involved in stabilization of actin microfilaments which, in
tum, play an important role in maintaining cell shape, motil-

heterodimers by chain exchange, known from in

ity, and interaction with extracellular supporting elements
(Pollard et al., 1976; Coté, 1983; Stossel et al., 1985). The
terminology of tropomyosins used in this study is one in
general use for tropomyosins expressed in fibroblasts (Lea-
vitt et al., 1986). Tropomyosins-1—3 correspond, in increas-
ing order of electrophoretic mobility, to the high-M, tropo-
myosins (284 amino acids), which are homologous to tropo-
myosins expressed in muscle cells, while tropomyosin-4 and
tropomyosin-5 correspond to the low-M, tropomyosins (247
or 248 amino acids) characteristic of non-muscle cells. The
reader is also referred to footnote 2 of Lehrer and Qian
(1990) regarding the terminology of smooth muscle tropo-
myosins. A number of studies have shown that down-regula-
tion of expression of the high-M, tropomyosin isoforms con-
sistently accompanies neoplastic transformation of murine
and avian fibroblasts by a variety of retroviral oncogenes,
chemical mutagens and transforming growth factors (Hen-
dricks and Weintraub, 1981; Leonardi et al., 1982; Matsu-
mura et al., 1983; Hendricks and Weintraub, 1984; Cooper
et al., 1985, 1987; Leavitt et al., 1986). These findings have
led to the proposal that deficiency of tropomyosin expression
may be a causal biochemical event in neoplastic transforma-
