TITANI DIOXIDE I IL

SUMMARY

Worldwide consumption of TiO, in 1989 was 2.91 million tons.

The worldwide demand of TiO_ for filter tow (450000 tons of tow
in 1989) is about 3200 tons corresponding to 0.1 % of global
consumption.

The main resources for Tio are two types of ore: Ilmenite
(FeO TiO ) and Rutile (TiO_). (The anatas type of TiO. isa
@ifferent cristalline modification which is less abrasive and
therefore preferably used in fibers). Biggest supplier of ore is
Australia.

Two brands of cigarettes were equipped with two types of filters
having exactly the same specification except for TiO, content:
one type of filter had none, the other had 0.8 %.

Six laboratories participated and each of them analysed the
smoke of the four samples for PMWNF, nicotine, CO, taste, and
appearance.

The results concerning PMWNF, nicotine, CO, and taste were
almost unanimous: there is no significant difference between

cigarettes using a filter with or without 40, -

Differences were found in the evaluation of the appearance.
