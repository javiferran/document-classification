TITANI DIOXIDE I I ILTER:
ENERAL R E

Titanium dioxide is the number one pigment used in every-day
articles. It is found in automobiles and household appliances as
well as in paper products.

The main resources for TiO are two types of ore: Ilmenite
(FeO TiO_) and Rutile (TiO,_). (The anatas type of TiO, is a
different cristalline modification which is less abrasive and
therefore preferably used in fibers). Biggest supplier of ore is
Australia.

There are two basic processes to purify the ores into the clean
white TiO for industrial use: the sulfate process operating
mainly with Ilmenite and the chloride process mainly using
Rutile as raw material. The sulfate process has a high
environmental impact by the necessity for disposal or treatment
(e. g. burning) of diluted sulfuric acid. Recently built new
plants therefore use the chloride process technology
(exceptions: India and Malaysia).

EEC-Countries (except England and France) have initiated
significant changes in the treatment of effluent created through
sulfate pigment production.

The demand for TiO is directly related to the growth of the
economy which has, as we all know, boomed during the recent
years.

In 1989 the worldwide consumption reached 2.91 million tons. The
major applications (Figure 1, Ref. 1) for TiO, are:
