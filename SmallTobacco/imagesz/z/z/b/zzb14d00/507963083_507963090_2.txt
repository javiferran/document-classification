plastics (including fibers) 14 % (0.41 million tons)
paper 14 % (0.41 million tons)
other 11 % (0.32 million tons)

The share used in cigarette filter tow production (450 000 tons
of tow in 1989) is about 3 200 tons and equals to 0.1 % of the
global consumption.

Today most of the Tio produced (66 %) is still used in the
highly industrialized countries of the United States and Western
Europe (Figure 2, Ref. 1).

The biggest consumption growth rates, however, are expected in
the other countries of the world with the highest increase in
the application for plastics (Figure 3, Ref. 1).

There are numerous producers for TiO. around the world, the
market however is dominated by only a few (Figure 4, Ref. 2).

Du Pont, Tioxide, SCM and NL Chemicals (Kronos) account for a
production figure of 1.81 million tons which represent over 60 %
of the total market.

COMPARATIVE TEST

In 1988 a Japanese patent application (SHO-63-309173) was
issued, claiming a Filter Tow without T40,.

It was pointed out that the absence of TiO. would simplify the
process of tow spinning and filtermaking and, most important for
the industrie, would improve the taste of filter cigarettes.
