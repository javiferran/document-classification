At the CORESTA meeting in Interlaken, Switzerland, in September
1989 RHODIA initiated a collaborative test to evaluate the taste
improvements as claimed in the Japanese patent application.

Ten companies being present at that CORESTA meeting agreed in
participating in a collaborative test (Figure 5).

In September and October 1989 these companies received sample
filter rods made by RHODIA to the following specification
(Figure 6).

By April 1990 feedback from 6 of the participating laboratories
has been received (Figure 7).

All laboratories have produced at least one brand cigarettes for
further evaluations using the filter rods supplied by RHODIA.

Smoke analysis has been performed according to CORESTA
standards. The comparison of PMWNF (Particulate Matter Water and
Nicotine Free), Nicotine and Carbon Monoxide in the smoke of the
test cigarettes shows no significant difference dependant on the
Tid, content of the filter rods (Figure 8 and 9).

So the removal of TiO, does not influence the mainstream
Geliveries.

Four companies carried out smoke tests which were the main
objective of the comparison.

Conditions of the panel tests varied from company to company but
were always in accordance with approved standards.

In three cases no taste differences between the cigarettes
having filters without TiO, and the cigarettes having filters
with Tio could be determined although the panelists knew what
changes had been made to the different cigarettes.
