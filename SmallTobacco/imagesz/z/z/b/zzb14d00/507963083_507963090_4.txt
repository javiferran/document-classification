One smoke panel pointed out some smaller differences between the
two cigarette types. They called the cigarettes having filters
without TiO. sharper, drier, more irritating etc. However, the
assessment of the panel was that the taste difference was
probably due to the fact that filters and tobacco blend did not
totally match, i. e. the tobacco rod originally had been
designed for a different filter type.

So far the test results received show no evidence against the
removal of the pigment TiO. from cigarette filters. Before doing
so, all possible effects would have to be studied in a much
closer evaluation.

The comments the participants made to the visual aspects of
TiO -free filter rods were as expected. They were called "off-
white", "discoloured", “darker”, "not fresh" and so on.

However, after the first or second puff of the cigarette the
visual colour difference between the filter tips with Tid, and
without TiO, disappear almost completely.
