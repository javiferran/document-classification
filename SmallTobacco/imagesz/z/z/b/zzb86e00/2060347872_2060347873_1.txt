While we do not anticipate any significant changes to production schedules, we will
monitor the situation and issue a production schedule for you effective with the November
posting.

We are also looking at the issue of moving posting cycles to the 15th of the month, and will
forward you a recommendation shortly.

If you have any questions about these issues, please let me know.
