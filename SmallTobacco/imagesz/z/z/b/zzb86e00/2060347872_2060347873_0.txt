SUBJECT: Revi Incremental Production Costs/Paper to Vinyl

The attached details the revised incremental "production" costs associated with a conversion
to vinyl for the various PM bulletin pools. The additional costs for transportation and art
(less separation savings) are now included. Importantly, costs have actually declined
slightly for the Corporate pool versus those presented on Monday, while Marlboro costs
have increased nominally. ~

Separation charges, which average $5,000 per design, will be eliminated when converting
to vinyl production. The savings applies only to the Corporate pool, given that Marlboro
separation charges were included in the Marcann paper printing costs. As a result, minor
increases in transportation costs due to heavier weight for vinyl was more than offset by
significant savings due to the elimination of separation charges for the Corporate pool.
Below is a breakdown of the revised incremental costs per unit per cycle for both pools.

.. INCREMENTAL COSTS/U NIT/CY CLE

Marlboro ~ Original Revised
14x 48 $ 78 $ 90

20 x 60 281 312
Corporate

19.6 x 48 119 101

20 x 60 69 - 282

Note that it is now cost effective to produce the 20 x 60 Corporate pool on vinyl vs. paper !

Fiscal 1994 and full year '95 revised incremental production costs for vinyl are outlined on
the attached. Total incremental Marlboro pool production costs for fiscal 1994 totals
$57,000 while the Corporate pool totals an incremental $21,000 for fiscal '94 (or $5m per
brand for the 4 cycles).

Assuming brand approval, we will proceed with the conversion effective
with the November posting for Virginia Slims in the Corporate pool and for
Marlboro in the 14 x 48 and 20 x 60 pools. We will also coordinate viewing for
the vinyl/paper “test” which will be available for viewing in Maspeth, Queens during the
week of June 27th.
