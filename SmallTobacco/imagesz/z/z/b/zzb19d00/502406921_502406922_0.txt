Dear Mr. ¥illiams:
~ *Potitical Conventions and Elections" and the Humidor

Pouch, even though you did not react favorably to them is no

reason why I may not yet work out a plan agreeable to you

Without going into detail, I want to say that part of
the idea I have is an entirely new copy slant for Camel
Cigarettes. A copy note every bit as powerful as the Humidor
Pack and "I'd walk a mile for a Camel,

If that is so, and I assure youit ie, undoubtedly you
will be interested in knowing what it is.

It will enable Camel to again capitalize the times -
with a new, sparkling, powerful and dramatic copy angle -
one that fits Camel's like a glove. ,

The idea, of which the copy note is part, can be
adopted to your present radio presentation, without dis-
turbing it, in such a manner as to hold the Camel Radio
audience for a full hovrafter you have left the air. It
provides a hook on which to hang your pregram.

I heave gone to considerable trouble and expense to
lay the idea out so that it can be quickly visualized, and
I believe, instantly appreciated, for what it is - a valuable
and important advertising idea,

Therefore, I am going to ask if you wontt be kind
enough to advise me by wire, if you will give the tine to
look the presentation over, if I mail it to you for your
quick reaction.

Cont t uiss this, Vr. Willians, believe me, it is one

TES GENT LEON STRESS, ALS DENTS. AND OTHE DELAYS UNAVO LABLE OP EEYOND OR CONTROL.
