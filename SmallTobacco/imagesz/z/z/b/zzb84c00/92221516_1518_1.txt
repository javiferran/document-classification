if New Jersey
didn’t Exist,
Saturday Night
Live Would
Have to

Invent it

Bad enough that truckers
with toxic waste and
mobsters with-dead bodies
dump on the

Garden State—now
TV.comedians are

doing it too

 

By Gregory Bayan
There | was, minding my own business
in front of the TV set, watching The To-
night Show, when Johnny Carson held up
a photograph of a straw-hatted slob
clutehing a banana. According to Carson,
the photo represented “what the Statue
of Liberty looks like naw that New Jersey
owns It.”

LATER THAT SAME EVENING. ..

"Peaple last night, they're trying to get
from New York City home to New Jersey
and there's some kind of explosion ...
power lines are down—and they couldn't
get there. So the New York Transit Au-
thority says, ‘Well, OK, on the negative
side, these people didn't get to go fo New
Jersey. However, on the pasitive side these
people didn't get to go to New versey’.”

—David Letterman on’ Late Nighi.

Et tu, David? &t tu? Sure, everyone
loves to dump on New Jersey—stand-up
comics, iruckers with loads of toxic waste,
mobsters with dead bodies to dispose of,

| even aliens from outer space. As far back

ag Orson Welles’ infamous 1938 radio
broadcast of “The War of the Worlds,” the
alectronic thedia betrayed a distinct anti-
Jersey bias: Welles’ fictitious Martians
destroyed New Jersey first. But it is tel-
evision that has played a peerless role
in making New Jersey the Rodney Dan-
gerfield of the Union. If the Garden State |
didn't exist, someone on Saturday Night
Live would have to invent it
“Where are you from—New Jersey?
What exit?”
—Billy Crystal, as former SNL come-
dian Buddy Young Jr. !
Mr, Young is referring to the New Jersey
Turnpike. This heavily traveled asohalt
gaurilet symbolizes the Nation’s most
densely populated state. A surfeit of toxic |
waste compounds our image problem. i
this is New Jersey, can you Imagine what
Old Jersey was like? But seriously, 7o'ks, |
let's be fair. Overall, my home state is a
swell place to live. work and play. It]
deserves more respect. Really.
