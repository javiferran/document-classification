We balieve our laboratory research can support tha Super$lims .
advertising claim of 70% leas smoke from the lit end of the cigarette as

compared to the leading 100 mm brand, and 60% less smoke from the lit end as
compared to Capri,

This research utilizes an instrument which measures the amount
(intensity) of light which passes through the smoke plume of eight
cigarettes under laboratory conditions, The light source is a Helium-Neon
Laser operating at a wave length of 543.5 nanometers.

The measured value for the Virginia Slims SuperSlims cigarette used in

the advertising photography is equivalent to the measured value expected for
the commercially manufactured product.
