Corporate Center of Toxicology
Weekly Highlights - Week Ending June 19, 1987

A review of pesticide regulations and regulatory toxicology as
described in a Council” fer.Agricultural Science and Technology
(CAST) document was prepared by. Dr. Robert Suber. The CAST
document provides a very simpl c view of these areas
without defining both the strengths and weaknesses of science
and regulations. Risk assessment as currently used by the
Environmental Protection ~aAgency is only a part of the
scientific data needed to interpret risk and _ safety
considerations of pesticides. The CAST document had been
prepared to explain technical aspects and to provide general
background information on pesticides following the recent
National Academy of Science report on pesticides and risks.

The minutes of the quarterly Center meeting was distributed.
The most recent developments of Proposition 65 in California
were discussed. A court -»pinion requires the California
Governor to list over 200 compounds which are considered
animal or human carcinogens/teratogens. The recent National
Academy of Science report on pesticides was also reviewed.
The report provides a theoretical approach to oncogenic risks
due to pesticides and suggests that EPA review/require
additional data on selected pesticides. The National
Toxicology Program is preparing to test limonene and black
pepper in bioassays. Del Monte is currently evaluating the
use of lower sulfite concentrations on dried fruit.
