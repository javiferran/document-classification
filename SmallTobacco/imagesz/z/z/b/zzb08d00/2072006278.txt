RE: WCTU Study

DATE: April 2, 1997

 

Remember a long time ago when I was going to send this to you? Lo and behold, here it
is.

I think you’ll see some very interesting information in here. I found it fascinating and the
comparisons are evident.

Of particular note is the fact that the information was compiled from the Anti-Saloon
League Museum right here in Westerville -- a suburb of Columbus. Also, Oberlin College
in northern Ohio maintains a comprehensive collection of historical documents related to
the Women’s Chirstian Temperance Union.

As I mentioned, David Laufer and Chan had discussed this angle for possible media
activity a while back and that’s when Jim Underwood (who works for us as a researcher

for projects) initially began his search.

Please review and let me know your thoughts. I still think this has excellent story
potential on a local and national basis.
