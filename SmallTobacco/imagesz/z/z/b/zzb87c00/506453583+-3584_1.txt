‘Burn Rate

 

-—

 

R&D recommended QA consider adoption of Burn Rate as a
standard QA method. Burn rate is typically used as a .

. _ troubleshooting analysis. Burn rate will not be included in

“ URP product specifications. At this point in VRP
development I cannot build a strong case to support

GA adoption of Burn Rate as 4 standard method unless burn
rate presents itself as a significant problem to the
consumer, a problem which could not be addressed by better
control of the cigarette paper and blend properties which
can be sontrolied before cigarettes are made. QA will
identify the cost of fabrication, installation and ‘
operation of a burn rate apparatus.

R&D Staffing

Anderson has been reassigned to the project and is the
