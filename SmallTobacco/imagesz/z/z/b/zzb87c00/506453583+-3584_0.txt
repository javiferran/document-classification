April i8 ~ April 22, 1988

To: Mr. B. M. Wagner

SUBJECT: Project URP Weekly Status

Central Laboratory Services representatives attended VRP status
meetings 4/19 & 4/20. The meetings are summarized as follows:

ars .
. Cigarette Paper

R&D will address the need for a specification on Sodiun

Acetate in VRP paper. Sodium Acetate is found in VRP

Paper as a result of the bleaching process.

The presence of Sodium Acetate causes a discrepancy between
the method Ecusta uses for Potassium Acetate and the method
RJR GA and RJR R&D use. Ecusta's method for detection of
Potassium Acetate reports both Potassium and Sodium Acetate

- as Potassium Acetate. GA is able to to test for and report
Potassium Acetate, Sodium Acetate or Total Acetate. The
specifications as currently written addresses only Potassium
Acetate levels.

The April 12th shipment of VRP paper contained nq Potassium
Acetate but had signifigant amounts of Sodium Acetate.

Visible Sidestream Apparatus/Measurenment
The Visible Sidestream Apparatus is to be delivered to QA
4/21. Operator training and correlation testing will begin
as soon as the apparatus is operational. .

R&D is to provide written test methods to QA prior to
analysis of test market product.

The test market product will be jointly tested by
R&D and GA. Both the 85 and 100 mm brand styles will be
split, with each lab testing half of the samples.

Brand R&D has requested QA assistance in measuring visible
sidestream smoke on prototypes. QA will provide assistance
to R&D as provided on other analytical methods, i.e. QA will
assist R&D with overflow prototype testing, provided the
additional analyses will not put OA in an overtime
situation, ,

Manufacturing Start-up
Manufacturing Start-up is scheduled for May 24.
