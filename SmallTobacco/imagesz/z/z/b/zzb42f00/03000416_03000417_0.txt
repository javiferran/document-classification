MEMORANDUM

TO: The Members of the Executive Committee

FROM: Samuel D. Chilcote, ee Se

By a vote of 14 to 11, Rep. Waxmanâ€™s (D-CA) Subcommittee on
Health and the Environment approved H.R. 3434, the "Smokefree
Environment Act of 1993," at a markup session this morning. The
measure, as amended, would ban smoking in every building in the
United States that is regularly entered by 10 or more people at
least once a week. Bars and restaurants, private clubs, tobacco
shops, and jails and prisons are exempt, as amended.

As anticipated, Waxman offered two amendments that constituted a
substitute. One amendment, negotiated with the National Council
of Chain Restaurants, pertains to citizen enforcement; the other
exempts tobacco shops, bars and restaurants, and jails and
prisons.

Rep. Upton (R-MI) offered an amendment to exempt "private clubs
while in use for social or fraternal activities that are not open
to the public." All amendments were adopted by voice vote. A
copy of the bill with final amendments is enclosed.
