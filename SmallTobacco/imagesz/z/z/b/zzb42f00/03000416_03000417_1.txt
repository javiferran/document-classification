Before passage, the measure was debated at length. The
Subcommittee’s ex-officio member Rep. Moorhead (by virtue of
being the full Committee’s ranking Republican Member) expressed
strong opposition to the measure. Moorhead specifically cited
the undue burden the bill would place on the federal court
systen.

Rep. Hall indicated that a "states rights" amendment, which had
been discussed with the chairman, may be offered in the full
committee.

The bill will next be considered by the full Energy and Commerce
Committee. I will keep you apprised.
