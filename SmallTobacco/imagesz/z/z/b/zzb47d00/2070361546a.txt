Media Outlet:Editorial Humor

This guy is the managing editor for a publication in Brookline, MA where there is a severe
smoking ban being proposed and the restuarants are really angry. His paper has been
supporting the restaurants with editorials and now would like to donate a 1/4 page ad. They
want to put their money where their mouths are so to speak according to the editor. They've
gotten our smoking issues brochure and would like permission to reprint the courtesy ad.
They feel it says everything that needs to be said. They need to hear from us by 4:30 ish,

Ellen: Any problem with this?
