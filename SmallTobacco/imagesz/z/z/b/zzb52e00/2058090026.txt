“Mr. EM. Schaaf
«RB. Seligman
-Parliament History

Pursuant to our conversation, you will find attached several pages of a
jor changes in the

report issued by the Research Center concerned with ma
Parliament brand since the early 1960's. Please check
and Tet me know if there are errors or deficiencies,

As we noted in our conversation, interest is centered
would be obvious to a consumer; for example, recess vs

in tipping length or filter construction, Single vs. dual filters and

length of filters,

Most important would be to suoply information prior to 1961 which,I trust,

will be in the Manufacturing Department's files.

Finally, a reminder that I have a deadline of December 13 to have the infor-_

mation in my hands.
