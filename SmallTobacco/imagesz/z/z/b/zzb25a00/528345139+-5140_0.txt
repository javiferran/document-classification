Weekly Report ending June 7.

This weck J drafted letters for those activists in Jowa who committed to write letters on
the FDA, As you may recall we had 15 people agree to do this. As always, pcople
promise and then sit on the letter for days on end so J had to do quite a bit of follow-up.

Thus far we have copics of letters from the following people:

David Payer - former candidate for legislature and small business owner
Jim Raife - health food store owner

Jim Kuhlman - health care professional

Todd Rector - Auditor

Mary Rector - Athritis sufferer

Michael Bennett - former candidate for legislature and real estate agent

The subjects of the letters covered a broad range. They included Mary Rector's inability
lo purchase DMSO, the FDA's attempt to regulae tobacco, the FDA's policing of medical
devices, the regulation of the health food industry, the regulation of vitamins and drug
approval. I tried to vary the topics as much as possible.

Letters to the editor were also sent to the DesMoines Register covering the same topics. I
expect to have copies of the remaining letters back to me by the end of the week, I'm
faxing you copies of the letters I do have now. I plan to do the same thing for Illinois next
week,

Anti-activist Jesse Brown will be in KC tomorrow through Saturday as part of a program
sponsored by the American Stop Smoking Intervention Study, a tobacco-control
