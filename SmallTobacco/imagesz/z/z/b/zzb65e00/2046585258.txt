Dr. Elders attacks
the demon weed

Surgeon General of the United

States, did not castrate her hus-
band ortry to cripple an Olympic ath-
lete. Had she done so, the press con-
ference she held last week to
announce yet another escalation in
the federal war against smoking and
indeed against the demon weed in all
its forms might have enjoyed some
momentary notice in the nation’s
press. As it is, however, all Dr. Elders
threatens to do is strip the country of
yet another level of liberty, and that
seems not to be worthy of much pub-
lic attention.

That’s a shame, because of all the
wacky animals in the Clinton zoo,
Dr. Elders is surely the wackiest,
and whatever she says is sure to
split a rib. Her nutty comments

IE too bad that Dr. Joyce Elders,

legalization of real
drugs. .

rival even those of Vice President Al
Gore, who has run the gamut of
boobism from his tour of Thomas
Jefferson’s home at Monticello last
year, when he was unable to identi-
fy a bust of the third President of the
United States, to his mistranslation
a couple of weeks ago of the motto
“FE Pluribus Unum” on the Great
Seal. Mr. Gore thinks the Latin
expression means “From One,
Many,” though in fact it means the
exact opposite, “From Many, One.”

Yet so far Mr. Gore’s bloopers,
unlike those for which Dr. Elders has
become notorious, have not endan-
gered liberty and public decency.
Only last month, the Surgeon Gener-
al earned a rebuke from the zoo mas-
ter-in-chief himself when she rumi-
nated on the virtues of legalizing
drugs. But last week she preached on
the evils of tobacco, and perhaps the
highlight of her sermon was her
deathless insight that “Any form of
tobacco. — smoked, chewed, spit or
inhaled — is lethal.”

 

Samuel Francis, a columnist for The
Washington Times, is nationally syndi-
cated. His column appears here Tues-
day and Friday. :

 

That, of course, is simply non-
sense. There are untold millions of
people who smoke, chew or inhale
tobacco and don’t die from it. There
are people who
use tobacco a lit-
tle. There are peo-
ple who use it fora
while and give it
up. There even
are people who
smoke it heavily
for decades and
die quietly at 93
when they fall
down the kitchen

“4

Samuel stairs. For none of
. these peopie is the
Francis use of tobacco
“lethal” or even

harmful.

The purpose of the press confer-
ence was to arouse a somnolent citi-
zenry to action, and it was only a pre-
lude to the surgeon general’s
forthcoming magnum opus on smok-
ing, due in February. While Dr.
Elders was blasting the tobacco
industry, ex-President Jimmy Carter,
whom Dr. Elders dragged forth as an
ornament for her performance,
urged a $2-per-pack tax increase on
cigarettes to help keep “3,000 chil-
dren from trying cigarettes for the
first time each day” Whenever you
hear the word “children? you should
quietly rip the cellophane on your
pack of Chesterfields.

Then Dr. Antonia Novello, Sur-
geon General under President Bush,
unbosomed the bizarre sentiment
that tobacco is “the least regulated
consumer product” in the country.

But it’s already illegal in most
states for minors to buy tobacco prod-
ucts, and smoking is banned in all air-
planes and many airports, restau-
rants, malls and public buildings, on
top of outlawed cigarette advertising
on TV and radio, compulsory warning
labels and taxes that are already pro-
hibitive. For Dr. Novello to pronounce
that tobacco is “the least regulated”
product in the country is — once
again — an outright lie.

The plan is to push for virtual
prohibition of tobacco by the year
2000, and the Coalition on Smoking
or Health, which also bellied up to
the Surgeon General’s pulpit last
week, had the details. The Food and
Drug Administration should ban
the claims that low-tar and low-
nicotine cigarettes are less danger-
ous than the good stuff. The Feder-
al Trade Commission should ban
‘Joe Camel” ads that supposedly
entice children to smoke. The
Transportation Department should
make international flights smoke-

less. Congress should impose the
$2-a-pack tax’and give the FDA full
authority to regulate all tobacco
products, and so on.

The irony of this gala unveiling of
yet another therapeutic war to be
waged by the federal leviathan is that
it comes from the same woman who
has just counseled the legalization of

real drugs. Since Dr. Elders’ own son |!

is facing felony drug charges and her
husband owns a house in Little Rock
notorious as the hang-out of a whole-
some collection of youths known as
the “8 Ball Posse,” suspected of drug-
dealing themselves, it ought to strike
most Americans as just a bit ripe for
this sanctimonious loudmouth to blus-
ter lies and banalities about tobacco
even as she croons the virtues of
legalizing dangerous substances.

But then, the American ruling class
has never been known to stint itself in
the pursuit of other peoples’ vices,
especially when there’s power to be
had in the chase. If nothing else, Dr.
Elders’ unnoticed press conference
was a pure specimen of what that
class is up to and how it plans to
achieve it — unless the citizens can
tear themselves away from Lorena
Bobbitt and Tonya Harding long
enough to protect what remains of
their freedom.
