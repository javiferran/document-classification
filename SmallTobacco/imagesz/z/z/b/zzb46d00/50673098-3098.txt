RE: Case number 6705
Dear Dr. Hashim,

Enclosed please find the original and 6 copies of my application to the Council for Tobacco
Research titled, 'Growth factor-stimulated transcription of the MCP-1 "slow"
immediate-early gene by novel 5' enhancer elements.’ This proposal requests 3 years
of funding from the Council and describes experiments which will characterize two critical control
elements operative in growth factor-stimulated transcription of the MCP-1 immediate-early gene.
The MCP-1 gene (for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) codes for the potent CC chemokine
MCP-1 which hus been shown to play important rolcs in the initiation and progression of
atherosclerotic lesions. The MCP-1 protein can also be used in the adjuvant treatment of a number
of malignancies.

Success in the areas discussed in this application will yield new insights into novel signal
transduction pathways as well as a number of specific (DNA and protein) targets, important in
transcriptional control, for future rational drug design.

Thank you for your consideration of these materials.
