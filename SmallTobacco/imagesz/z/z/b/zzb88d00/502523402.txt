Subject: Comparison of Silastic 731RTV Date: June 26, 1974
and 732RTV Sealants

To: Mr. E. L. Hall From: Larry A. Lyerly
Machine Shop Research Department

Samples of the two sealants were removed from the tubes and allowed to
cure for several days. They were burned in special sample cells for analysis
by infrared spectroscopy. The pyrolysis products from the two samples appeared
to be the same although variations in intensities of the products occurred.

The infrared spectra of the vapor phases suggest the presence of small amounts
of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and monoxide, acetic acid, and with somewhat
larger concentrations of silicones. The residue after burning appears to be
essentially silicon dioxide (sand).

During our conversation about the sealants, you mentioned that 731RTV had
been approved for your use as a gasket material. Accordingly, the results of
our analyses indicate that the 732RTV should be equally acceptable. I recommend
that neither material be used in places where contamination in tobacco would
likely occur. For example, use on moving machine parts where wear would result
in probable contamination in tobacco should be avoided.

Attached are data sheets received from Dow Corning regarding the status
of Silastic 732RTV under Federal Food and Drug Administration Regulations and
the National Sanitation Foundation. Note that when thoroughly cured and washed,
732RTV has been approved under FDA Regulation No. 121.2562 dealing with rubber
articles intended for repeated use in contact with food. Under the NSF Code,
732RTV has been approved for use in the splash zone and 731RTV in the food zone.
