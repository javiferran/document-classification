Dear Carolyn, | expect that we will be in a position to put together a Phase
1 report in about two months - if we can complete the two ongoing groups

without a set back. By that time, we should have completed two pilot groups.

If you prefer that we include data from a third group, it will take longer.

The earliest we could start a third group is in January. The Phase 1 report
would include the results of the focus group, a description of our Baseline
and Follow-up Questionnaires, a description of the smoking cessation group
program, and the initial outcome of two (or three) pilot groups. We will

also describe our recruitment strategies and lessons learned from Phase 1.
Have a nice flight and great holiday. Best regards, Norman
