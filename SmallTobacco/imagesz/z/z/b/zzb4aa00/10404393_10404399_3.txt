Table 2 shows the meah values of selected variables at
Examination | according to skin color. The dark group had
higher average systolic and diastolic blood pressure. lower
serum cholesterol and fasting triglycerides, and similar aver-
age blood glucose. Each skin color group reported smoking
the same quantity of cigareties per day. Although not shown,
heart rate and hematocrit were similar in the two skin color
groups. The dark group was only one year older on the aver-
age than the light group. but this difference was statistically
significant. Income. education. and occupation leve! were all
lower in the dark group.

The pepulation was queried on antihypertensive drug
usc, including diuretics, and 18 per cent of the dark and 14
per cent of the light group were reported to be using anti-
hypertensive medication. If those individuals taking anti-
hypertensive drugs are removed from the analysis, the dif-
ferences by color s.own in Table 2 are virtually unchanged.
Since diastolic blood pressure was only slightly higher in the
dark group. all subsequent Tables will present the results us-
ing systolic pressure. Simple correlation coefficients be-
tween systolic blood pressure and specific vanables are
shown in Table 3. As would be expected, relative weight and
age had the strongest association with systolic pressure. No
important association with blood pressure was apparent for
any of the socioeconomic variables studied (income, educa-
lion, and occupation).

Multiple discriminant tunction analysis was run, using
systolic blood pressure ano the other characteristics as pos-
sible variables to maximize the discrimination between the
two populations of light and dark skin. Results of these anal-
yses are shown in Table 4. In this particular multivariate
modeling. there were significant differences for systolic pres-
sure. serum cholesterol. physical activity. age. education,
and occupation between the two skin color groups when all
of the variables were taken mie acceunt. That is, systolic
blood pressure was still higher in the dark group when con-

trolling for the fact that this group was from a lower so-
cioeconomic tevel. This is not too surprising in light of the
previous Tables which show virtually no association be-
tween blood pressure and income, education. or occupation.

The results in Table 4 indicate that there were other im-
portant differences between the light and dark groups. First.
serum cholesterol tended to be lower and physical activity
levels were higher in the dark group. Secondly, the measures
of education and occupation were stalistically significant and
lower in the dark group. Triglycerides were included in this
multivariate model for the subgroup that camt to the exami-
nation in a fasting state (Table 4). These resulis show that the
lower triglycerides in the dark group were statistically signif.
icant when the other variables were taken into account.

Looking more specifically at the determinants of blood
pressure, a multiple linear Tegression model ivas also fitted,
and the resulting coefficients are shown in Table 5. Systolic
blood pressure was regressed on skin color, serum cholester-
ol. blood glucose, relative weight, physical activity, ciga-
rettes smoked, age. and the socioeconomic variables. Skin
color was significantly associated with systolic blood pres-
sure when the other variables were taken into account.
There are. however, other variables which were significantly
associated with systolic pressure and which had a much
greater impact than skin color: age and relative weight were
the dominant variables. After adjustment for the specified
vanables, the estimated difference in systolic blood pressure
between hpht and dark was still about 4 mm He (coefficient
is 4.0436 and skin color is coded 0 or I. light or dark respec:
tively). The inability of these parameters to adequately €x-
plan the variability of blood pressure is seen by the R-
squared value of 0.12, or only 12 per cent of SBP variability
was explained by these variables.

The Heart Study has only two and one-half years of
morbidity aud mortality follow-np on these men with skin
color determinations yielding estimates of incidence rates
