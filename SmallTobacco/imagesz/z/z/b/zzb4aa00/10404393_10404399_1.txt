| Summer Program on Controlled Release Technology Offered at MIT |

A one-week summer program on “Controller Release Technology: Polymeric Deliverv Systems
for Drugs. Pesticides, and Foods” will be offered August 3-7, 1987 at the Massachusetts Institute of

Technology.

Techniques for improving the administration of chemicals and drugs are becoming increasingly
important from both an economic and health standpoint. The use of polymers to contro} the release of
these chemicals has emerged as an important new area of technology, spanning many fields which
include pharmaceutical, food. agriculture. and household applications.

The MIT program will explore recent advances in controlled release technology and cover polymer
systems as they relate to achieving appropnate design of controlled release formulations. Topics to be

discussed include:

@ Fundamental Principles of Controlled Drug Release
© Pharmaceutical. Agricultural, and Food Applications

® Fabrication Techniques

© Diffusion of Drugs in Polymers. and Polymer Chemistry and Physics Relating to Drug Release
The course will be oresented by faculty at MIT and other universities currently active in the topics
to be covered. For further information. wnte to: Director of Summer Session Office. Room £19-356,
