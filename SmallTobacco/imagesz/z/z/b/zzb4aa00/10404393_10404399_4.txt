Discussion

Blood pressure studies in Puerto Rico can be traced
back to 1948. when an attempt was made 10 obtain blood
pressures on an island-wide sample of the population aged
17-84.23 Racial classification in thal study was made using
the von Luschan tiles for skin color, as well as other mor-
phological characteristics. When controlling for age. weight
groups. nutritional class. climatological class. and SOTIOECO-
nomic class. there were no differences in blood pressures
ben-een Blacks and Whites for those who had always lived
in the rural areas. This 1948 study did not analyze the urban
population.

The current study of urban men in the Puerto Rico
Heart Health Program has shown higher average systolic
blood pressure values than men with light skin, a situation
similar to that found in the continental United States. How-
ever, while this difference in the Puerto Rico group is statisti-
cally significant, its magnitude is relatively small, only 4mm
He. There was only a small diflerence observed for diastolic
blood pressure (1 mm Hes. Multivariate analy sis in the pre-
sent study shows that the higher observed average blood
pressure in the dark group is not due to age. a vancty of
characteristics including relative weight, or the socine-o-
nomic factors studied.

Within Puerto Rico. the socioeconomic variables mea-
sured are not related to blood pressure, but they are related
to other coronary risk factors (Figure 1). There is increasing
serum cholesterol and relative weight with individuals of
higher educational attainment. Mean values of systolic and
dastaliy blood pressure are fairly constant at all levels of
education. Figure t also shows that al each level of educa-

lion. systolic pressure is higher in the dark color group thar
the light. The inability of the socioeconomic factors 10 ex:
plain the Mood pressure difference does not rule cut the in
volvement of psychosocial processes. There are, of course
other psychosocial or environmental factors and cultural be:
havior which are not adequately measured by education, in
come, or occupation. These alternative hypotheses includ:
lifelong differences in dietary practices such as salt intake
differences in family interactions such as marital dis
satisfaction. differences in daily stress, or differences in goa
achievements not directly measured by education, occupa
tion, or income.

From a 24-hour dietary recall collected al the initial ex
amination, data have been analyzed to determine if there ar
major dietary differences between the light and dark groups
There are some differences as noted in Table 6. but thes«
differences are not large. There is slightly less fat and mon
carbohydrates consumed in the dark group, while caffein
and cholesterol consumption in this group are Sess.

Jn addition to blood pressure differences, the Puert:
Rico study describes other major and possibly more impor
tant differences in coronary risk factors between skin colo
groups. In particular, serum cholesterol and fasting tri
glycerides are lower. and physical activity levels are highe
in the dark group.

Differences in tipoprotein measurements betweet
Blacks and Whites have been observed elsewhere. In thi
Evans County study.24 Blacks were found to have lowe
serum tnglycerides and lower low density lipoprotein cho
lesterol (LDL-C) than Whites after controlling for tota
serum cholesterol, age. and sex. Blacks also had higher val
ues of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). In
similar analysis of the Cincinnati Lipid Research Clinic pop
viation, plasma HDL-C was higher in Blacks and plasma tri
glycerides were lower after controlling for total cholesterol
ape. and sex?
