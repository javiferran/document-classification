Re: Engle, etal. v. RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company, et al.

Dear Ms. Giachino:

Thank you for your May 10, 2000 letter to William S. Ohlemeyer.
Because of my past involvement in the Engle litigation, your letter
has been referred to me for response.

For a variety of reasons and on a variety of grounds, Philip Morris
Incorporated argued strenuously and repeatedly in Engle against
the discovery of any information regarding Philip Morris
Incorporated’s consumer lists. Despite Philip Morris
Incorporated’s and other defendant's objections, the Date County
Judge presiding in Engle ordered that certain consumer list
information be provided to class counsel.

In light of the court's ruling, counsel for Philip Morris Incorporated
then took steps intended to maintain the confidentiality interest of
Philip Morris Incorporated and its consumers including:

1. Specifying detailed procedurdity which no name, address
or other identifying information would be produced to
class counsel (see attached April 24, 2000 and May 9, 2000
letters to class counsel);
