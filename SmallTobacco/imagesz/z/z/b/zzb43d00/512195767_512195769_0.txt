o AMF Filling Capacity Instrument

An AMF representative assisted in the performance evalua~ |
tion of the AMF in-line filling.capacity instrument lo-
cated in G-13 Plant 63. Four different blends over a
range of filling capacity values from 450 to 900 ml1./100
gm. were measured with the standard RJR filling capacity
methods. Mid-range filling capacity measurements were
acceptable, but range limit measurements indicated the
need for instrument adjustments. Software and instrument
setting were changed to improve the correlation between
the AMF unit and the RJR method. Testing will continue to
confirm instrument adjustments and to verify correlation
with production filling capacity values.

Optimum Strip and Cut Filler Particle Size

The RDM for the SCOPE Phase II making tests is ready for
review.

The cutting, verification tests which will use blends of
three grades of burley, flue-cured and then add turkish
blend are being defined. Screening of the burley for this
test will be complete in mid-September and the flue-cured
screening will continue until November.

Processing begins this week at the J. I. Miller Stemmery,
Wilson, N.C. to produce the special large size domestic
strip for a SCOPE factory test.
