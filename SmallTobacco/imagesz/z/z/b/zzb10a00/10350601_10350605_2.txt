OXyeeW per amole of nicotine, However. a new absorption
mevimum at 290 my was observed (Fig. 2). | These results supe
portal the chromatugmphic evidence for the temporary ac.
cumulation of intermediates, and showed that the first two of
these substances could be ensily distinguished from one another
and from nicotine by means of their absorption in the ultraviolet.

Oridation of Nicotine by Nmmonison Sulfate Frartions —By
fractionating the enide extmet with ammonium sulfate in
increments of 20 per cent of suturation With respert to ame
monium sulfate, two Preparstions were obtained which oxidized
nicotine when supplemented with methylene blue, Although
fractionation did net lead tea lange inerease in specific activity,
it did recover a major portion of the initial erude activity (Table
IV). What is more important. freetionation with ammonium
sulfate separated the material nesponsilte for the initial ovidative
step from the subscquent ones (Fig. 3).

The 20 to 40 fraction, when dissolved jn haffer, gave aun
intensely vellow sulution. It oxidized nicotine in the presence
of methylene blue, and ovidation ceased after the consumption
of 0.5 umole of oxygen per umole of nicotine (F ig. 3).

When nicotine and methylene blne were present an excess. the
rate of nicotine ovidation was Jimited by the concentration of
enzyme protein over the experimentally determined range of
from 0.11 mg. to 1.) mg. per mi In the presence of an bveess
of nicotine and of enzyme, methylene blue limited the mte of
oxidation up to a concentration of 250 >¢ 10°4 as, in reasonably
close agreement with that observed with chide extracts. In
the presence of an excess of enzyme and of methviene blue.
nicotine limited the rate of oxidation up to a concentration of
approximately 35 x 10-9 at (Fig. 4).

After the oxidation of nivotine by the 20 to 40 fraction ceased),
the ultraviolet aleorption spectrum and the chromatographic
behavior of the reaction mixture were identical to that observed
at the 0.3 smole ovygen rate change when nicotine was onidized
hy a crude extract.

The 40 to 60 frection was obtained as a light green pellet.
Relatively concentrated solutions of this fraction were deep
grecn in color when dissolved in 0.01 31 potassium phosphate
buffer, pH 7. This fraction oxidized) nicotine only in the pres-
ence of methylene blue, with the consumption of } ymale of
ONYgen per amole of nicotine (Fig. 3). At the end of the ovxidu-
tion, the reaction mixture had the ultraviolet uhsurption spec-
tram and the chromatogruphir properties: present at the | amole
oxygen rate change obtained with the crude extract. ‘The 40

both the first and second oxidative steps in nicotine degradation.
