Relaxing Effects of Smoking

These effects of smoking are difficult to demonstrate by exact
tests. It is, however, of possible interest that certain clinical
investigators mention the subject.

As examples may be cited a paper by Conn and Kissane and three
papers by Levy and his associates.

Smoking &s & Reflection

The view that excessive smoking may be a reflection of the
presence in certain types of individuals of increased. predisposition
to cardiovascular disease rather than acting as a cause of such
diseases is held by some research workers,

Not many have explicitly stated this belief but Friedman and his
associates are among those who have done so.

It is well to note, however, that the minor role assigned to
smoking by the large number of workers to whom reference has been made
in the consideration of stress indicates & very definite doubt in their
minds as to whether smoking has significant etiological effects.
