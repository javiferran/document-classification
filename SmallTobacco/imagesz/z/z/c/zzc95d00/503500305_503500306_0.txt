Subject: VANTAGE PACKAGING EXPLORATORY
Dear Howard:

As we discussed by telephone, we are requesting that you conduct
an additional phase of exploratory for VANTAGE packaging. You
should concentrate your work during this phase on VANTAGE Parent
85mm and VANTAGE Excel. Once this phase is successfully completed
we will proceed with translations to our VAT, Ultra Lights, 100's
and Menthol styles. .

As we agreed, your initial presentation to us is scheduled for
12/17. Flats as opposed to comps are the appropriate format for
this presentation; however, they should have a high degree of

finished appearance.

Howard, direction for this next phase does not depart
Significantly from that which guided your previous work. There
are, however, several areas upon which you should place additional
focus in order to achieve the optimal design for VANTAGE. Specif-
ically, you should strive to:

@ Increase the pack's contemporary look.

@ Provide a higher level of quality appearance.

Â® Inject motion and energy into the design, as opposed to a
Static effect.

@ Maintain a strong visual link to current VANTAGE packaging.
Specific design elements which you should address include:

@ Logo treatment which is more contemporary as regards typeface
or position.

e Bulls-eye treatment which is less bold, more tasteful.

@ Elimination of background starkness.
