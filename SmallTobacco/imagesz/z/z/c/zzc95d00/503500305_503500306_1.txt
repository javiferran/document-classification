VANTAGE Excel should be consistent with your design for Parent
VANTAGE. There must be a strong visual link between the designs
such that consumers will readily perceive the "Family" relation-
ship. However, design elements of the Excel packaging should be
developed to impart the following perceptions as compared to the
new Parent packs:

~ more contemporary

- greater appeal to younger adult smokers
- higher quality

- greater flavor delivery

As regards work which you have submitted previously, there
certainly may be approaches which we would reconsider with the
appropriate improvements, such as the “Comet” design. However,
please understand that your exploratory must be broad in its scope
and should produce new options, as opposed to refinements on
existing work.

Howard, if you have any questions regarding this direction, please
feel free to call either Randy or me at any time.

Sincerely,
