a naturally occurring antagonist of IL-1@ and IL-18.

Though originally described as "lymphocyte-activating factor, LAF", the biologic activities of
{L-1 are numerous and several cell types such as fibroblasts, mesangial cells and keratinocytes
are capable of producing or responding to IL-1. Within the CNS the cells that produce IL-1
include neurons, microglial cells and astrocytes but it is also transported into the CNS from
the periphery following an inflammatory response. IL-1 effects on CNS function include the
induction of cerebral cortical activities such as sleep and wakefulness and such hypothalamic
activities as fever, appetite and pituitary hormone release. The mechanisms involved in these
effects are largely unknown. The effects of IL-1 are mediated through IL-1 receptors (IL-1R)
which are also expressed in the CNS (dentate gyrus, cortex, hypothalamus) (Deyerle, 1992)
by both neuronal and non-neuronal cells.

Experimental Design

| propose to investigate the expression of IL-1 (a, & and ra) and determine how this
expression relates to the expression and function of nAChRs in the nervous system. The
working hypothesis is that IL-1 alone, or complementary, to trophic factors such as NGF,
enhances the expression of nAChRs. The subsequent activation of nAChRs in turn regulates
the expression of this cytokine.

Two avenues of research will be explored:

1. | will use PC12 cells as a model to examine the interplay between IL-1 {all forms)
expression, NGF, and nAChR function. Friedman et al (1991) have demonstrated that IL-1
induces the expression of NGF mRNA. Preliminary results from my laboratory suggest that
NGF stimulates the expression of IL-1ra protein suggesting a possible "feedback loop” in the
expression of IL-1 by PC12 cells (IL-18 increase --> NGF increase -- > IL-1ra increase --> IL-
1B activity blocked). Further, mRNA for IL-1 and NGF is co-localized in some regions of the
brain (i.e. granule cells of the dentate gyrus, pyramidal ceils of the hippocampus, granule cells
of the cerebellum and the olfactory bulb) (Bandtlow, 1991}. The effects of NGF on IL-1 (a,
8, ra and IL-1R) expression by PC12 cells will be investigated further by measuring both RNA
and protein expression using antibodies for each of the IL-1 members.

The effects of IL-1 on nAChR expression in PC12 cells has not been determined previously.
IL-1@ and IL-1 will be incubated with PC12 cells, and the effects of these mediators on
nAChR subunit expression will be determined by Northern blot analysis using subunit specific
probes, immunocytochemistry (nAChR subunit specific antibodies have been generously
provided by Dr. Scott W. Rogers at this institution), and direct binding of radioiodinated
antibodies to PC12 cells (Rogers, 1992). One member of the nAChR family that can be
readily measured by ligand binding in PC12 cells binds '*l-a-bungarotoxin. Therefore the
effects of the cytokines on nAChR subunits and o-bungarotoxin binding will be determined.
Further, IL-1 effects will be tested for complementarity with NGF on nAChR expression and
will be tested with IL-1ra to determine whether the antagonist abrogates the effect of IL-1.

The effect of acute or chronic activation of nAChRs by nicotine administration on the
expression of IL-1 (all forms) by PC12 cells will also be investigated. | will assess changes
in IL-1 (a, 8, raanIL-1R) and nAChR subunit expression (mRNA and protein) following chronic
and acute incubation of cells with nicotine.

2. The relevance of the tissue culture model to the animal will be tested. The distribution and
