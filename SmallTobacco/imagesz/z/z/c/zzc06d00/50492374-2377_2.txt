expression of IL-1 and iL-1ra in inbred mouse strains that exhibit high or low binding of either
3H-nicotine or '51-bungarotoxin (Collins, 1989, Marks, 1992) will be examined. Subsequent
to establishing base-line expression, in collaboration with Dr. Collins, | will chronically
administer nicotine to these animals to enhance the expression of high affinity *H-nicotine
binding sites, and to determine if the expression of IL-1 is altered as anticipated from cell
culture studies. The brains from animals that have been nicotine treated or controls have
been prepared and are available from Dr. Collins. IL-1 expression in these studies will be
determined by in situ hybridization using *°S-labeled riboprobes.

Conversely, IL-1 as a mediator of inflammation acts upon the CNS to induce increases in core
body temperature. Does elevated IL-1 affect the expression of nAChR subunits? Mice will
be administered IL-1 (intravenous or intraventricular) and alterations in nAChr determined by
in situ hybridization.

Collectively these studies will provide the first insight into the co-regulation of nAChRs and
a cytokine in the CNS. They will also provide the basis for further investigation of interactions
between the expression of CNS receptor systems, cytokines, and trophic factors.
