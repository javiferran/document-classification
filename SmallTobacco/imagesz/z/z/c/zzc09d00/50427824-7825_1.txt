virtually no loss by evaporation, no contamination by sur-
rounding dried sweat, no risk of burn to the subject, stan-
dardized electrical current area and pilocarpine concentra-
tion, and collection of relatively large sweat volumes (150
uL) in about 45 min.

The chromatographic system is a slight modification of
the one reported by Miller and Cappon for the determina-
tion of bromide in serum ultrafiltrates (7). The conditions we
selected adequately resolve the chloride peak from the peaks
immediately before and after it; in particular, the resolution
is improved by slowing the flow rate to 0.7 mL/min before
the chloride peak appears. The chloride peak is thus rela-
tively broad (Figure 1) and easily quantifiable. As Figure 1
also illustrates, the peak for chloride for sweat from a CF
patient is significantly larger than that from a control
subject.

The retention time for the chloride peak varied according
to the time of day the sample was analyzed. For samples
injected soon after the chromatograph was turned on, the
chloride retention time was about 7.3 min, while for those
injected 8 h later it was about 9.5 min. The other peaks had
similar prolongation of their retention times, so the relative
relationship of the peaks remained unchanged and there
was no difficulty in identifying the chloride peak. We are

Fig. 1. Chromatograms of sweat from a conirol (A) and from an
individual with CF (B)

Note the larger chloride peak in the CF individual

currently investigating the identity of the other peaks. We
choose not to leave the system continuously turned on, and
thus to increase the lifetime of the light source and of the
pump; as stated, this does not present insurmountable
analytical difficulties.

The sweat collection takes about 45 min and each chro-
matographic analysis takes no more than 12 min. If several
standards are included and the sample is run in duplicate,
the whole procedure takes about 90 min.

We conclude that “Macroduct” sweat collection coupled
with anion-exchange liquid chromatography for determin-
ing chloride in sweat is a reliable and efficient method for
confirming the diagnosis of CF.
