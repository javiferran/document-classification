to extrapolate the maximum, amount of nicotine present and the time. at which
it occurs: during, the smoking. run. All of the extrapolated results are
higher than the first collected sample. The extrapolated time for the
maximum concentrations ranges between 9.96 and 9.98 minutes. into the run,
corresponding to within one puff of the completion of smoking of alll the
cigarettes. Use of this procedure should yield a better estimate of maximum
nicotine by compensating for the plating out effect that iis known to occur
over time. Both nicotine values indicate that there is an increase of
approximately 8% in -CRJ-1, essentially no change in -CRO, and a 13%

reduction in -CRP.
For this sample set, reduction in visibility is accompanied by

increased ms/ss. TPM ratios. CORESTA data reveals that relative to the base
sheet model, the mainstream to sidestream TPM ratios for -CRO and -CRP

increase 61% and 86%, respectively.
