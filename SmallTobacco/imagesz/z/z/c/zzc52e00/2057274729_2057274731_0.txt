Subject: .Examination of Centrifuged Boehmite

Two samples of Boehmite, precipitated sol-gel, batch 001, were
received. One of the samples, labelled product, had been centrifuged, dried
and ground. The other sample was the feed sol-gel prior to centrifugation.

Both samples were mounted on carbon stubbs with carbon paint and

examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and backscatter electron
microscopy.

The purpose of this examination was to determine if any metal flakes
from the stainless steel centrifuge vessel were present within the product.
Backscatter SEM was used to locate these since it affords the ability to
selectively view differences in atomic number elements within a sample.
This is demonstrated by Figure 1 where a small piece of a stainless steel
razor blade was examined to serve as a control.

The feed sol-gel sample examined showed no metal (Figures 2-3). Energy
dispersive x-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) was then used on the product te
determine if there was a high concentration of metals present. Al, the
constituent of the sol-gel, was the only element detected (Figure 4).

The product was then subjected to backscatter SEM. No metal flakes
were noted within the sample examined (Figures 5-8).
