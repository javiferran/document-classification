- High level of frustration was expressed by Supervisors and hourly workers about the problems with
the increasing pad levels

- According to A-Shift operator some efforts have been made to improve RL run in blending. One
effort has been to adjust the position of the steam valve (believe to have uneven distribution of
steam on product in the steam cylinder).

‘+ ~=—s The only process change that the A-Shift Supervisor was aware of was the change from a 26.
minute line to a' 24 minute line last month.. This means that' they run the blend for a line in 24:
minutes versus 26 minutes..
