SUBJECT: Newport 10's Update

Following is an update of the 10's test in Detroit and the South
Bronx. In addition, the progress on further testing is detailed.

Background

A Newport 10's pack program was placed in stores in the South
Bronx the week of 6/02 and in Detroit the week of 5/25. The 10's
packs were placed in temporary displavs with p.o.s. support
including 2 wide, 4 wide cards, shelf talkers and small posters.

The perceived benefit to consumers was an out-of-pocket cost
advantage, thereby serving as a trial device for the Brand.

The South Bronx test area is a lower income area with a primarily
Spanish population. RJR audits indicate a 9% S.O.M. for Newport
box, second in share to Marlboro box. New York tax laws require
a tax stamp on the 10's which was affixed by the jobber at a cost
of $1.25 per thousand units. In this area 4 of the original 10
test stores were replaced due to excessive pilferage. This had
resulted in our displays being removed from the counter by store
owners.

. In Detroit, total Newport Green has a share of 4.60% (12 months
through 9/82). Logistically, this test was easier as taxes are
paid by the jobber off invoices. Fourteen stores were tracked in
the Detroit panel. After July 23rd however, data on only 5
stores was tracked due to stores dropping from the panel and 1
store closing. Â°
