Sales are stable. Heavy promotional discounts, package
changes and the No Bull Theme seems to have slowed this
franchises downward trend.

Sales continue to decline despite promotional support and
new packaging. The brand continues to struggle due to
growth of Newport and heavy promotions on Kool.

The brand is popular with young adult smokers, and sales
gains continue for light packings. Camel Menthol sales are
slow and flat, with limited new trial. Kamel Red continues
to experience slow sales and distribution losses.
