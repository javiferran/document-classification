LORILLARD SALES TRENDS

Maverick Specials -

Newport -

Newport 1280's -

Sales Continue to increase throughout the area. Most
significant sales gains have been made in cigarette outlets,
tax differential outlets and convenience stores. The
continuous buy down is the driving force behind volume
gains, The recent change to $6.50 per carton buy down
gives us a greater advantage over the competition thus
further increasing sales. However, with the increased buy
down value, many accounts are now being identified as
having RJR's EDLP Program. This may have a negative
impact on limiting our promotional support at retail for
Maverick brands. The two Box 100â€™s packings are
experiencing sales growth as distribution and awareness are
now at higher levels. Maverick is now firmly established
as the #2 or #3 overall brand in the inner city of Atlanta.
Menthol Box 100 is now a power brand in urban Atlanta.

All box packings continue to enjoy substantial overall
growth. The Lights Box packings continue to experience
distribution and awareness increases. Much of the Light
Box growth is coming from outside the Newport family.
Newport is maintaining its market position despite
competitive programs and the recent impact of the price
increase,

Distribution objectives are being met. Brand is beginning
to show slow, but steady gains overall since the change in
target class of trade to General Market stores. Sales
continue to be spotty. Couponed product tends to sell
through, however non-couponed product sales are usually
slow. Actual sales continue to favor Full Flavor 1206's over
Light 120's.
