COMPETITIVE SALES TRENDS (Cont'd)

Basic - Sales were stable in most accounts during October and
November. The December Buy Down accelerated sales. A
very loyal customer base maintains the sales volume when
promotional support is not available.

BROWN & WILLIAMSON

Kool - Brand continues to show decline, despite heavy
promotional support and new packaging.

Kool Natural - Distribution is very strong in all segments of the market.
They continue to promote heavily and push advertising
behind this brand. Sales are very slow. Movement is down
sharply following initial BIGIF.

GPC - Sales have been declining, which appears to be due to a
reduction in promotional support. GPC pack redesign and
Mediums Line Extension appear to have had minimal
impact on overall sales.

Carlton - Sales are soft, with very little new trial.

Misty - Misty has a loyal customer base, which has allowed sales to
remain steady to only slightly down, despite reduced
promotional support.

LIGGETT & MYERS

AH Products - Sales and distribution continue to decline in all markets.
