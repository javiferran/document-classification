Subject: SGA-YSP-IMD working group

Attached are revised notes from our last meeting in Dec. and subsequent discussions with several of
you.

Pls review carefully and provide feedback, we need to finalize this general outline and then move
forward with implementation.

Clearly some of these iterns are long term efforts, but we need to provide tools to the RD's, and more
importantly, a broad plan they can utilize in their own states in '99 and beyond.

Scott/Pam/Henry/Dan/Ted -- we need to pull a real plan together for each of the legislative orgs listed
in the plan, and perhaps others. BUT, we must coordinate with YSP and follow their lead re:
thoughts on how best they can support/complement our efforts. And there is the issue of over
committing YSP and being streched too thin that we must always consider.

1 am happy to work with each of you along with KD, in pulling those plans together, with an emphasis
on substantive policy results, not PR. As meetings are fast approaching, how does the end on
January sound for a deadline?

Josh/Tom/Chris -- what's the status of the state research, both state and fed dollars? Do we need
to meet again re: the studies of states and their various approaches to the issue of youth smoking?

Chris -- you and I need to set a date and meet with the attys for a little legis. drafting, and as we
discussed, we need to do that ASAP.

All -- What am | forgetting?
