CAMEL EQUITY STUDY (#350-60)
ANALYSIS MEETING (6/20/94)

1. Attitude Segmentation:

The objective is to identify the attitudes that embody the
spirit of young adult smokers.

* The segmentation is based on the responses to a
battery of 55 attributes on attitudes toward life.

* Initial results indicate two distinct groups that
reflect a CAMEL attitude.

* The first group is highly sociable and is
characterized by the following attitudes:

Want to live in/near a big city.

Prefer a party to a quiet night at home.
Too wild to settle down.

Having fun is extremely important.
Prefer an exciting adventurous life.
Important to keep up with new styles.
Fitting in with friends is important.

Camel occasional usage is highest among this group.

* The other group is slightly more detached, as the
following attributes suggest:

Work is not important.

I don’t always think things through first.

Not important to keep up with new styles.

Not worth paying extras for well-known brands.
Fitting in with friends is not important.
People should be free to look, act and dress
the way they want.

This segment contains a high proportion of white
males in their late 20’s and early thirties. It has
the highest proportion of Camel UB smokers, and is
the second highest on occasional usage.

* The largest segment include the conventional, work-
oriented, settled-down smokers who prefer a quiet,
secure life.

* The final group is the smallest, and has the most &
pessimistic attitude. They tend to live for today, m
and believe that its a waste of time to plan for
the future--life is just a matter of luck. ba
