gei-filtered platelets indicates that these cells are in a resting
state. Anti--profilin gold label, in the form of aggregates con-
taining an average of four to eight and occasionally as many
as 40 gold particles (Table 1), was observable in several com-
partments of the cell. Some appeared to reside within cyto-
plasm separate from any definable organelles. Aggregates of
gold were also associated with plasma membrane and intra-
cellular membranes. There was no gold labeling of cells
when they were incubated with IgG-coated gold and preim-
mune rabbit IgG (Fig. 3).

The distribution of profilin label in the sections was quanti-
tated by morphomeiry (Table 1). This analysis focussed on
the apportionment of label between plasma membrane. intra-
cellutar membranes, and cytoplasm. 16.7 + 1.6% of the total
anti-profilin gold particles and 13.8 + 1.3% (mean + SEM)
of gold aggregates were associated with the plasma mem-
brane in the resting platelet. whereas 16.8 + 1.4 and 22.6 +
4.1% of total gold and gold aggregates. respectively. were as-
sociated with membrane-bound intracellular granules or or-
ganelles. The concentration of gold aggregates per microme-
ter of plasma membrane was 1.7 + 0.) (2 = 17 (platelets).

Fig. 2 b-d demonstrates the intracellular distribution of pro-
filin in electron micrographs of thin sections of platelets that
have been activated with | U/ml of thrombin for 15. 30, and
300 s. respectively. Treatment of platelets with this concen-
tration of thrombin resulted in an immediate (15 s) extension
of filopodia from the cell margins (Fig. 2 6). These exten-
sions were more elaborate 30 s posuhrombin treatment, at
atime when intracellular granules have become compressed
in the cell center (Fig. 2 ¢). After 5 min of incubation with
thrombin, however, the cells returned to a more uniform
morphology characterized by smaf!. blunt surface protru-
sions (Fig. 2 D). The profilin-membrane association increased
markedly after 15 s incubation of the cells with thrombin.
Total gold label at the plasma membrane increased to 24.5
+ 1.0% and gold in aggregates to 266 + 0.9% at that time.
