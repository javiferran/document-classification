Abstract. Profilin is a conserved, widely distributed
actin monomer binding protein found in eukaryotic
cells. Mammalian profilin reversibly sequesters actin
monomers in a high affinity profilactin complex. In
vitro, the complex is dissociated in response to treat-
ment with the polyphosphoinositides, phosphatidylino-
sitol monophosphate, and phosphatidylinosito) 4,5-
bisphosphate. Here, we demonstrate the ultrastructural

binding protein of eukaryotic cells (Carlsson ¢1 al.,
1976: Magdolen et al., 1988; Reichstein and Korn,
1979). Mammalian profilin occurs as a single isotype (Ampe
et al., 1988; Kwiatkowski and Bruns, 1988) and interacts
with actin monomers to sequester them from recruitment
into actin filaments. In vitro, the affinity of mammalian spleen
profilin for skeletal muscle actin monomer is relatively tow.
Ks = 1-50 pM (Markey et al., 1982; Nishida, 19853,
is higher for nonmuscle actin, K, = 10-400 nM larees
and Lindberg, 1938), whereas profilin and actin can be puri-
fied as a high affinity, K, = 1-10 nM, profilactin complex
cells (Blikstad et al., 1980; Carlsson et al., 1976;
Hanis and Weeds, 1978; Malm, 1984; Markey et al... 1978).
‘The factor(s) responsible for the high affinity profilactin
complex have not been identified (Larsson and Lindberg.
1988). The transien) appearance of the high affinity compiles
before and/or during platelet activation (Lind ct al., 1987,
Markey et al., 1981) suggests that some mechanism exists in-
side cells for its rapid formation and dissociation. Lassing
and Lindberg (1985) have demonsteated that the high affinity
complex can be dissociated by treatment with the polyphos-
Phoinositides. phosphatidylinositol monophosphate (PIP).'
and phosphatidylinosito! 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP) in vitro.
More recently, human platelet profilin has been shown to
bind PIP and PIP, reconstituted into vesicles in vitro (Lass-
ing and Lindberg, 1988; Goldschmidt-Clermont, P.. J. Bal-
dassare, and T. Pollard. manuscript submitted for pubtica-
tion). These observations raise the question as to whether or

immunolocalization of profilin in human leukocytes
and platelets. In both cell types, a significant fraction
of profilin is found associated with regions of cell
membrane devoid of actin filaments and other discern-
ible structures. After platelet activation, the membrane
association of profilin reversibly increases. This study
represents the first direct evidence for an interaction
between profilin and phospholipids in vivo.

notan interaction between phosphoinositides and profilin oc-
curs in vivo and whether this interaction regulates the transi-
tion between the high and tow affinity states of the profilactin
complex.

PIP and PIP; consist of an acidic, phosphorylated inositol
side group connected to a glycero! backbone to which two
long hydrophobic acy! chains are attached. They are. there-
fore, likely to reside in cellular membrane compartments,
and indeed are widely thought to be localized to the inner
leaflet of the plasma membrane (Garrett and Redman, 1975;
Maucoet al., 1987). The presence of rnultip!e distinct meta-
bolic pools of PIP and PIP; in erythrocytes and platelets
(Billah and Lapetina, 1982; King et al., 1987). suggests.
moreover, that some PIP and PIP; are sequestered in the
plasma (and perhaps othe intracellular) membrane(s). pos-
sibly due to binding to cytoplasmic proteins (Anderson and
Marchesi, 1985: Sheetz et al., £982).

In support of an intracellular interaction between profilin
and membrane-bound PIP and PIP;, here we provide direct
morphologic evidence for a close association of a large por-
tion of cellular profilin with membranes in both intact human
platelets and 'Wakocytes. In addition. we demonstrate a re-
versible. transient association between profilin and plasma
membrane after the activation of platelets, consistent with
previous observations of the formation/dissociution of pro-
fitactin complexes during platelet activation.
