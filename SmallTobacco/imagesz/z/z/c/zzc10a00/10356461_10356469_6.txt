Figure 5. Electron micrograph showing the distribution of anti-profilin gold label on the cytoplasmic side of an unroofed polymorphonuclear
leukocyte. Cells. adherent to glass. were unroofed by adhering and removing polylysine-coated coverslips. This representative electron

micrograph shows that profilin is found on regions of membrane free of actin filaments and coated pits. and not on the remaining actin
filaments adjacent to the membrane ai the cell edges. Gold partucles are indicated by the white arrows. Bar. 0.1 pin.
