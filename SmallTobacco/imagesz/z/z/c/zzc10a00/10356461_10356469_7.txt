Platelet activation with thrombin is well-recognized to
cause a marked shape change reaction, accompanied by actin

polymerization and alterations in levels of the high affinity

profilactin complex. Although the precise time course of
events as assessed by different investigators have been some-
what variable (Lind et al., 1987; Markey et al.. 1981), all
agrec that early on (0-10 s) during platelet activation, there
are high levels of the profilactin complex as well as un-
polymerized actin, while later G0 s-5 min) profilin is found
free or in a low affinity complex with actin, and extensive
actin polymerization occurs. In our experiments, activation
of platelets with thrombin resulted in a rapid and reversible
movement of anti-profilin gold label to the plasma mem-
brane (Fig. 3). Maximal movement to the membrane oc-
curred temporally just before the onset of actin polymeriza-
tion (Lind et al., 1987). observations are consistent
with the hypothesis that the high affinity profilactin complex
in platelets must interact with phosphoinositides resident in
the plasme membrane to yield free profilin and actin for actin
assembly (Lassing and Lindberg, 1985, 1988). The subse-
quent decreased amount of gold label found at the membrane
after longer periods of thrombin treatment, may indicate the
transient nature of the profilin phosphoinositide interaction,
due either to hydrolysis of PIP, to inositol 1.4.5 tisphos-
phate and diacyigtycero] by phospholipase C, or other mech-
anisms. Indeed, as intracetlular Ca” release, mediated by
inositol 1,45 trisphosphate, is thought to increase the affinity
of phospholipase C for PIP; (Manne and Kung. 1987), this
event would provide a mechahism for dissociating profilin
from the membrane. Because of the coordinated, finely regu-
lated and spatially circumscribed nature of most cell move-
ments, similar morphologic evidence for a transient mem-
brane interaction with profilin will be difficult or impossible
to obtain in other cell types. Nonetheless, as a general mech-
anism, uncoupling of actin from profilin at the membranc,
in conjunction with generation of actin nuclei or the uncap-
ping of filament ends. would link receptor stimulation and
actin filament growth both temporally and spatially.

These observations atso lend further support to the con-
cept that profilin may serve an important physiologic role in
the regulation of polyphosphoinositide metabolism. We
found that 13.8% and 22.6% of anti-profilin gold label was
associated with plasma and internal membranes of resting
platelets, respectively. If the profilin concentration in plate-
lets is 30-40 pM (Goldschmidt-Clermont, P., 5. Baldassare.
and T. Pollard, manuscript submitted for publication) then
11 2M profilin is membrane associated. The binding of
profilin to PIP and PIP, in the membrane may occur
through a single profilin-PIP, bond or possibly through in-
teraction with several (up to eight) inositide head groups. as
recently proposed (Goldschmidt-Clermont, P., 3. Baldas-
sare, and T. Pollard, manuscript submitted for publication).
Clustering of acidic phospholipids has been noted in mixed
vesicte preparations in vitro (Eklund et al... 1988, Haverstick
and Glaser, 1987), and may well occur in vivo. Thus. profilin
could bind 11-88 ~M PIP and PIP; in platelets, where the
PIP and PIP: concentrations are estimated to be 100-200
nM (Rittenhouse and Sasson, 1985). Evidence for distinct
metabolic pools of phosphoinositides has been obtained in
both red blood cells (King et al., 1987) and platelets (Billah
and Lapetina, 1982). Short-term labeling experiments in
thrombin-stimulated platelets have also suggested that nearly

all the PIP, turnover occurs at the plasma membrane
(Mauco e1 al., 1987).
~ ‘These latter observations sre consistent with the possible
ion of polyphosphoinositides cellular components.
Glycophorin (Anderson and Marchesi, 1985) and gelsolin
(anmey and Stossel, 1989) are other PIP; binding proteins
that may participate in this process. Our current results pro-
vide further evidence for the importance of phospholipid-
protein interactions, and suggest that the profilin-phospho-
inositide interaction may have wide consequence in control
of phosphoinositide metabolism and cell signalling.
