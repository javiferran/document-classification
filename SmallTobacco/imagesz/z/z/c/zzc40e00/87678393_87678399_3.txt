In a study of the anti-fertility properties of some essential oils, trans-
anethole (a major component of star anise) elicited no teratogenic effects
but showed 100% anti-implantation activity in Charles Foster rats. Test
animals were orally administered 100 mg/kg trans-anethole on day 1 through
day 10 of gestation. On day 11 rats were laparotomized and the number of
implantation sites were recorded. Animals were allowed to continue to full
term and were evaluated for teratogenic effects at parturition and for one
month post-parturition (Dhar et al., 1990).

A maternal no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 35 mg/kg/day was
determined for rats following oral administration of anethole from 7 days
pre-mating through day 4 post-parturition. The NOAEL for the offspring was
175 mg/kg. Anethole was reported to be not uniquely hazardous to
reproduction in the female rat or the development of the offspring in this
study (Unpubl.)

IMMUNOTOXICITY

Anethole exhibited no immunosuppressive potential in mice after repeated
daily dosing at levels substantially higher than those likely to be achieved
under actual conditions of use (875 mg/kg/day for 11 consecutive days)
(Unpubl.).
