steals spotlight
from ttle duel,

By The Associaied Press

FONTANA, Calif. — Scott Pruett stole the
spotlight from the CART championship | bat
tle, giving Toyota its first Champ Car pole
yesterday | in qualifying: fort the season-end-
ing Marlboro 500 at ornia Speedway,

Pruett, who will switch to NASCAR Win-
ston Cup racing in 2000, turned his fast lap
of 235.398 mph early in the session on the
windswept two-mile oval. He then waited
nervously for the drivers who were ‘fastest
in practice to take a shot at him. :

“The toughest thing for me was 46 wait
for Max,” Pruett said, referring to Max Pa-
pis, who was the last driver in line and the
favorite to win the pole.

But Papis, who ran out of fuel on the final
lap of the U.S, 500 in July after dominating -
the only other 500-mile event in the 20-race
CART FedEx Series, came up short.again
with a lap of 234.544.

Pruett, 39, who took over Papis’ ride with
Arciero-Wells Racing after Papis left for
Team Rahal this season, overshadowed the
duel between series leader Dario Franchitti
and rookie Juan Montoya, who go into to-
.day’s race separated by only nine points in
the battle for the $1 million PPG Cup title.

Montoya, who said he was slowed consid- -

“erably by the wind, qualified third at 234,251,
with Franchitti eighth at 233,174.
“My car was perfect,” Montoya said. “It

was just too windy. If you asked me what I~

would change if] qualified again, I would say,
‘Nothing.’ I'm confident. We have a good car.”
Franchitti needs only to finish ahead of
Montoya to win his érst series champi-
onship. If Franchitti finishes in the top three,
the Colombian cannot overcome hislead,  -
