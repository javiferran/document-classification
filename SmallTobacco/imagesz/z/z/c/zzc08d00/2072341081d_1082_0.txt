Hi Sharon:

I had Elissa follow-up on obtaining info from the restaurants below.

Tavern on the Green is the only TAP participant, however, several of the others allow
smoking.

Since I don't know the restaurateurs personally, I was wondering if you had a personal
relationship w/ any of them. If so, can Tracy use your name as an "in" for discussion
