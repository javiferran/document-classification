Carolyn,

I think we should help, too. (TAC? Company? or ER?)
If you or Vivian want more info, see this morning's

I will talk to Dottie about collecting money for our employees affected by the hurricane. I
personally think we should do something to help our co-workers. I let you know as soon
as I talk with Dottie.
