factory in Yabucoa (in southeast Puerto Rico, about an hour's
drive from San Juan).

--We don't have all the facts yet, just limited preliminary
information regarding the hurricane's impact on these facilities.
According to preliminary reports, doesn't seem to be any major
structural damage to the plant -- some wind damage on roof,
perhaps some flooding. A crew is on the way today to evaluate
the situation. (The plant has been closed since Monday of this
week, due to weather conditions.)

We have heard there appears to be minimal damage to the
office in San Juan -- a window blown out, perhaps some water.
If asked:

--How many employees? About 300 at the plant, 150 in the office.
--Any employees injured? Have not received any reports of any
serious injury among employees. Have heard that some employees
have lost homes, roofs, or belongings.

--When did plant open? What produces? Opened in 1970,
produces cigarettes for consumption in Puerto Rico as well

as export cigarettes. (We don't detail our sourcing further.)
--When will plant re-open? Depends on when/what basic
services are available, might re-start production operations on

a limited schedule this week, depending on conditions.
(Carolyn: I'm sending this to you just because I know TAC has
sometimes been involved in help for flood victims ... don't know
whether there's any interest in reaching out to employees

in Puerto Rico affected by hurricane.)
