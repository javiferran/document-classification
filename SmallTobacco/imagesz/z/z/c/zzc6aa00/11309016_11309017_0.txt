COMMENTS ON CANCER INCIDENCE

 

Epidemiological studies of death rates have claimed that a strong
association exists between cigarette smoking and increased risk of death in cancer
of (a) lung and bronchus, (b) buccal cavity and pharynx, and (c) prostate.

If one is interested in analyzing the factors that may be involved
in the causation of cancer, the incidence of the various types of that disease is
more pertinent to analysis than are death rates.

No attempt to cover all epidemiological data on cancer morbidity
has been made but the data from reports by two State Departments of Health(1Â»2)
are sufficiently challenging to justify their presentation and to urge further
collection, study and analysis of similar data from other sources.

As examples of the claimed increased risk of cigarette smokers

(3) 1958 give the figures of 31 times for lung

over non-smokers, Hammond and Horn
cancer, 7 times for buccal cavity cancer, and 1.90 for genito-urinary cancer in
white males. Skin cancer is not included as such in their data. There is,
however, a "catchall" classification of cancer of "other specific sites," in which
skin cancer would be presumably included. In this group, the death rate among
cigarette smokers is recorded as being only 0.89 that of non-smokers.

It is fair to state, therefore, that there is no epidemiological
evidence of association of cigarette smoking with death from skin cancer.

It has repeatedly been claimed that the generally-admitted increase
in cigarette smoking during the past several decades is a significant, if not the
main, causative factor in the increased death rate from lung, buccal cavity and

prostatic cancer.

Let us see whether incidence rates of these diseases bear out this

sweeping and basic hypothesis. Data are given in Table 1.
