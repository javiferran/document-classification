Combined data from New York and Connecticut show that in males the
age-adjusted incidence rates of 1935-36 and of 1958-60 bear the following
relationships:

The incidence rate per 100,000 has increased 29.8 for lung
cancer in accordance with the above mentioned hypothesis. The rate
per 100,000 for buccal cavity cancer has decreased 5.47 in direct
contradiction to the hypothesis. The rate for prostatic cancer has
remained practically constant (0.52 increase per 100,000), showing
no association.

The incidence rate per 100,000 for skin cancer, where no
association is claimed, had increased 24.55 -- essentially the same
amount as in lung cancer.

In females, the same comparisons show an increase of 1.1 per
100,000 for lung cancer, 0.4 for cancer of the buccal cavity, and
19.5 for skin cancer.

When the sexes are combined, the figures show a 44.09 increase
for skin cancer, 30.99 for lung cancer, and a 5.07 decrease for

cancer of the buccal cavity.

Reconciliation of such data with those of supporters of the

"association" hypothesis seems to be essential before acceptance of that

hypothesis as indicative of any causal or basic significance is justified.
