Dear Mr. Suffredin;

Everyone is aware that Governor Thompson has proposed a cigarette
excise tax increase. On Friday, April 7, 1989, Senator James
"Pate" Philip, Minority Leader of the Illinois Senate, introduced
SB-1113 for the 18 cent cigarette excise tax increase and the bill
was referred to the Revenue Committee on Thursday, April 13, 1989.
If passed, this bill would have a major impact on many sectors of
the Illinois economy as well as our industry.

I invite you to evaluate this tax bill with Kurt L. Malmgren,
Senior Vice President of The Tobacco Institute at a very important
meeting being held on Monday, April 24, 1989 from 10:30 am to

12:30pm at the O'Hare Hilton, International Airport, Chicago, IL -
PH: 312-686-8000.

Please RSVP no later than Friday, April 21, 1989 by call 1~800-544-
7288.

Sincerely yours,

Bill Trisler
Regional Vice President
