RESULTS

Chonges in transmural central venous pressure

during air hyperventilation

Mean central venous pressure fell in each of 12
experiments during air hyperventilation (Table
1); the average change was 2.9 mm. Hg. Mean
esophageal pressure fell in each experiment. The
average change was 4.3 mm. Hg. In si] but one
experiment esophageal pressure fell more than
central venous pressure. The difference between
these two pressures, the transmural central venous
pressure, increased by a highly significant average
value of 1.4 mm, Hg during air hyperventilation
(p< 0.01). ‘This increase occurred in association
with reduction in end-expiratory CO, tension
which averaged 16.8 mm. Hg and increase in
ventilation which averaged 23.2 L. per minute.

In Experiment 5 (Table 1) mean central venous
pressure decreased more than esophageal pressure
during air hyperventilation. This resulted in a
fall in transmvral pressure. The fact that this
experiment differed from the others cannat be ex-
plained. Its appearance in the group of eight
subjects for which the CO, hyperventilation stud-
ies apply accounts for the probability value of
slightly less than 10 per cent. When the entire
group of 12 subjects is considered the probability
of air hyperventilation not resulting in increased
transmural pressure is less than one per cent.

Changes in transmural central venous pressure
during CO, hyperventilation

Mean central venous pressure decreased in-four
and increased in four of eight experiments during
CO, hyperventilation (Table 1). The average
change was an insignificant decrease of 0.1 mm.
Hg (p > 0.8). Mean esophageal pressure fell in
each of the eight experiments, the average change
being 46 mm. Hg. The transmural central ve-
hous pressure decreased in one and increased in
seven experiments; the average change was a
highly significant increase of 3.9 mm. Hg (p <
0.0E ).

Comparison of transmural central venous pressure
changes during air hyperventilation with those
which occurred during CO, hyperventilation

Transmural central venous pressure was higher
during CO, hyperventilation than during air hy-
perventilation in each of eight experiments (‘Table
1). The difference between these two pressures
was highly significant and averaged 2.5 mm. Hg
(p< 0.001). This difference occurred because
central venous pressure failed to fail appreciably
during CO, breathing. It could not be attributed
to changes in ventilation or esophageal pressure
ag these were the same during both air and CO,
overbreathing.
