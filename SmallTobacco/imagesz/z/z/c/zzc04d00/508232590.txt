Dear Hudnall: ud

ZK

 

The Monograph on the new cigarette was here on my desk
when I returned to New York, and I really have enjoyed reading
this. Needless to say, I did not absorb every nuance, but the
overall impact of the document is very positive.

First of all, I am impressed with the meticulous nature
of your studies and the exemplary way in which they are
presented. Obviously your peer review committee felt the same
way.

Next, the product of itself is impressive. I was
astonished when I saw it "in action" at our meeting with you,
and now the analysis of the concept and the construction is
equally impressive.

Finally, you have done a very good thing in producing
this document. It should help the new product gain public as
well as scientific acceptance. There would seem to be little
doubt that you are on the right track.

When I have absorbed a little more from the volune, I
will pass it around the office so that all can see this.

I am enclosing a summary of the neuroendocrine effects
of nicotine, prepared by Dr. Don Ford of our staff here at CTR.
Don is a neuroanatomist, who has a long-standing interest in
nicotine effects, and he has prepared an excellent summary
which might be of interest to Bob DiMarco or some of the
members of his staff.

Thanks for the welcome on our recent visit and thanks
for letting me see the book.

Sincerely,
Sin See ;
