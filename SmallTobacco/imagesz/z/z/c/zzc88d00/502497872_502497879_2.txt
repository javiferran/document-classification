per cent of subjects had undetectable levels,
despite nearly 50 per cent reporting no expo-
sure.

Thiocyanate and carbon monoxide CO
levels were unrelated to exposure, as was also
the concentration of nicotine in plasma. How-
ever, there was a linear increase in salivary
nicotine with exposure, and urinary nicotine
was significantly higher in those who reported
any degree of exposure than in those who
reported “none at all” (12.1 v 3.9 ng/ml, p<
.005).

Analysis by time of day of attendance at the
clinic showed that while cotinine measures
were relatively insensitive to this variable, sal-

ivary nicotine concentration was markedly
higher in afternoon (n= 64) than in morning
(n= 36) attenders (5.65 v 3.35 ng/ml, p< .01).
Indeed, only in afternoon attenders did sali-
vary nicotine level relate to self-reported expo-
sure.

These data, gathered in a stringently defined
group of non-smokers, demonstrate that bio-
chemical markers can provide a sensitive guide
to the extent of recent daily life exposure to
ETS. Of particular significance from an epi-
demiological standpoint is that non-invasive
samples of urine and saliva conveyed essen-
tially the same information about exposure as
did invasive and less easily gathered blood
