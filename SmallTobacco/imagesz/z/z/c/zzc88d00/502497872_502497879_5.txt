non-smokers under natural conditions was based on

self-reports. Urinary nicotine concentrations in a sample of 100 smokers from Russell & Feyerabend
(1975) and Feyerabend et al. (1982) '6 averaged 1289 ng/ml.

them to the average levels found in smokers
(1289 ng/ml). When this is done, the averages
for “exposed”, “non-exposed” and all non-
smokers are roughly 1/80, 1/250 and 1/125 of
the levels found in smokers.

These estimates depend on a number of
assumptions. The main one is that the relation
of urinary nicotine concentrations to nicotine
intake is linear. Another is that smokers and
non-smokers excrete as unchanged nicotine
the same proportion of a given dose. There is
some evidence that this is so (17). It is likely

that the influence of urine pH and urine flow
on nicotine concentration would be balanced
in large samples and there is no reason to
expect systematic differences between smokers
and non-smokers in these factors.

The five-fold discrepancy between CO and
nicotine intake in the short-term study suggests
that CO intake from normal daily exposure to
ETS would be proportionally higher, i.e.
roughly 1/15, 1/50 and 1/20 of the intake of
smokers for “exposed”’, “non-exposed” and all
non-smokers respectively.
