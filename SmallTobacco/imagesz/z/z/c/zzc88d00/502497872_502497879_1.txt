naire and provided samples of blood, expired
air, saliva and urine. True non-smokers were
defined as those who reported no smoking of
cigarettes, pipes or cigars and whose levels of
plasma cotinine were below 20 ng/ml. The
latter requirement resulted in the exclusion of
21 self-reported non-smokers whose levels of
biochemical markers were similar to those
found in self-reported smokers, and were
therefore incompatible with their claimed
non-smoking status. It should be noted that
exclusion of these subjects was conservative
with respect to establishing a relationship
between measures of smoke absorption and
self-reported ETS exposure, since the
“deceivers” typically reported high levels of
exposure to ETS.

Exposure to ETS was indexed by the re-

sponse to the questionnaire item: “Have you
been exposed to tobacco smoke from someone else
in the past three days?” The response catego-

ries were “Yes, a lot”, “Yes, some”, “Yes, a
little”, and “None at all”. Only 7 of 100 sub-
jects reported “yes, a lot” and almost one half
(46) reported no exposure at all in the past
three days. This was not unexpected in a group
composed mainly of elderly people, many of
whom were chronic invalids and led restricted
lives.

A number of markers were measured by
standard methods in samples of various body
fluids and in expired air. The data are pre-
sented in Table 1.

Overall mean levels of each marker were
low, but it can be seen that the concentrations
of some markers were nevertheless clearly
related to exposure, while others were not. The
concentration of cotinine, whether measured
in plasma, saliva, or urine varied systematically

 

with exposure. In those reporting the two
highest levels of exposure it was at least three
times greater than in those who reported no
exposure at all. By way of example, the distri-
bution of individual levels of urinary cotinine
is shown in Figure 1. It can be seen that only 12
