intravenous infusion of 1.0 mg nicotine base at |
a steady rate over one hour. The experiment
was repeated in two of the subjects with a dose
of 0.5 mg nicotine base. Average plateau levels
of plasma nicotine reached 6.6 ng/ml and 4.2
ng/ml respectively. These values are consider-
ably higher than we found in our short-term
exposure. They are also higher than those
reported even under extreme conditions of
exposure (14). The areas under the mean con-
centration-time curves (AUCs) after the two
infusion doses were compared with the mean
AUC of three subjects in another study (15)
who smoked one middle-tar cigarette. The 1.0
mg and 0.5 mg nicotine infusion AUCs were
about 50 per cent and 35 per cent respectively
of that produced by one cigarette.

The slow infusion of nicotine over one hour
was designed to simulate the intake from short-
term exposure to ETS. The average plasma
nicotine concentration after exposure in the
public house was 2.5 ng/ml (Table 2), which is
0.38 of the 6.6 ng/ml produced by the 1 mg
nicotine infusion. But the 1 mg infusion was
equivalent to only 0.50 of the cigarette dose,
suggesting that the nicotine intake from the
exposure in the pub was equivalent to only

0.38 X 0.50 = 0.19 of a cigarette. Similar
calculations with 0.5 mg nicotine infusion data
give an equivalent for the exposure in the pub
of 0.21 of a cigarette.

In summary, if it is assumed that the plasma
nicotine concentration of 2.5 ng/ml was
mainly determined by nicotine intake during
rather than prior to entering the pub (which is
not unreasonable in view of the short half-life
of nicotine in plasma), the estimated nicotine
intake during the 2 hour exposure was roughly
equivalent to 0.2 of a cigarette, while the CO
intake was equivalent to one cigarette.

Normal daily exposure

Estimates of intake during brief exposures of
1-2 hours provide little information about
exposure throughout a normal day. Owing to
its short half-life, plasma nicotine is unsuitable
as an index of nicotine intake over the past few
hours. This is apparent from the data in table 3.
Urinary nicotine concentration is probably a
better marker of intake over several hours.
Data on urinary nicotine concentrations in
non-smokers are available from previous and
the present studies (Table 3) and one way to
determine their dose equivalent is to relate
