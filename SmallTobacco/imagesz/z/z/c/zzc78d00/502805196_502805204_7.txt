Y._Teata on ZEMPO Cizgrettes

Teste have been made to show the effect that changing to new crop
tobaccos would have on nicotine in smoke of TEMPO cizarettes made using
the new blend and new filter. Original tests had indicated a nicotine
content in smoke of 0.97 m./cigt. Use of 1962 crop burley has increased
this to 1.05-1.12 mg./cigt., and use of the 1963 flue-cured crop increased
this to approximately 1.27 m./cigt. Denicotinization of 21.5% of the
burley would reduce nicotine in the smoke from 1.27 to 1.14 mg./cigt. At
the present time, tests are being made in which 43% of the burley was
denicotinized.

Four different blends have been made and tipped with various types

double cut 1/8 inch x 1/8 inch while the other product was cut cigarette

Vitis Adhesives

Tests have been made to (1) evaluate samples of CAMEL export over-
wrap, (2) determine the opening characteristics of cigarette cartons,
(3) solve adhesive problems which re: lted from increased speeds in
making and packing and boxing machines at Whitaker Park, (4) evaluate
USI Dynafilm as e replacement for cellophane, (5) improve the sealing
characteristics of WINSTON Christmas cartons, (6) evaluate various
adhesive materials, and (7) conduct routine control tests on adhesives.

Xs_Micotina Raduction in Tobacco Products

Routine denicotinization of K1QK burley strips has continued.
Average nicotine removal was 59.2% as compared with 60.1% for the pre-
vious month.

In a laboratory test, flue-cured strips were denicotinised using
a 40-minute cycle. Nicotine was reduced from 2.17 to 1.65% (24%
reduction). A limited sapkers' test showed that the control cigarette
tasted mich better than the treated tobacco cigarette.
