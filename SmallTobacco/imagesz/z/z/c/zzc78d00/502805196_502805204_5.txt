S-_. Gontro] of Nicgting Contant of Cisaratte Blends

Nicotine contents of burley and flue-cured crops of tobacco
have increased considerably. In order to avoid significant increases
in nicotine content of tobacco and smoke of our cigarettes, it will
be necessary to make bleng changes, filter changes, paper changes,
to denicotinize additional quantities of burley strips, or use a
combination of these factors. Tests are now in progress to determine
what changes mst be made.
