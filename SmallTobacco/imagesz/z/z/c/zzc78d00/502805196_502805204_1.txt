B.__ ANALYTICAL RESEARCH DIVISION

Improved analytical procedures are being sought for the following
vapor-phase constituents of cigarette smoke!

a. The relative amounts of the two nitrogen oxides (nitric oxide
and nitrogen dioxide).

b&b. Formaldehyde
c. Phenols

a. Water

6. Other gaseous components such as acetylene, ethylene, propylene,
ethane, and propane.

Development of an analytical procedure for amaonia in smoke has been
coupleted.

is__Geaphouse Studies

Studies are continuing on the growth of tobacco plants in nutrient
solution in the greenhouse. The development of these methods will be
useful for growling tobacco to produce Labelled tobacco constituents for
studies of their fates during smoking.

XiL._Biosynathesis

&-.. Tegronic Acids

The study of the production of these tobacco flavorants by a
fermentation process is being continued,

b-_. Hisokine Derivatives

Fifty grams of "Compound 350', a fermentation product of nicotine,
ie being prepared for teste to be made at Battelle Memorial Inatitute.

ILL. _Biolozical Zesting
A eciliastatic assay is in progress on the new TEWO

IÂ¥._Rri-Die for Control of Tobacco Reatlas

Laboratory tasts have shown that prolonged conditions of high humidity
do not inactivate Dri-Die, a possible control agent for tobacco beetles.

Lhis o8COS

Preparations are being made for a large-scale test of Dri-Die at the
Kernersville sheds next spring.
