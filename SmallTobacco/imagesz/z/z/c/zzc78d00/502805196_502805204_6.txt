Lil: Bvaluation of Special Filters and Materials

Ideas or samples submitted from outside the Company for evaluation
included (1) a nulti-component filtex, (2) a smoker's moutipiece,
(3) polyethylene fiber filters, and various types of charcoal. Results
of tests did not indicate that additional work with the submitted ideas
or samples was justified.

IN... Special Tests on Carbon Filters

A test was mide to determine if carbon would pick up flavor exhausted
from a tobacco dryer and result in a better tasting smoke when used in a
cigarette filter. No significant improvement in flavor vas accomplished.

A test was made to determine if treatment of carbon with potassiua
permanganate solution would improve removal of oxides of nitrogen froa
smoke. S8fficiency was oot iaproved.

Tests were made on bonded carbon filters to determine if draft
resistance influenced aldehyle removal. Date were not conclusive but
indicated that as draft increesed, aldehyde removal increased.

Tests were made to compare the efficiency of carbon filters with

that of Estron filters in reducing nicotine and total solids in cigarette
smoke. The results were ‘1+ following:
