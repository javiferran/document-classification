Subject: Results STEP 2.2

Dear Franz and Hans,

Please find attached the results of the intermediate step 2.2.
{See attached file: VALIDATION (RESULTS STEP 2_2).PDF)

You will see that the results are “ausgezeichnet”. We got a higher “Slope of best fit" than before.
The concentration factor is definitively a key point to get a relevant scale for a comparative effect
assessment.

Would you please fet me know what you want us to do for STEP 3 (reproducibility/repeatability).

Very best regards,

Adabe Portable
Occument

Michel.
