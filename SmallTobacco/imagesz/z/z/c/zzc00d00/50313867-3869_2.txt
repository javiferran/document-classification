(C) letters of support and collaboration

Enclosed is a letter from Dr. Lee Limbird who has agreed to continue our
collaboration begun with the studies described in reprint #2. Dr. Limbird will
provide partially-purified alpha,-adrenergic receptor from porcine brain for use in
the studies outlined in specific aim #1.

Letters of support/collaboration from Drs. Haber, Nadal-Ginard and Hans-Jlirgen
Hess will be fowarded directly to the Council.

Although not directly involved in the proposed studies, Dr. Haber (Chief of the
Cardiac Unit) has made available to me the intellectual expertise and specialized
equipment found in the Cardiac Unit.

Dr. Hans-Jiirgen Hess, Executive Director, Medicinal Chemistry, Pfizer Inc., has
collaborated with me in the development of the radioiodinated probes described in
reprints #1, 2 and 3 and will continue to serve as a consultant on various chemical
aspects of new probe development and the synthesis of affinity matrices.

Dr. Nadal-Ginard, Chief of Cardiology, Childrens Hospital, Harvard Medical
School, has extensive experience in the techniques of molecular genetics and various
aspects of gene regulation. To facilitate the studies described in specific aim #2,
I will spend two-three months in his laboratory once amino acid sequence data is
obtained. Dr. Nadal-Ginardâ€™s laboratory is only three miles from Massachusetts
General Hospital, which facilitates such an arrangement and allows for continued
interaction on a daily basis.
