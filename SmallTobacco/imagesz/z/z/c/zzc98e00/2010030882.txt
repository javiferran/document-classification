See New Cigaret Tax as Bootleggers' Dream

By RON HOLLONDER

If the state tax on a pack
of cigarets is raised six
cents, a move the Legisla-
ture is considering, the city
will be an even more attrac-
tive ground for bootleggers.

The boost would bring the
total tax in the city to 22
cents-a-pack, (plus sales tax
of another three cents) as
opposed to current state
cigaret taxes of 14 ‘cents
in New Jersey, 16 cents in
Connecticut, 13 cents in
Rhode Island and 18 cents in
Pennsylvania. But North
Carolina, the state from
which millions of cigarets
are bootleged into the city
each year, would still have
a tax of only two cents a
pack.

This 20-cent-a-pack differ-
ence is the incentive for boot-
leggers to make the journey
from North Carolina to New

York, their rhe ith false,
backs ipg the iletral carko-
dia

eee wee eee

or their cars with abbreviated
gas tanks crammed with
thousands of cartons of
brand-name cigarets.

The cigarets are then sold
to a middle-man who in turn
sells them, several cartons at
a time, at plants, factories
and offices.

This week, the Cigaret Tax
Enforcement unit of the
state's Special Investigations
Bureau stopped a small de-
livery van loaded with 2,316
cartons of cigaretes bearing
the North Carolina tax decal
but no New York tax stamp.

Alerted beforehand that
the truck bearing the con-
traband was heading for New
York, four agents in three
cars started following van as
soon as it entered New York.
The driver, growing suspic-
ions, ran three red lights to
determine whether he was
being followed and tried to
shake the agents:

Unable to "lose them, . he

suddenly parked the truck
truck and cigarets were con-
fiscated. The cigarets are
worth $10,000 if sold at the
legitimate market price of
about $4.25 a carton. If dis-
tributed illegally, they would
bring about $7000. They cost
about $2000 in North Caroli-
na.
Last year 120,000 carton
of contraband cigarets were
seized by the state agency,
almost all of them in the
city. There is no reliable of-
ficial estimate of how many
got through undetected.
Persons entering the state
may bring with them two
cartons for their own use.
Above that they must pay
the state’s tax, and the
packs would then be marked
with a stamp bearing the
state seal.
In 1968, iniporting more
than 100 cartons of untaxcd
, ejgarcts was made a. fclony
, punishable by up to. five

c

years imprisonment. Pay-
ment of the state cigaret tax
is also required on cigarets
bought through the mail,
even if the original pur-
chase price doets not in-
clude the tax. A federal law
requires anyone in one state
mailing cigarets to persons
in another state to notify
that state’s tax agency of
the name and address of the
receiver of the cigarets. The
tax agency will then send
him a bill.

The Cigaret Tax Enforce-
ment unit has 70 men stak-
ing out various entry points
into the city and inspecting
cigarets being sold for the
proper state stamp. Arrests
have been made at La Guar-
dia and Teterboro airports,
where contraband has been
flown in, and at but stations,
where smugglers were
caught on interstate buses.

Most of the cigarets come

from the towns of Weldon and.
Egigly,, N. ©. and other, vil-; smoking state agent, .?'
ar Sond atest se

lages along Interstate High-
way 95, which the agents call
“Tobacco Road.” Gas stations
along this route have signs
advertising cheap cigarets.
Often the stations are just a
front for the warehouses 1>
cated Sehind them,

The smuggling business in
untaxed cigarets is so prof't-
able that tobacco company
trucks bse Seen hijacked en
route to the city, cases of cig-
arets intended for South Am-
erica and therefore unstamp-
ed have been stolen from
piers and bootleggers have
even ?djacked competitors’
trucks.

The Cigaret Tax Enforce-
ment unit asks anyone having
information on suspiciously
low-priced or unstamped ecig-
arets to call CO 7-1617. And it
is girding for the increase in
bootlegging which the pos-
sible state tax increase will
bring.
