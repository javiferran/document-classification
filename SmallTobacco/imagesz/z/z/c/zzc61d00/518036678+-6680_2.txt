Potential Issues

We intend to bill Directs as if it were a B2G1F (no charge for the third pack at 25¢).

Are there any concerns from Directs about billing, tax reporting, suggested/automated
retails to their customers?

How can chains handle retail pricing, PLU’s, scan programming, etc.?

Media Support: Any issues with Marketing using OOH, print, etc., to advertise the
promotion to general public with the intent of trying to drive consumers to RJR retail
partner stores to find the promotion? Issue: May run Partners out of promotion
before some consumers see the OOH and print advertising.

e Any other issues?

We realize the challenges and potential difficulties can be significant any time changes
are made to promotions and packings. Please discuss this topic at your upcoming
meetings and provide feedback no later than October 13, 1997.

Thanks for your help.
