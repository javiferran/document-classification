RE: April Buy 2 Packs Get 1 at 25¢

As we discussed, please ask your KAM’s, AM’s and AE’s to contact some of their

wholesalers and chains (in confidence) relative to the logistics associated with a Buy 2
Packs Get 1 at 25¢.

Program Details

April 3.1 Million offers

CAMEL would tie into an event in history and provide a third pack at the price it was
when the event occurred (i.e., 85th birthday of CAMEL, repeal of prohibition, etc.,
etc.).

Offers would be sleeved (3 pack in carton sleeve) with special tear tape and pack
markings indicating the pack is a certain price (i.e., 25¢).

We would bill Directs same as a B2G1F; only charge for 7 live packs per carton.

In-store advertising would tout the event that CAMEL is celebrating and indicate the
third pack is at a specific price.

Retailers could keep the free profit on the third pack. Ideally we-would leverage this

amount by asking the retailer to put up the display, place POS or provide other service
for us.

Sales brochure to be provided to leverage promotion and RJR retail partnership
against PM exclusive accounts.

Possibility of DSD kit containing POS support materials to be sent to participating
accounts in advance.
