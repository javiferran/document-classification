We have isolated cDNAs encoding a murine cyclin A, designated cyclinA2, and have examined its in vivo expression at

the level of both mRNA and protein, with particular focus on the male germ line.
in a variety of adult tissues, including the testis. In the testis, however,

Cyclin A2 is expressed in embryos and
a striking cellular specificity of expression was

observed. At both the DNA and protein levels, the predominant sites of cyclin A2 expression were in the germ line stem
cells, the spermatogonia, and in highest levels in preleptotene spermatocytes, cells in which premeiotic DNA synthesis
oceurs. The concurrent localization of cyclin A2 MRNA and protein further suggested that cyclin A2 is regulated at the
level of transcription in these cells. The observed cellular specificity of cyclin A2 expression is consistent with its function
during mitosis in the stem cell stage of this lineage, while the restricted meiotic stage localization suggests function in

G1/S or 5 but not in the meiotic divisions per se.

INTRODUCTION

The mitotic and meiotic divisions of mammalian germ
cells are particularly amenable for study during spermato-
genesis. In the female germ line, many of these events take
place in the embryo and meiosis is interrupted until after
puberty. In contrast, in the male germ line, mitotic prolifer-
ation of spermatogonia, the initiation of the meiotic cell
cycle, the meiotic divisions, and the production of haploid
spermatozoa take place, continuously and unintermpted, in
the adult testis. Analysis of germ cell development in rhe
male is therefore an excellent system to study both mitotic
and meiotic cell cycles in vivo as well as the mechanisms
that control regulatory checkpoints that are distinct be-
tween the male and female germ line.

Identification of many of the gene products involved in
controlling mitotic and meiotic cell cycles of several model
organisms has greatly facilitated our understanding of cell
cycle regulation. Key among these is a serine/threonine pro-

tein kinase complex that consists of a regulatory subunit,
cyclin, and a catalytic subunit, homologs of the S. pombe
edc2 protein kinase p34*"*! (Cde2) (Forsburg and Nurse,
1991; Norbury and Nurse, 1992; Jacobs, 1992}. As the kinase
is reliant upon cyclin for activity, this family of con-
served proteins is collectively known as cyclin-dependent
kinases {cdk} (Pines, 1991}.

asses of vertebrate cyclins have

rand Morgan, 1994). The A-
type cyclins were originally thought to function at mitosis,
similar to the B-type cyclins (Norbury and Nurse, 1992;
Lewin, 1990). However, cyclin A is synthesized and de-
stroyed earlier in the cell cycle than cyclin B (Kobayashi et
al, 1991; Hunt et al., 1992} and cyclin A accumulates in the
nucleus immediately after its synthesis (Pines and Hunter,
1991; Girard et al., 1991, Pagano et al, 1992}. While cyclin
B appears to associate only with Cdc2, cyclin A associates
with both Cde2 and the Cuc?-related kinase, Cdk2 (Kobay-
