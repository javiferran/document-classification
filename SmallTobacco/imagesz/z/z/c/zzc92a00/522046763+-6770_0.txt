RE: Winn Dixie Merchandising â€˜

After extended negotiations we have reached an agreement with Winn Dixie on our 1996
contract. The following will summarize the Level | contract. Winn Dixie Corporate has sent
out general information to the W-D Divisions. I have faxed a copy of that correspondence to
your office. Please meet with your respective Division as soon as possible to discuss
implementation of the program.

Payment Rate: Self-Service Cartons - $135.00
Non-Self-Service Cartons = - $100.00

Carton Fixture

 

+ RJR will continue to supply carton fixtures, which will be vertically loaded. Attached are
example plan-o-grams which show company positions as agreed to by Winn Dixie. Specific
plan-o-grams should be developed with each Division based on their Tespective share of
market figures.

* Price Breaker will be allocated a portion of the top shelves based on the size of the fixture.
That space will run vertically until Price Breaker share of market is satisfied (2' wide space
on fixtures that are 9! or larger, 1' wide space on fixtures 8' or smaller). The remaining top
shelves will be divided equally between RJR and PM to run vertically until share of market
is satisfied.

* There will be no advertising above the carton fixture or NSS package fixtures. RJR canopies
will be removed from the carton fixtures. All ad copy will be removed from the NSS PM
package fixtures.
