Winn Dixie has instructed each Division to meet with both RJR and PM as soon as possible to
formulate plans to implement these changes i in the stores. In the past we have had to handle the
entire reset of carton fixtures. Winn Dixie is aware that we will not reset all of the fixtures and
the Divisions will be seeking help from both RJR and PM in completing these changes, ie.,

RJR handles 50% of stores, PM handles 50%. ....

If there are any questions, contact me or Account Executive D.J. Gesmundo.

Sincerely,
