Dear Ms. Gustafson:

Tam writing to follow up on my letters of December 7, 1994 and January 6,
1995. I hope that you still are interested in exploring the possibility of a cooperative
effort to reduce underage smoking in Washington State through the application of a
combination of our RIGHT DECISIONS/RIGHT NOW and SUPPORT THE LAW
programs,

Further, during our December 5th meeting we discussed the JOE CAMEL
advertising for our CAMEL brand. You were not surprised when I indicated that,
at that time, we were not prepared to discontinue all use of our present campaign;
however I take this opportunity to reaffirm what I did tell you during that meeting.
Even though we are confident that CAMEL advertising does not cause anyone to
begin smoking, if you believe that there are specific actions which we could take in
order to have a real impact on underage smoking, we are prepared to discuss your
suggestions in good faith.

I look forward to hearing from you on either or both of these subjects,
