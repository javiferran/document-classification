Listed below are the answers to the five questions that you proposed on our recent conference call
relative to the Doral equity test.

If an account is willing to fund the $.50 differential between Doral and its branded competitive
set, this is acceptable.

However, if this becomes widespread, it would flaw the test but | donâ€™t think the retailers will
reduce their margins by $.50.

The marquee/awning program can be sold and implemented in higher volume convenience gas
outlets and is not exclusive to cigarette outlets; however, CO's would be our first priority.

The $.50 per carton/$.05 per pack applies to all trade segments. The bottom line is in the entire
retail universe within the Kansas City Division should reflect Doral $.05 less a pack/$.50 less a
carton vs. branded competitive sets.

Relative to the pricing survey issues, adjustments will be made which will reflect on strategy if
Doral is $.50 less a carton/$.05 less a pack vs. branded competitive sets.

The additional part-time labor request (32 hours a week) is still under consideration. Will advise
when decision has been made.

Sincerely,

R. D, Garrison
