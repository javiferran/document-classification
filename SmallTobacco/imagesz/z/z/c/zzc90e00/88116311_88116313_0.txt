MEMORANDUM

TO: Executive Committee

FR: Samuel D. Chilcote, ie. So

Today the Senate Finance Committee conducted its third and
final day of hearings on revenue options. The hearing was
chaired for most of the time by Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT) ;
Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-TX) attended for just a short
period of time. Other Senators in attendance included Thomas
Daschle (D-SD), Donald Riegle (D-MI), Daniel Moynihan (D-NY),
Bill Bradley (D-NJ), and John Chafee (R-RI). The witness
list and selected testimony are attached.

 

 

 

Highlights include:

 

° Rudy Oswald, Director, Economic Research Department,
AFL-CIO, opposed any new or expanded sales, excise, or other
consumption taxes. "It is our strong belief that any new
revenues be raised on the basis of ability to pay," Oswald
said, adding, "regressive taxes are contrary to the goal of
tax justice and intent of Congress in enacting the 1986
reforms." Oswald encouraged the Committee "to focus its
attention on the individual and corporate income tax and the
estate and gift tax."

oO Paul Huard, Vice President, Taxation and Fiscal Policy,
National Association of Manufacturers, opposed any changes to
individual or corporate taxes or selectively imposed excise
taxes. "We oppose without exception any change that would
increase federal revenues derived from selectively-imposed
excise taxes," he said. Huard characterized excise taxes as
"undeniably regressive." He added, "If Congress is
determined to raise additional federal tax revenues, it
should only be done by imposing a consumption-type tax at a
uniform rate on the broadest possible base of taxable goods
and services."
