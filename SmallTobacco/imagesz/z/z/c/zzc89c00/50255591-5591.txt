Subject: Collagen Accumulation in Pulmonary Fibrosis

Reviewer: Leon 0. Jacobson, M.D.

She states that the central premise of this proposal is that lung collagen
accumulation depends on both collagen productive rate and extracellular deposition
of collagen. The experiment planned represent an attempt to identify the factors that
influence these pivotol steps in lung collagen acuumulation. Cultured lung
fibroblasts will be studied as a model of collagen accumulation. The plan wil .
be directed toward characterizing the kinetics of rat lung fibroblast procollagen
production, proteolytic processing of procollagen and deposition of

newly synthesized collagen into extracellular matrix. She plans as well to

study the regulation of collagen production and matrixformation and doing so will
examine the role of cyclic nucleotides and polyamines::as well as the influence of
exogenous substances produced by bronchoalvelor macrophages.

Under specific aims she wishes to answer the question - What is the effects
of cell density on the kinetics of fibroblast collagen production and matrix
formation regulated and finally how is lung collagen accumulation regulated
in vivo.

I think her methods and proceudres are well written. The budget is not

out of reasonable range but she do√©s ask for $10,000 in the first year for
permanent equipment.

I rather like this application.
