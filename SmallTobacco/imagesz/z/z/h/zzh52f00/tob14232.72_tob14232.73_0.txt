Bear Chairman Luken:

I am responding to your letter to me of April 27, 1989,
in which you request still more information from the R. J.
Reynolds Tobacco Company ("the Company") concerning the topic of
smoking scenes in movies or television programs. The Company's
responses to the questions enumerated in your latter are as fol-

lows:

l.

None. As stated in my letter to you of

February 28, 1989, the Company's policy since at
least 1982 is to make no payments for placement of
cigarettes or cigarette advertising in films.

From time to time, the Company, will provide free
product and/or promotional materials (not
including billboards) for a film preduction. When

-this occurs, however, it is in responge to a pro-

Gucer's request for cigarettes for use in a script
already containing a smoking scene.

Where television is the medium, our policy is sim-
ple and direct. We do not provide payments for .
placement, nor do we provide free product or other
promotional materials for use in television pro-
grams.
