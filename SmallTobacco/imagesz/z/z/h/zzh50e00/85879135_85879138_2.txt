- ~|Dr. Auerbach said. They form new,

ilayers or rows. ; ;
In nonsmokers, the pathologists)
usually found only three to five)
layers of basal cells, a very slight
amount of thickening. In smokers,
some had seven layers; some up
to 18 or -20. -
The thickening was found in
many more places along the tubes
of smokers than nonsmokers. The]
tubes were first cut into sections,
with up to 200. sections being’ made
{rom one person's tubes.
| Thickening was found in 18 per
cent of the sections from light to
moderate smokers, and 40 per cent
of: those from heavy smokers. It
was-also found in 42.7 per'cent of
sections of the tubes of. 14 persons

 

Only the air tubes were studied,
since lung cancer %egins ‘in them.
Fourteen were light to moderate

j|smokers,- the light smoker being
defined as up to a pack a day,
the moderate up to two packs.
Five were heavy smokers, lwo
packs plus. Another. 14 who had
cancers were all moderate to
heavy smokers.

‘| Dr. Auerbach, a nonsmoker, said,
it might -be learned within three
to five years whether smoking pro-
‘duced the thickening and set the
stage for cancer. _ -

The possibility of air pollution in

{the ,thickening should be consid-
ered, and age and sex of patients
should also be included, he added.
He said the findings in this first
series of 41 might turn out dif-
ferently in another series. .

The research, dene mostly on the
physicians’ own time, was sup-
ported -by the American Cancer
Society. .

Dr. Stout, professor emeritus of
surgical pathology at Columbia's
College of Physicians and Sur-
geons, and Dr.. Statsinger also do
not smoke. Drs. Petrick, Muehsam
and Forman are heavy smokers,
said Dr. Auerbach, while Dr. Gere
either. smokes or has. ~

Dr. Auerbach said that as the
research progressed, .the smoker-
members of the team had “‘lost
their skepticism about the find-
ings, but not their smoking habit.”

of he Tobacco Industry Research
Committee, said “coordinated
