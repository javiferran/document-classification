SUBJECT: Review of Research Suggestions from James Crapo

The following is a review of the research suggestions made by Dr.
James Crapo. This review has been developed in collaboration
with A. Mosberg and C. Coggins:

I. Evaluation of Cardiovascular Effects
1. Vascular Reactivity of the Coronary
Circulation

Determine acute coronary vasculature spasm in
models such as dogs, primates and possibly
man produced by reference cigarette smoke,
new cigarette smoke and nicotine.

2. Vascular Reactivity of the Cerebral
Circulation

Changes in cerebral circulation can be
determined by near infrared spectroscopy
using animal models such as the cat and
baboon and possibly man. The effect of
reference cigarette smoke, new cigarette
smoke and nicotine can be determined.

Critique

9 Dr. Crapo suggest factors such as
pyrolysis products, CO and nicotine
can have an effect on _ these
variables. The studies as outlined
do not adequately separate out
which factors (if any) may produce
observed effects (if any).
