The relationship between these
endpoints and human health are only
speculative. Data generated from
such studies would be of little use
at this time.

Preliminary data using cigarette
smoke may be useful to evaluate the
methodology and results from such
studies.

B. Chronic Human Studies

1. Epidemiologic Analysis of Cardiac Events and
Mortality in Patients with Coronary Heart
Disease Documented by Angioplasty

Product is currently not available
in the PRT, NC area. Such as study
could not be done until the
cigarette is available and
established in the area.

No method has been validated to
insure that the individuals in the
new cigarette group would be
smoking this cigarette and to
quantitative their use of the new
cigarette against other cigarettes.

2. Restenosis Rates after Angioplasty
Patients with Advanced Coronary Heart Disease

 

Encourage investigators to submit a
preliminary proposal.

Although this model for
atherosclerosis is interesting, a
number of problems exist including
the lack of appropriate data on
risk factors.

Although smoking has been alleged
to be a risk factor in this model,
other factors have been claimed to
be important. This include serum
cholesterol, diabetics and
hypertension. Separating out these
various factors will be a difficult
task, if possible.

Lack of availability of the new
cigarette and the lack of a
quantitative endpoint to determine
