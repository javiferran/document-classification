oe what type of cigarette is being

- smoked and how many of each type of
cigarette is being smoked is a
- major problem.

@ Not only must smoking be controlled
but factors such as diet also need
to be controlled. This will be
extremely difficult if not
impossible.

II. Evaluation of Pulmonary Effects

A. Animal Studies to Assess Induction of
Inflammatory Mediators in the Lung, Increased
Proteolytic Enzyme Load and Effects on Lung
Cells

1) Studies in dogs utilizing broncho-
alveolar lavage to determine:

a. Cell counts

b. Total protein and albumen
c. Elastase concentration

d. Elastase inhibitor capacity

e@. a-l-proteinase inhibitor
concentration.

@e There is merit to the proposed
studies if carefully developed
experimental protocols can be
provided. These should
include dosing and experimen-
tal methodology.

@ The studies could be an
adjunct to those in progress
to measure the effect of
PREMIER smoke on in vitro
a-1-proteinase activity.

 

2. Baboons

Studies in baboons to determine if smoke
increases more macrophages than neutrophils
in bronchoalveolar lavage samples.

training baboons to smoke
