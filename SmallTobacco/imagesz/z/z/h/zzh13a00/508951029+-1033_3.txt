cigarettes complicates their use as
animal models. It is suggested
that the investigators initiate
their studies with dogs as the
animal model.

Immunocytochemical Localization of Elastase
in the Alveolar Interstitium after Exposure
to Cigarette Smoke

@® Although these studies show
pronise, they should not be
initiated until further data on
elastase are developed. This will
allow protocols to be designed
based on data.

Morphometric Study of Airway Cell Responses
to Exposure to Reference Cigarettes and the
New Cigarette

a. Larynx
b. Terminal bronchiole
Cc. Proximal alveolar region

e These studies are similar to the
interest of investigators at RJRT.
High priority should be given to
collaboration between Duke and RJRT
on these studies.

Differences in Sites of Deposition of Inhaled
Particles and Gases

e These studies are similar to
studies being planned at RJRT and
would be a duplication of effort.

Human Studies of Acute Pulmonary Effects

@ There is interest in these studies
and Duke would be an excellent
site.

® It is suggested that a detailed
protocol including discussions of
the statistic design of the study,
including number of subjects, be
solicited.
