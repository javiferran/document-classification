John T. McCall, Esq.
Nashville Trust Building
Nashville 3, Tennessee

Dear Mr. McCall: .
Thank you for your letter of February 7, 1964.

«quite a few of our friends have suggested or offered to
disclose lines of research which might clarify the large gaps
in existing knowledge of the relation of tobacco to health.

We want you to know we appreciate the constructive approach
you and your client have adopted. However, we have thought it
best not ourselves to engage in the type of research your letter.
contemplates. Instead, since 1954 we have supported the Tobacoo
Industry Research Committee, 150 East 42nd Street, New York 17,
New York, which has made grants totalling several million dollars
to independent scientists engaged in a coordinated program of
research into questions of tobacco use and health.

Again, many thanks for taking the trouble to write us on. fe
