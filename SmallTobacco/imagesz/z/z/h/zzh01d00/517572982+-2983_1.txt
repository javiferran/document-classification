The possibility exists that the published sub-category results are correct, adjusted values
and that you inadvertently transcribed the crude results, rather than adjusted results, for
the dichotomous comparison.

In addition, I calculated the crude results for childhood exposure of females and then for
both males and females for adulthood household exposure. For childhood exposure of
females I generated results close to, but not exactly the same as, the results you published.
These differences would be consistent with differences expected in comparing crude and
adjusted results. For adulthood exposure, though, I exactly matched your dichotomous
OR’s and Cl’s, and I generated the exact same OR’s for the sub-category results. The
Cl’s for these sub-category OR’s were notably different, though, from the published
results,

Given all of the above results, I am unsure what I should believe about these and other
data in your paper. I would appreciate your review and response to this letter.

Specifically, I would like to know answers to the following questions:
e Are the OR’s in Table 2 adjusted or crude?
e Are the case/control counts in Table 2 correct?
e Are the spousal results in Table 4 valid?
