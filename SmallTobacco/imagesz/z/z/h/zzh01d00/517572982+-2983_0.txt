Dear Dr, Kabat:

I recently reviewed your paper, “Relation between exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke and lung cancer in lifetime nonsmokers” (Kabat GC, Stellman SD, Wynder EL.
Am. J. Epidemiol. 142(2):141-8, 1995), and noted a logical inconsistency that likely
indicates a minor error.

Specifically, in Table 2 (page 144), you list the odds ratios for males for exposure in
childhood as 0.90 for “yes” (i.e., any exposure), 1.12 for “1 smoker in the household,”
and 1.13 for “2+ smokers in the household.” These two later categories merely partition
the “yes” category, therefore the OR for “yes” should be some weighted average of the
OR’s for the sub-categories and should fall between 1.12 and 1.13. This is,
unfortunately, not true in the published table, thus one or more of the OR must, I believe,
be incorrect.

I calculated crude OR’s and CI’s from your published case and control counts for each
exposure category and was surprised to find that the crude results for “yes/no” identically
replicated your published results. This was surprising because you indicated on page 142
that “[u}nconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of exposure with
adjustment for covariates, including age, education, and type of hospital.” Does Table 2
contain adjusted or crude results? Your paper does not clearly state if the results in Table
2 are, or are not, adjusted. My calculated crude results for “1 smoker in the household”
was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.42-2,06) and for “2+ smokers in the household” was 0.87 (95% CI:
0.31-2.45), These calculated crude sub-category results are logically consistent with the
published, dichotomous “yes/no” results.
