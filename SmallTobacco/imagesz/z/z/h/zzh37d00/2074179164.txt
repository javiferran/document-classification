Subject: RE: 6' and 8' OPM Conversion

As areminder, my recommendation is not to ship OPMs fo retail accounts with a missing
panel in the OPM. Our accounts and FSF will be confused and we would have just created
total chaos at field level.

Additionally, by placing these items on hold we are confronted with potential rejected orders or
confusion as we are just beginning the new allocation process.

The plan we should be looking at is establishing a clear Game Plan & communications to
Madden and HUB agents collectively.

Harbor has about 100 message panels in spare paris and plans to ship them to Roselle on
Monday (Bulk). Secondly, Bob met with Molly, an prepares a PO for 3,000 + (depending on
open orders from Stacey and projected number at TPI ) Message panels for 6â€™ & 8' OPMs.

Hub recaps to Madden the total number of OPMs they have at each TPI depot that needs to
be retrofitted.

A labor force is hired and is sent to Roselle to open aif 6' & 8' opms and remove the clocks
and make one good OPM from 2 OPMs (marking each completed OPM with a retrofitted
sticker). Additional panels would be shipped from Roselle to TP! depots to have agents retrofit
them PRIOR to the day they are to be installed. {Documentation outline to follow)

Once the production of the Panels are completed from Harbor they are shipped to Roselle and
the remaining OPMs are made whole using the hired labor force again.

| know this is not the complete process flow, but does present a solution with out upsetting our
current process.
