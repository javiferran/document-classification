GENERAL ASSISTANCE TO OTHER PROJECTS -- Priority #4

I have been interacting with several individuals on an on-going basis to discuss
projects and to contribute when possible. Three recent examples are summarized
below:

Ernie Farrier in the area of flammable metals which may be useful in
accelerating the lighting characteristics of carbon fuel sources.

Dan Straka in regard to setting up a glass softening point apparatus for
quality control checks of incoming fiberglas materials.

Chandra Banerjee with respect to substrate parameters and technology for
generating a monolithic ceramic substrate.

CO-FREE FUEL SOURCE -- Priority #5

The possibility of making a CO-free fuel source by using Fe and Mg metal is
being investigated. Such a CO-free fuel source may be possible by eliminating
carbon altogether from the fuel source and using flammable metals in its place.
Of course, the processing and compounding of the metals will take a lot of
development. I did some initial research on this concept early in the year, but
this effort is presently idle due to the demands of the other activities.

Maybe we can discuss these programs during one of my next visits.
