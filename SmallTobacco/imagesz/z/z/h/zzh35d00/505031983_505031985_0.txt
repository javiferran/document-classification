Dear Mike,

Considering the time I am presently spending on the project and the infrequency
at which we discuss my activities, I thought it was time to write a short note
summarizing my efforts. I am concerned about priorities too, so important areas
aren’t neglected or that effort isn’t squandered on back-burner activities.

Summary of Activities

SUBSTRATE PROCESSING IMPROVEMENTS -- Priority #1

Improvements are sought in the present substrate process of loading -14 + 20 mesh
alumina spheres into the aluminum capsule. Bead strength and attrition resistance
should be improved and the flow of the beads into the capsules could be
improved. Current efforts with Dick Haberkern and John Stewart are focused on
increasing the strength of the substrate by doping the alumina prior to sintering.
Oxide additives such as Na» and MgO alter the pore structure during the sintering
process. The present concept is to maintain pore size at a minimum acceptable
with concomitant development of maximum pore volume. Since pores are stress
concentrators, large pores usually result in low strength. Some preliminary data
look promising in this respect, but continuing effort is required. Inorganic
powdered flow promoters, such as the tricalcium phosphate commonly used in
pharmaceutical products, are being screened to determine effectiveness.

EIBERGLAS INSULATOR REPLACEMENT MATERIAL -- Priority #2
Calcium sulfate whiskers from US Gypsum (Franklin Fiber) are the most
