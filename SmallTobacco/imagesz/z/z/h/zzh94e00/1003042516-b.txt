Puts Forth Public
Information Effort

In an unprecedented public
information effort, Americar
Caneer Soclety units through
out the state have achieved
special presentations on the snb-
ject of cigarettes and lung can:
cer on television stations.

The. programs have incorpor
ated the film “The Time to
Step is Now,’’ filling out. the
remainder of the time. with: lo-
eal live diseussions centered on
the action that the public must
take in this urgent. problem.

Speciak flyers which will promote

these show that extend full
coverage to every unit in the
state have been carried by the
125,000 Crusade volunteers. on
their door-to-door educational
Crusade.

The flyers feature a picture
of the. Society’s poster “Con-
gress has Acted... the Next
Step is Yours,” tying in the
theme of the film, “The. Time
to Stop Is Now,” which illus
trates effectively that. quitting
cigarettes even after years
smoking alow the body to re-
fair itself untit odds are nearly
as good as for the man whe
never smoked.

“The television programs
vresented during April.’ says
Mrs. Ed  Nnowles, publicity
chairman of the Union County
unt, “Bea yest ef the Amcfl-
can Cancer Society’s inten-
sive year-round educational ef-
fort to save lives. At present
rates,” Mrs, Knowles continues,
“in Dlinois alone, about. 5,800
or one sixth .of the 35,000 per-
sons who get cancer this year
will die needlessly. In Union
County the number of cancer
deaths will approximate 30: At
the present time some 90 per-
sons are being treated for can-
cer. op
