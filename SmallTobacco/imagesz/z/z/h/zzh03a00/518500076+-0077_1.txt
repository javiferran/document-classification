Each DM / KAM should be prepared to present their thoughts to the group ..... keeping
the presentation to 10 to 15 minutes. Just keep in mind, it’s not very often that we
resign all contracts and we must approach this project as an opportunity to truly correct
the problems that we have .... give this important project the time that it deserves!

I look forward to a very productive meeting!

Sincerely,
Wark Young
