Managers,

When looking ahead to the new Merchandising Contracts that will be resigned in all retail
accounts, we have an opportunity to “correct” the big on-going problem that we have
with out-of-stocks when the promoted product sells out (in a large percentage of our
stores).

 

Each Division Manager (along with your RM if he reports to you), and each Key Account
Manager (along with the input from your AM’s) should be prepared to explain to the group
your recommended Plan on how to utilize our new contract signing to solve the region’s
product availability problem as it relates to promoted product, retailers waiting for the
SR’s to place orders and the out-of-stocks that occur.

Can we use this contract resigning as “Leverage” to solve this problem?
Food for Thought:

® Is it time to change the region policy to ..... all promoted product
must be placed on temporary displays and only non-promoted

product will be placed in our permanent displays?

Q) Can we as region truly implement 9 weeks of discount promotion

and then turn it off for 4 weeks ..... with non-promoted “Full”
displays?

QC) When we resign all accounts to our new contract .... can we require
that a certain number of required brands “MUST” be instock at all
times .... or deletion of payment will be made?

1 How do we keep our priority brands in stock .... at all times?
