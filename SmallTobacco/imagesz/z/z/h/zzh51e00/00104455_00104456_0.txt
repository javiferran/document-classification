SUBJECT: PMO Aerosolization

Formulations have been prepared with the object of
obtaining a PMO aerosol which would enable human inhalation
of about 30 mg of PMO over a period of a few minutes to a
few hours.

Test formulations were dispensed using a Devilbis Model
# 40 hand-buib nebulizer operated either by squeezing or by
low pressure laboratory air after removing the bulb. The
amount of liquid dispensed, found by weight loss after a
given number of squeezes, was as follows:

mg/squeeze
Water 2.7
1:1 propylene glycol-water (w/w) 2.0
PMO saturated 4:1 propylene glycol-water (w/w) 0.93
PMO saturated propylene glycol 0.4

The variability in delivery is undoubtedly due either
to evaporation, in the case of water, or weight gain of water
by hydroscopic propylene glycol. The true delivery is
probably about 1 mg/squeeze as was obtained for the 4:1
propylene glycol-water mixture which should be nearly in
equilibrium with air at 35% humidity.

The room temperature solubility (@ 24Â°C) of PMO was found
to be 123 mg/g in propylene glycol and 65 mg/g in 4:1 propylene
glycol-water (w/w). (For practical purposes PMO is insoluble
in water or glycerine.)

Using 1 mg of solution/squeeze as the delivery, 240
squeezes would be required to deliver 30 mg of PMO from PMO
saturated propylene glycol and 460 squeezes for PMO saturated
4:1 propylene glycol-water.

The nebulizer filled with PMO saturated 4:1 propylene
glycol-water was operated using the laboratory air supply. A
rotometer in the air line read 15 scfh at 5 psi. The weight
