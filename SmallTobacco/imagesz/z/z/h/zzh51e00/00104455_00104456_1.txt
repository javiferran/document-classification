Dr. H. J. Minnemeyer -2- August 1,1974

loss was 0.5445 g of liquid in 5 min. Thus, the solution

was dispensed at a rate of 109 mg/min or 7.08 mg of PMO/min

and would require 4.25 min to dispense 30 mg of PMO. Since

the air flow (8.2 liters/min) required to operate the nebulizer
is about twice the amount an adult breathes (4 liters/min),
this means that if half the amount nebulized were breathed

then the 30 mg dose would be acquired in 9.5 min.

Ideas for other dispensing systems were considered
briefly but were discarded. PMO appeared miscible in all
proportions with FC-1l and suggested the possibility of
dispensing from an aerosol pressure can. Also, oil in water
emulsions containing 100 mg PMO/ml and 20 mg/ml of a blend
of Span 40-Tween 40 emulsifiers were prepared. These modes
of dispensing were not further considered due to their

toxicological conplications.
