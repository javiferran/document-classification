Marlboro Lights Box

In addition to the two highly-developed Marlboro Lights markets
(Minneapolis and Phoenix) that we suggested as test areas for
Marlboro Lights Box, we would also recommend conducting the test
in a below average Marlboro Lights market. We have found that
a number of the weaker Marlboro Lights markets are also strong
box areas. As such, a box packing in these markets may compli-
ment the soft pack and improve the overall performance of the
Lights! packings.

We would suggest New Orleans as a test market for this purpose.
The pertinent information on this area is attached.
