RE: Modification of May 4, 1994 Document Disposal Suspension Notice

Requiring Retention of Electronic Mail and Other Electronic Récords in
Their Original Electronic Media

On May 4, 1994, the attached document disposal suspension notice

(“suspension notice”) was issued as a result of a court order in pending litigation.

The suspension notice required, among other things, that electronic mail and other _.

electronic media be retained in their original electronic form for the categories of
records described in the suspension notice. |
_._ The court order requiring the retention of electronic media has been modified
by limiting the obligation to. retain electronic records subject to the suspension
notice to those written or generated on or before March 29, 1994. Effective on receipt
of this memorandum, the procedure specified in the suspension notice for retaining
electronic mai! and other electronic records in their original electronic form may be
discontinued prospectively for those electronic records capable of being printed.
From receipt of this memorandum onward, electronic mail and other electronic
records, if any, should now be retained, by printing and retaining a paper copy
only, in accordance with the usual retention practice for electronic records subject
to each Records Management Manual’s Appendix entitled Topics Subject to
Disposal Suspension. However, electronic records subject to disposal suspension
that are incapable of being printed must continue to be maintained in electronic
form.

Except as modified in this memorandum, prior document suspension notices
and the Appendix entitled Topics Subject to Disposal Suspension in each Records

Management Manual remain in effect without change.
