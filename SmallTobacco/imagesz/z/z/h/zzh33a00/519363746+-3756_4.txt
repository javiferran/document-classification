Between 1972 and 1976 the number of smekers fmoking over 30 per day

increased by @pproxhnately half Â« million, (Capehl 1978),

Measures which influence the number of cigarettes smoked include
. els Cobvon mo
adverUsing, health/fand above all taxation. These topics inay hot be a

  

specific part of the Committee's terms of reference,but I think the report
should emphasise that unless rising consumption is stopped and reversed by

buch measures, the death rates of smokers are likely to remain high,
