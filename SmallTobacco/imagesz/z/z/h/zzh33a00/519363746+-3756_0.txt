Addendum to the Second Re port of the Independent Scientific Committee

While aprecing folly with much of the substance in the Second

Report J find inyself in disagreement on severe) important details,

(1) Urgency

The Commitiee has spent 5 years evaluating tobacco substitutes
and additives. it could initially afford to postpone consideration of tar
yields because these were falling steadily up till 1973, This is no Jonger
the case, as the figures in paragraph 3 and figure ] demonstrate; so it is

â€œnow a matter of urgency to see that this fall begins again at a rate which

will rapidly bring Cigarette yields to low levels, .

During the carly stages in its work the Committee could do Jittle
about Carbon Monoxide yields because few figures for thes. were then
available. Figures for all the major brands have now been produced by
the Laboratory of the Government Chemist so it is imperative to establish

sales-weighted averages and ensure that these begin to improve without delay,
/

(Sce paragraph 4),

There is very good evidence that well over 50, 000 people in Britain
dic annually from smoking tobacco (Godber 1970, Wald 1978), and that some
25, 000 of these are under 65 years of age (Royal College of Physicians 1977}.

This fact alone argues that improvements in cigarette toxicity must proceed

-at the greatest possible speed, . .

The majority report does not scem to reflect the sense of urgency

which the above considerations give me.
