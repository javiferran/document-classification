Carbon Monoxide levels in Ciparette

 

 

Jhere is much evidence that carbon monoxide is a factor in
producing the retarded foctal growth which occurs in pregnant women who

smoke (Prrani 1978), (british Medical Journal 1976).

There js also evidence which shows carbon rnonoxide is important
(along with nicotine) in the increased incidence of sudden death from
coronary heart disease in cigarette smokers. â€˜It also causes patients with

angina pectoris to develop anginal pain sooner after exercise (Aronow 1976).

Carbon monoxide yields are only weakly related to tar yields, 60
reductions of tar cannot be relied on to bring carbon monoxide levels down,
Thus a separate series of maximum carbon monoxide yields will need to .

be established using a programme similar to the one for tar,

As many of the current brands are well within these limits, a much

faster rogramme of improvement might be possible.
