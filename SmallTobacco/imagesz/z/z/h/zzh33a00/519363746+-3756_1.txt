‘Is more evidence needed before recoinmendations | ?

the Committee propases (in pours. 27) to ask the industry lo
provide "full relevant dala to assist in reviewing and evaluating the
constituents of smoke so that the Cornmittce is better able to advise the
becrctaries of State about the desirability or otherwise of setting levels
for sarmne of these constituents", In iny opinion there is already sufficient
evidence to justify recommending maximum lirnits for Tar and Carbon Monoxi¢

yields, 1 shall describe this in the next two sections,

Tar levels in Cigarette Smoke

There is clear evidence incriminating chemicals in cigarette tar
asa factor in causing lung cancer. The U.S, department of Health, Education
and Welfare report (1971) reviews the evidence and concludes:- "These
(5) pipers add further support to the dose-response relationship between lung
cancer end total cigarette smoke-condensate exposure", Since then Hammond '<
Prospective study (1976) in U.S.A, has shown that "low tar" smokers (under
17.6 mg. /cigarette) have a lower mortality than high-tar smokers (over
25.8 me), after allowing for consumption etc,

In the first 8 years of systematic recording (1965-1973) average sales~
weighted tar yields in U.K. fell very substantially, frorn 31.4 mg/cig. to ,
18.7 mg/cig, a fall of 1.6 meg/year (Figure 1). This fall of 40% over 8 years
must contribute to much improved Prospects for lung cancer incidence, and
the manufacturers deserve appreciation for their great efforts. They also
deserve our commiseration for the fact that despite enormous expense and’
effort the development of substitutes have given them so ° Little help in making

further reductions of the same order,
