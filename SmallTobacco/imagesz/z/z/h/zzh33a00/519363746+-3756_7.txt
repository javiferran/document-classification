The everapes shown in figure 2 fox consumption of Cigarettes per
day per adult smoker are influenced by several factors. During the period
1968 - 75 many peaple stopped smoking (FRC 1976 Table 50), Ifa majority
of those who stopped were Nght smokers the remainder still smoking would she
an increased average consumption. This was true in women and accounts for
nome of the rise in average figures, but it was not true for men. (TRC 1976
teble 49). The average consuinption of men ex-smokers irnmediately prior
to quilting was 22.9 cigarettes /day between 1968 and 1975, The average
consumption for all male smokers during that period was 20. 8/day.
(TRC 1976 table 17). Thus the rise shown in men in Fig 2 is likely to be an

underestimate of average rise in consumption in continuing smokers.
