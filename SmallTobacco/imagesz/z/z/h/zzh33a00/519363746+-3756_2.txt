Poblication of

 

Carbon inonoxide yiclds of all the vain cigarette brands have
recently become available from the Laboratory of the Government Chemist.

In any opinion these Ievels should be published repulazly in the appropriate

medicel Journals in order lo facilitate further examination of the full effects

of carbon monoxide by medical scientists. (Presumably the DLWS.5. will
eventually follow the advice of the World Health Organisation Q975) and the
examiple of countries like Sweden and U.S.A. ¥* and publish carbon

monoxide levels to the gencral public).

IT also think that sales-weighted average carbon mononide yields

 

should be calculated and published annually so that any progress towards

Jow carbon monoxide levels can be monitored.
