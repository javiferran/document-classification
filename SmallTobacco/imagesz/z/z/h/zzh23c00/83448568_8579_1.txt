COMPANY TRENDS
PM continues to ship below peak, or even average, weekly volume totals.

Shipments are somewhat lighter than those seen prior to McLane's purchasing cutbacks two weeks ago. (See Table
6).

PM shipments have produced lowered shares of market for both full price products (40.9% this past week versus
year-to-date 42.8%) and discount products (5.7% this past week versus year-to-date 7.0%) respectively.

The lower PM shipment levels may reflect reduced post pipeline and/or introductory Marlboro Ultra and Basic 100
Box shipments.

RJR shipments, for the most part, have been fairly consistent over the year, with the larger portion of their volume
and share of market Josses coming from the full price segment. See charts on the next page.

B&W is performing poorly in both full price and discount price segments Gnore than 1B unit losses in each
segment). In total, share of market is off by .99 share point, (which is equal to PM's share point gain}.

Lerillard is the only one of the major manufacturers with share gains, albeit (modest} volume losses in both fall
price and discount price categories.

Liggett, while still losing volume (-8.0%) and share of market (-.06 point) versus year ago, has dramatically
reduced ts rate of decline.

At this point in time, in 1997 Liggett was behind year ago (1996) volume and share by -28.0% and -.4 share point,
respectively.
