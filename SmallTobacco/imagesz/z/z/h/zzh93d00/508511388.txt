Dear Tom:

I enclose a copy of a memo from Janet Wheeler, whom you know
has been in charge of the Sontek Filter Project.

I believe the memo is self-explanatory, and I am inclined to
agree with Janet. I am writing you to inform you that we plan
to do no further work on this project. I will, however, be
interested in any comments you may have to make.

Cordially,

Roy E\jMorse
