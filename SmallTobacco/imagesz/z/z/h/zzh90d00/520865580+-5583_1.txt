obligation to ascertain this information, especially since the
interrogatories are limited in time and scope and Donzi's own
records indicate that sales were limited to approximately 30
states and a few foreign countries. Indeed, there were only 30
sales of the 28 ZX in the year ending June 1997, and only
slightly more in 1998 and 1999. Annual unit and dollar sales by
state and country for this model -- and presumably others --
should be easily ascertainable from Donzi's records.

Donzi's responses to Interrogatories Nos. 5(e) and 6(e) are
similarly deficient. The "Customer Inquiry Monthly Reports"
produced by Donzi do not provide a complete response since
reports for various months are missing and others are illegible.
For instance, Donzi has failed to produce reports for January,
March and September-December of 1999; March, April and July-
September of 1998; May-September and December of 1997 and July-
September of 1996. In addition, the reports for June and
February of 1998, January-April and October/November of 1997,
and October, November 4-29 and December 2-31 of 1996 are
unreadable. Moreover, the reports do not indicate the number of
sales generated from such inquiries, nor do they provide the
response rate by advertisement and/or promotion in a way that is
discernable. Donzi has also failed to provide the response rate
for the various television, film and video promotions referred
to in its response. : :

At the very least, Donzi should produce the missing reports
and provide wus with readable copies of the illegible ones
already produced. Donzi should also supplement its responses to
provide the omitted information cited above. ' Moreover, to the
“extent that there are additional documents relating to these
reports ~~ or any other documents relating to customer inquiries
ox response rates in general -- they should be produced.

In response to Interrogatory No. 10, Donzi produced a list
of dealers as of August/September 1999 and a list of dealers
from 1993 to present. What is relevant, but missing, however,
is a list of Donzi's dealers in the October-December 1998 period
during which the Camel Mighty Tasty Lifestyles promotion ran.
Indeed, the lists provided appear to include dealers that no
longer carry Donzi's boats. Donzi should therefore supplement
