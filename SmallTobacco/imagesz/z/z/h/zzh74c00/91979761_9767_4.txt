IRI data shows that the floor display program started the week of 7/30 in Raleigh/
Greensboro and the week of 8/6 in Charlotte at which time the share went up.

Gains were made by Style in both markets during August but there was no change in the
coupon coverage which implies that the floor displays and not the perforated coupons
were responsible for this growth.

HARRIS TEETE

Style's share in Harris Teeter (Charlotte) during July and August was significantly lower
than it had been in previous months. -

Distribution and coupon coverage also declined in this chain which suggests that the
perforated coupon product was not available in these stores as of the end of August.

Note that IRI does not break-out coupons by type. Therefore, we cannot determine the
extent to which the perforated couponed product is currently available in these
supermarkets.
