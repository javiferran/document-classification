WINN DIXIE

The Winn Dixie panels in Charlotte and Raleigh/Greensboro were up significantly in both
markets during August.

Over 90% of this growth was due to carton sales and we can presume that the cartons had
the perforated coupons.

CONCLUSIONS
Supermarket shares of Style were up in August due to:
â€˜ the floor display with Food Lion
. the perforated coupon with Winn Dixie

We have seen no effects yet from Harris Teeter on the perforated coupon.
