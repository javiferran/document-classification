FROM: P. McFadden

RE: STYLE $5.00 PERFORATED CARTON COUPON - AUG/SEPT 1995

The following report on Style's $5.00 coupon test in North Carolina is based on data from
MIS (customer shipments) and IRI (retail supermarket sales) .

BACKGROUND

On July 10, we began a limited test of a Style $5.00 perforated carton coupon with the
following North Carolina direct accounts:

Food Lion - Dunn

Food Lion - Salisbury

Food Lion - Disputanta
Winn Dixie - Charlotte
Harris Teeter - Greensboro
Ingles - Black Mountain

Only four Style products will carry the $5.00 perforated coupons --i.e., 100 Soft Packs
NM & M and Slims 100 Box NM & M--since the two remaining Style packings, 100 Box
NM & M, have only minimal shares in these outlets.
