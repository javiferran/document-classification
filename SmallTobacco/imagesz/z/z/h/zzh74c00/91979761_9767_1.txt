While this promotion will ensure that nearly all Style cartons will have coupons at Point-
of-Sale, please be reminded that prior to this test, Food Lion was couponing Style at its

own warehouses (100% coupon coverage). In all other outlets our reps were couponing
all Style inventory when calls were made.

Additionally, a floor display program with Food Lion resulted in extra product being
shipped during the week of July 10 to stock the displays.
