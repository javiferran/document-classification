BaP than do heavy cigarette smokers living in rural areas of America. Even
. Y
go, the amount is extremely low as compared with the amount required to produce

* skin cancer in susceptible strains of mice.

_ The experimental evidence suggests that the amount of BaP inhaled by

“a elgerette smoker living in a British’ city would not come even close to the

dosage required to Produce a significant risk of lung cancer, uowever, different
the effects of an agent upon

. species vary greatly in susceptibility; and A, the skin of mice cannot be

directly extrapolated to possiblé effects upon the bronchial epithelial tissues
of man. For this reason, we decided to study death rates from lung cancer “and
other diseases among men with extremely heavy occupational exposure to BaP by

way of inhalation.

Sawicki collected air seuples in the vicinity of men working in piten

roofing operations and found 14,000 micrograms of BaP per 1,000 cubie meters of
air. Even higher amounts were found in air samples collected close to where a

roofer was attending a kettle of hot pitch. Thus it would appear that roefers

working with hot pitch are exposed te enormously greater amounts of BaP than

' Sare heavy cigarette smokers living in urban areas. -

For this reason, we decided to study death rates by cause of death

“ among men engaged in the roofing trade. At the same time we carried out a

chemical investigation.

~ The subjects were members of the United Slate, Tile and Composition

Roofers, Damp and Waterproof Workers’ Association which has locals in all parts

of the United States. Locals confined to slate and tile work were excluded.

The composition roofers are mainly engaged in applying hot pitch or hot asphalt
