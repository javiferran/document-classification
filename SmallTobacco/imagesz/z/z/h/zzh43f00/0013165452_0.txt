Both cigarette smoke and ‘polluted urban air contain very small amounts

:_~ of benzo(a)pyrene, or BaP, a substance which is carcinogenic to experimental

 

animals if relatively large amounts are applied in certain ways such as skin

 

nee - painting or subcutaneous Injection. This suggested the possibility that the BaP
ca “im ebgarente enoke might account for the high degree of association between
fo cigarette smoking and lung cancer; and it suggested the possibility thet BaP
- : . “pollution of urban air might perhaps increase the risk of lung cancer.
: . . Wynder and Hoffman found an average of 2.5 micrograms of BaP in the
smoke from 100 American cigarettes smoked mechanically. Based upon this, it
would appear that even during a lifetime of heavy cigarette smoking, the con-
centration of BaP per square centimeter of bronchial tissue over which it might
be spread would be extremely small 2s ‘compared with the dose required to produce
ekin cancer in mice. : ~
“Ine concentration of BaP in the air of large American cities is
reported to vary from about 0.3 to 6.0 micrograns per 1,000 cubic meters in ,
summer and from 6.0 to as high as 74.0 in winter, The air of British cities 18

od . more heavily contaminated with BaP. In some British cities/it varies from 73.0

ptr to as High as 170.0 micrograms per 1,000 cubic meters of air. During the course

of a year, non-snokers Living in some of these cities probably inhale far more
