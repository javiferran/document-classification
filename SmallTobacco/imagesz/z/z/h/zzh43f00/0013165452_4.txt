Discussion

The roofers studied had a high level of exposure to BaP for many

years. Their death rates from lung cancer were just slightly higher than the

rates

clung cancer death/ of men of the same age in the United States as a whole;

but the small difference was not : statistically significant. We conclude that :

1f a high level of exposure to BaP has any effect in relation to lung cancer,
the effect must be small. It is certainly trivial as compared with the increase

in lung cancer death rates associated with heavy cigarette smoking.

 

If a high level of occupational exposure to BaP by way of inhalation

results in little if any increase in the risk of lung cancer - then it seems
