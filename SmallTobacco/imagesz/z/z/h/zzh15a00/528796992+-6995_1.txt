RE:  _Relationship Marketing Significant Activities - Month of October

RELATIONSHIP MARKETING

GENERAL

Metal Match Lighter Recall

Through week ending 10/21, received 29M consumer contacts requesting materials to return
36M lighters. Bounceback of mailer kits to consumers awaiting U.S. Postal Service approval of
shipping method/packaging. Follow up/confirmation letter has been sent to recall responders
informing them that return details are being finalized.

DIRECT MARKETING

1995 Smoker Name Acquisition

* The Direct Marketing Group, Finance, and Purchasing developed a new strategy for buying
smoker names. The objective is to enhance the profitability of our database marketing
programs by using responsiveness as the critical factor in guiding our purchase of smoker
names.

In 1995, we will pay more and buy more from vendors whose names were most responsive
to our database marketing programs in 1994. We will pay less and buy less from vendors
whose smoker names were less responsive. MARC also completed a pricing survey of
other package goods manufacturers which we used to establish a benchmark price for
smoker names.

We completed the initial round of meetings with our smoker name vendors. We will finalize
1995 price and quantity commitments by the w/o 11/14/94.

Package Insert Test

¢ Direct Marketing group and Camel/Winston BU reviewed package insert program (PIP) test
conducted this year. Agreement was reached to terminate the test based on a collective
judgment that the revenue potential is not large and that third-party inserts increasingly may
diminish the impact of important Brand/Company communications in fulfillment packages.
