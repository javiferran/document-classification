PROMOTION FULFILLMENT

¢ Fulfillment Operations is currently managing 40 continuity programs to include fulfillment
and sweepstakes offers. During September, Fulfillment Operations received 274M orders,
up 13% from previous month due mainly to a doubling of orders received from CAMEL
Cash in September versus August. This increase in order volume is to be expected as
programs mature and we approach year end. Continue to anticipate increasing volume in
orders received for November and December.

¢ Initial Cash VI inventory of $6.0MM (942M items) has been ordered for a December 1 DTS.
Inventory will arrive by December 15 at Young America.

CONSUMER RELATIONS

« The overall level of smoker contacts decreased by almost 30% in September, representing
the lowest monthly volume for the year. Service level to smokers increased to 91.6% of all
calls answered. Contact volume is currently low because we are between program
introduction and expiration for most of our large promotional programs. We expect volume
to pick up considerably through year-end as WINSTON SELECT Weekends, 40th
Anniversary, and CAMEL Cash V expire. October volume is increasing as expected due to
SELECT Expert Panel, CAMEL Taste Mission and the motorsports conversion program
activity.
