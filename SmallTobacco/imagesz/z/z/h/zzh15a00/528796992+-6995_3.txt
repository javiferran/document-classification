CONSUMER RELATIONS (cont'd)

Consumer Relations will provide disaster recovery capability to support the CAMEL Store
Catalog program. Consumer Relations will assist by providing a small number of terminals
in a state of readiness in the event the supplier's operations are interrupted.

Installation of new automated telephone technology is underway. DORAL will be the first to
use the voice response capability with their planned 1995 program to provide order forms to
DORAL & Co. members. Use of this technology will provide consumer friendly service at
lower cost due to elimination of live representatives.

Consumer Relations will relocate to Plaza 11 over the weekends of October 29 and
November 5.
