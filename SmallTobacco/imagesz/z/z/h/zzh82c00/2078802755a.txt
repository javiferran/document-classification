Subject: Retail Leaders/RD's

I spoke with Randy Lawrence about roll-out of retail leaders and how best to
get the RD's in the loop. He's happy to do a presentation if they're ail
fogether, but since that's not happening for a while......1 think the way we
want to proceed is just asking the RD's to get in touch with VPRS's or SSD's
in their area to arrange to sit in on one of the roll-out meetings.

The new program is being presented at each of the current regional LEAP
meetings. One meeting for each of the 5 regions. Regions 3 and 4 are done,
but 1,2 and 5 still to go, so the RD's can call the corresponding VPRS's if
they'd like to attend for the 3rd day of the LEAP meeting (that's when RL
program will be presented). After that, there will be district by district
meetings with the TSM's to go through the program in detail. The RD's can
call their SSD contact(s) to arrange to sit in on any of those meetings.
