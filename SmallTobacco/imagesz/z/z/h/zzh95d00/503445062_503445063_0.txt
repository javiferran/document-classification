WINSTON Family
Copy Strategy and Platform

Copy Strategy

WINSTON's copy must convince Virile Segment smokers that
WINSTON is a superior family of products smoked by emulatable,
cut-above, rugged, contemporary, achievement-oriented men

who take great pride in themselves, their practical "hands-on"
skills and abilities, the active lifestyles they lead, and

the traditional American values and loyalties they share

with their peers. These men possess the distinctive form

of masculinity which enables them to work and interact
effectively with their peers, contributing their personal

best in the pursuit of tasks and endeavors which require a
high degree of teamwork, trust, loyalty and commitment,

and which result in a strong â€œbond of honor" or "Esprit de
Corps" between these men. Secondarily, the Brand must

proudly establish the perception that WINSTON delivers

smooth rich taste which is the best taste available, regard-
less of length or tar level preference.
