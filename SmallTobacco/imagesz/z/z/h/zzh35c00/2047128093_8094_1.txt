suits against the industry, and others are

ating with four of the five states. A fifth

‘Minnesota, said. A sixth state, Louisians, :
indicated it was considering filing a, suit:
and joining settlement discussions."
‘Lawyers for the Castano plaintiffs ¢on-,
cede that the deal is more generous than’

* anything they would offer to other tobacco
defendants. But they say the Liggett deal
increases their leverage’ to settle
other tobacco companies, °"..*.

significant as a settlement with Liggett:
and one of the other tobacco companies,”
Mr. Heimann says. “Furthering litigation. -

Before any money is paid, U.S. District

« Judge Helen Ginger Berrigan will have:
to approve the settlement. The amount of.

‘ fees awarded’ to. plaintiffs lawyers will

‘“also be up to her. But under terms of the
settlement, Liggett would pay them sepa-’
