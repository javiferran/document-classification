Drug Product
® Capsule/tablet dissolution
* Defined clinical formulation and preliminary analytical controls

 

Discovery Drug Disposition

¢ Define pharmacokinetic parameters (absolute oral bioavailability >20%)

¢ Confirm in vivo systemic and/or tissue drug levels (drug levels reach or
exceed in vitro potency concentration)
In vitre Cytochrome P-450 induction potential used to rank compounds
Single dose PK profiles in rodent and non-rodent species by oral route and a
reference route (i.v.) -nominal absolute oral bioavailability >20%
Enzyme induction in vitro — low or no induction potential in vitro
In vitre metabolism

Process Chemistry
¢ Preliminary nine-point assessment of chemistry:
Starting materials and reagents
Cost of synthesis and yields; synthetic issues, estimated material costs
Safety (e.g. high temperatures, gaseous acids, explosive)
Patents (including intermediates)
Environment / Industrial Hygiene
Toxicity (final product and intermediates / reagents)
Quality (e.g. current purity)
Scalability
