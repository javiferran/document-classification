PD) is also available but test compounds including SIB1508 have been negative so
far. This test is moved ad-hoc and late in the flow-chart

Symptomatic aspects of AD and PD:

Cognitive improvement following administration through the intended route of

administration is accomplished using:

- Object recognition in normal mice, possibly in rats (pending validation)

- the radial arm maze in adult rats. Similar studies in aged rats (18 mo-old) are
under consideration pending validation of the model for nicotinics

- Object recognition in APP transgenic mice (test in validation stage). The
APPLd2 mice (Moechards et al., see RPR238557 document) develop amyloid
plaques and have a very early cognitive deficit in Watermaze and Object
recognition. However, in the up-to-now tests, APPLd2 mice do not respond or
have a much lower response to nicotinic agonists because of a 50% loss in
nAChRs levels. Different tests conditions are in validation

Disease model for PD relevant to motoric function include reversal of reserpine-
induced hypolocomotion in rats and by evaluating test compound in the turning
behavior in the 6-hydroxy-dopamine lesioned rat model.

Disease modification aspects:
Neuroprotective effect of test compounds is first evaluated using hippocampal
slices by measuring the reversal of CA1 population spikes following glucose and
oxygen deprivation.
In vivo models of neuroprotection are investigated:
-kainate and metamphetamine acute toxicity in rats respond to nicotine but not to
RPR238557A (see report): test discontinued.
- chronic treatment in rats (from age 12mo to age 18mo) is also envisaged to

both: â€” -analyze the impact on the decrease of nAChR levels with age

- analyze RAM performance (18 mo animals are impaired)

Dependence liability:
Drug discrimination for advanced candidate (status equivalent to former EDC) is
conducted to evaluate the possible drug dependence liability of the candidate.

Toxicology package:
For each step in the Aventis preclinical and clinical development, the standard

packages of safety/toxicology studies are conducted ( rats , dogs)
