RESEARCH PROGRAM FOR IDENTIFICATION OF NICOTINIC
FOLLOW-UP
(Targacept& Aventis)

UNIFIED FLOWCHART FOR AD AND PD

Goal

For AD identify a back-up compound for RPR238557 (RJR1734) which would
have improved PK, physical drug substance, possibly safety profile and if possible
improved pharmacological properties

For PD identify a candidate for development

Strategy

Chemistry efforts are going on both at Targacept (Winston-Salem) and at Aventis
(Vitry).

A unified AD/PD flow-chart for characterization of the compounds has been
implemented (responsabilities shared between Targacept and Aventis) and is
described extensively in the flow-chart below .

Criteria for progression through the flow-chart are indicated after the flow-chart
characterization
