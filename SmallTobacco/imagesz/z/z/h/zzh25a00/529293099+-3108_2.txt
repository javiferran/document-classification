Primary Screens:

Objectives

|. identify compounds that have nicotinic potential through binding studies

2, evaluate their interactions at peripheral nAChR through determination of the
activation parameters for skeletal muscle and ganglionic receptors as a measure
of potential side effects

3. evaluate their ability to activate CNS nAChR relevant to AD or PD

Description

Receptor binding studies: The first screen to identify compounds having nicotinic
potential is through ligand binding studies using “H-nicotine as a probe in
membrane homogenates from rat brain. The binding affinity reflects interaction
with the ubiquitous high affinity binding site composed of the @4B2 subunits.
Compounds having an inhibitory binding constant of less than 1000 nM are
further evaluated. Interaction with the alpha? subtype another prominent
receptor in the CNS is evaluated through ligand binding studies using '*I-alpha-
bungarotoxin using membrane preparations from rat hippocampal tissues or
from the human SH-SYS5Y clone cell line (affinity for 04B2 at least 100 times
lower than that for a7 is desired). This assay is conducted on select compounds
after they have successfully passed the initial screens of functionality (see
below).
