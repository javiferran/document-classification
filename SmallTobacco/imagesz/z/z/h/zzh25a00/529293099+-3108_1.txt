Flowchart for compound characterization

The screening flowchart outlines the evaluation of candidates for Alzheimer’s
disease and Parkinson’s disease. The underlying general principles for the
establishment of these criteria are:

The primary screens are used to establish the selective nicotinic nature of the

compounds in vitro by:

1) identifying compounds that have nicotinic potential through binding studies

2) evaluating their interactions at peripheral nAChR through determination of the
activation parameters for skeletal muscle and ganglionic receptors as a measure
of potential side effects

3) evaluating their ability to activate CNS nAChR relevant to AD or PD

The secondary screens are used to establish the selective nicotinic nature of the

compounds in vivo (pharmacodynamics) and the relationship to pharmacokinetics

by:

1) Confirming the lack of potential side effects in vivo through measurement of
body temperature, heart rate and gross motoric effects (the latter is considered as
a potential indicator for side effects only for AD candidates; for PD candidates
where motoric function is compromised, increased motoric activity is sought)

2) Confirming the CNS selectivity by assessing cognitive function (AD and PD)
and motoric effects (PD only) of these compounds in early behavioral screens

3) Establishing the DMPK profile of the compounds

The Tertiary screens are established:

1) To identify CNS targets (micro-dialysis)

2) To establish acute efficacy through the intended route of administration in
animal models for AD and PD

3) To identify potential disease-modifying properties of candidates (neuro-
protection)
