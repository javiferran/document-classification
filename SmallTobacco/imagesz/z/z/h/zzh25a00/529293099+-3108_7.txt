horizontal and vertical counts. Positive outcome in this paradigm will be
established by a statistically-significant (p<0.05) change in locomotor activity
compared to vehicle alone. Effectiveness in the reserpine model and the 6-
OHDA model will be established by a statistically-significant (p<0.05) effect
on motoric function and turning behavior, respectively.

The Screening Criteria that are applied to the drug discrimination screen are:
1. No generalization to nicotine or

2. Acceptable separation between the dose that produces generalization and the
dose producing pharmacological efficacy.
