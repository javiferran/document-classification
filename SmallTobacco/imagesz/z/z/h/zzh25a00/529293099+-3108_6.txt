DETAILED SCREENING CRITERIA

The Screening Criteria that are applied to Targacept Primary and Secondary
Screens are:

1

2.

Binding affinity to @4B2 in rat brain with a Ki < 1000 nM, and

Binding affinity to a7 in rat brain at least 100-fold lower than for o4B2, and

. No significant activation of muscle type nicotinic receptor (1615) subtype

expressed in human TE671/RD cells (Ena, < 30% that elicited by nicotine at 100
MM or CNS/PNS separation greater than 3-log units), and

. No significant activation of ganglionic-type receptor (0384 subtype) expressed

in human SH-SY5Y cells (Emax < 30% that elicited by nicotine at 100 uM or
CNS/PNS separation greater than 3-log units), and

. Activation of nAChR expressed in rat striatal synaptosomes with Enax > 30%),

and

. Heart rate and blood pressure changes in rat similar to or less than those elicited

by a five-fold or lower concentration of nicotine, and no significant changes of
heart rate at | pmol/kg (at 1 umol/kg nicotine induces A Heart rate of 25
beats/min), and

. Acute subcutaneous studies showing cognitive improvement in scopolamine-

induced amnesia in the passive avoidance paradigm. Positive outcome in this
paradigm will be established by a statistically-significant (p<0.05) increase in
step-through latency compared to scopolamine alone, and

. Acute intragastric (gavage) studies showing cognitive improvement in the radial

arm maze. Positive outcome in this paradigm will be established by a
statistically-significant (p<0.05) decrease in memory (working/reference) errors
compared to vehicle, and

. Sub-Chronic intragastric (gavage) studies showing cognitive improvement in

the radial arm maze. Positive outcome in this paradigm will be established by a
statistically-significant (p<0.05) decrease in memory (working/reference) errors
compared to vehicle

10.For PD: Criteria 1 through 7 and acute and sub-chronic subcutaneous studies

examining changes in locomotor activity. Parameters to be measured will be
