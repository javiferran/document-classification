This street promotion will be conducted two days a week over

a four-week period and our major objective is to sample the
tourist trade rather than the local people. Consequently,

attract mostly out-of-town tourists. After these locations
have been selected, a meeting should be held with Mr. Greenfield
to ccordinate the plan, selection of samplers, etc. The
