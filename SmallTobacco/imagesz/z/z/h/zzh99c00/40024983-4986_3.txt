transformed cells by inseclional recombination with helper
virus {27}. This phenomenon generales a predictable ba
ground that sets the upper limit for the sensitivity of this assay
to detect illegitimate recombination.

Nevertheless, it may be argued that illegitimate RNA
recombination was responsible for the low yields of HaSV
regeneration in the absence af hamology with MoV. This
seems unlikely, however, because the frequency of iflegiti-
mate recombination between related retroviruses is much
lower than the limit of sensitivity of the assay described here.
This assertivn ts based on numerous observations that non-
defeclive Kous sarcoma virus (RSV) or Moloney sarcama
virus (MoSYV) was never generated in coinfections of either
defeclive RSV (28, 29) or MoSV (30) with their helper
viruses. Thus, Ulegitimate KNA recombination is numeri-
cally unlikely to be the source of the HaSVs generated here
in the absence of homology with MoV. The RNA recombi-
nation model predicts that recombinant sequences immedi-
ately upstream of the 3’ LTR of regenerated HaSV would
frequently be derived from MaV, whereas the DNA recom-
bination model via random Moloney provirus integration
predicts HaS¥- or cell-derived sequences upstream of the
MoV-derived 3’ LTR. Therefore, analysis of the recombinant
RNAs could identify their origin.

(ii) The DNA model provides more plausible explanations
for key observations in retroviral transductian than the RNA.
model. ‘For example, a siretch of 10 adenine residues in the
RNA of avian sarcoma virus PRCIL, following the 3’ border of
a transduced proto-/ps sequence, has been interpreted in
support of the RNA recombination model. Il was postulated
that the 10 adenines were derived from recombination with the
poly(A) terminus of proto-/ps mRNA {7}. However, the 10
adenines could have been derived from the transducing ret-
rovinis instead. {his is especially likely since the 3’ junctions
of the fps sequences of this virus and Fujinami sarcoma virus
are exactly the same (31), and since the 3’ fps region of neither
virus functions as a polyadenylylation signal. Further, a
stretch of 10 adenines is not compelling evidence for an origin
from the 3’ terminus ofa mRNA; for example, HaSV and avian
musculo-aponeurotic fibrosarcoma virus each contain one (15)
or even two (32) internal poly(A) regions of 24-38 adenines far
from borders of cell- and retrovirus-derived sequences. More-
over, no oliga(A) or poly(A) regions are found at the interfaces
between transduced cellular and retroviral sequences of aver
50 other oncogenic retroviruses (15), although most of the
respective recombinations must have occurred 3’ of the proto-
onc coding regions and thus near polyadenylylation sites,
because most viral onc proteins are coterminal with proto-onc
proteins (15, 33, 34). Thus, a single case of 10 adenines at the
proto-onc retroviral border does not lend compelling support
to ne RNA mode! and certainly does not exclude the DNA
model.

Clearly the DNA model provides the only plausible expia-
nation for the existence of at least six oncogenic retroviruses
with two distinct heterologous sequences: E26, AEV, MH2,
GR-FeSV, HaSV, and KiSV (in fact, three heterologous
sequences are present in HaSV and KiS¥) (15). To explain the
Origin of these viruses in terms of the RNA madel, one would
have to postulate that after acquiring one heterologous sc-
quence by illegitimate RNA recombination, the same retrovi-
rus subsequently acquired a second (and third) one, again by
illegitimate recombination. This is highly improbable because
Tetroviruses transduce heterologous sequences very rarely—
so far, fewer than 100 oncogenic viruses with transduced
sequences, including 6 with ras sequences, have been de-
scribed (15, 33, 35)—-and because all transduced and hence
nonessential sequences have half-lives of only several repli-
cative cycles in the retrovirus vector (33, 34). By contrast,
Megitimate DNA recombinations can be stored in cells as
chromosomal abnormalities that are consistently found in

tumor cells and also accur in normal Uissue (33, 36). Indeed,
untransduced recombinant retroviral-proto-one genes such as
the LTR-prote-miye genes of certain chicken leukemias with
and without teansfornung function have becn identified (37).

Tt Fallows that the DNA model is more plausible than the
previously favored RNA model (1-11) of transduction. [nthe
hypothetical case of 4 fortuitous homology between a proto-
one gene and a transducing retrovirus, RNA recombination
would be a plausible mechanism of transduction, as shown
here and previously (26), although DNA recombination
would benefit equally from such homology.
