rate in this study improves temporal resolution of the formation profiles for a chosen infrared cell
as a result of purging the volume of the infrared flow cell in less time. The addition of a second
heater downstream at a fixed position before the gas entered the IR cell basically created a
second reaction zone where the temperature was independently controlled from the first zone.
This also provided a practical way to react gas phase compounds under different conditions that
were used Lo create them in the first zone while also separating the effect of the solid phase on
the gas phase evolution. In the case of cellulose pyrolysis, the primary char formed in the earlier
stage of pyrolysis is left behind in the region of the primary heater, whereas the volatiles are
carricd away from the primary heater into the secondary heating zone where further reactions can
continue. In this way, primary and secondary reactions are distinguished from each other. The
present paper reports on this method of fast heating and two reaction zone cvolved gas
analysis/Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (Fast EGA/FTIR). The effect of heating rate on
the formation of formaldchyde, the pyrolysis of levoglucosan (1,6-Anhydro-B-D-glucopyranos),

and the post-pyrolysis heating effect on CO and CO; formation will be discussed,
