Analysis/FTIR (Fast EGA/FTIR) Apparatus.

Figure 2. Average Temperature Profiles of Cellulose Samples at Four Different
Heater Temperatures.

Figure 3. Formaldehyde Formation Profiles from Cellulose Pyrolysis at Different
Heating Rates, Note that the Time axis can be readily converted to temperatures,

Figure 4. Comparison of Gas Phase Infrared Absorption Spectra from Pyrolysis of
Cellulose and Levoglucosan. Same experimental conditions were applicd in the two runs,

Figure 5. Comparison of Gas Phase CO and CO, Formation from Cellulose
Pyrolysis. The Primary heater was sct at 800 Â°C and the second heater was set at different
temperatures.
