Summary

The real time fast evolved gas analysis/Fourier Transform infrared (Fast EGA/FTIR)
method developed in this study was successfully applicd to study the gas phasc compound
evolution of cellulose pyrolysis. The effects of different pyrolytic conditions, such as heating
rate, gas flow rate, and the residence time of the vapor phase in the heated zone, on cellulose
pyrolysis products were demonstrated. Tl was found that the final gaseous compounds were
significantly affected by the pyrolytic conditions applied. Cellulose samples treated with
different additives were found to have different yields of formaldehyde, CO, and CO, formation.
Both the maximum temperature of formaldehyde formation and the amount of formaldehyde
formed were dependent on the sample-heating rate. Levoglucosan (1,6-Anhydro-B-D-
glucopyranosc), a major component of cellulose tar, is found to be the major precursor of
formaldehyde formation. This was supported by experimental results on levoglucosan pyrolysis.
By this technique, evolved gases arc analyzed at fast heating rates and information regarding
formation profiles and reaction mechanisms is obtained. In the two heating zone experiments,
CO formation was found to be highly dependent on the temperature set at the second zone, while
CO: was only slightly affected by the additional healing, indicating further decomposition of
vapor products to produce CO, The two heating zone furnace provides links on primary and

secondary reactions.
