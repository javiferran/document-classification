Abstract

A two heating zone pyrolysis system capable of a heating rate of 40 °C/second and a
flow rate of 70 ml/second was coupled to a rapid scanning Fourier transform infrared
spectrometer (FTIR). This fast cvolved gas analysis system was applicd to the study of the
simultaneous evolution of low molecular weight gas phase products, such as CO, CO», H20,
CHa, CoHa, and CHO during the pyrolysis of ccllulosc. Different pyrolytic conditions, including
heating rate, gas flow rate, and residence time, were tested to study their effects on the formation
of gaseous compounds during cellulose pyrolysis. Efforts were made to achieve a well-
controlled heating environment and sample temperature measurement, Levoglucosan, a major
component of tar and a primary pyrolysis product, was also studied. Comparison of the pyrolysis
products from cellulose and levoglucosan showed great similaritics and provided insights into the
precursors and formation mechanisms of gas phase products. This experimental method
provides not only a technique to analyze evolved gases in real time, but information on reaction

mechanisms as well as a way to distinguish and control primary and secondary reactions.
