nitrogen gas flows through the sample and is measured by a flow meter. The infrared spectrum
and temperature measurements are started simultaneously. After about three seconds, the heater
is positioned where the sample is in the center. The heater block was moved in the same time
frame with each measurement so that the healing rates experienced by the samples were
reproducible. The sample temperature is measured and monitored by thermocouples throughout
the pyrolysis process. It should be pointed out that the "true" sample temperature is rather
difficult to obtain during a dynamic process, especially at a fast heating rate. The measured
temperatures in this study were averages of at least five experimental runs, and should closely
represent the sample temperatures. Post data processing included Fouricr transforming
interferograms to single beam spectra, calculating absorption spectra using the first ten single
beam spectra co-added at the beginning of the experiment as the background, and obtaining the
gas evolution profiles from the absorption spectra. A further reduction in flow cell volume or
increase in the flow rate through the addition of a make-up gas is possible to further increase the

temporal resolution recognizing though at the expense of reduced absorbance.
