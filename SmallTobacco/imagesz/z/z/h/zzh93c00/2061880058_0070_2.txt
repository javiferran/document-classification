ยง 6306. Furnishing cigarettes or cigarette papers

(a) offense defined.--A person commits an offense if
he furnishes to any minor, by gift, sale or otherwise,
any cigarettes or cigarette paper.

(b) Grading.--Whoever commits an offense under this
section shall, upon being convicted thereof in a
summary proceeding, be sentenced for the first offense
to pay a fine not exceeding $25 and for the second
offense shall be fined not exceeding $100; and for the

third or subsequent offense shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

The only reported case that has construed these two
sections treated them as substantively identical. In
Commonwealth v. Goodyear, 67 D. & C. 2d 5231 (C.C.P. Del. 1974),
aff'd in relevant part, 235 Pa. Super. 544, 344 A.2d 672 (1975),
the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County interpreted the
predecessors of Sections 6305 and 6306 as follows:

It is a crime to furnish tobacco to a minor:

Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, sec. 647,

18 PS ยง4647. It is a crime to furnish

cigarettes or cigarette paper to a minor:

Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. &72, sec. 648,

18 PS ยง4648. We must conclude that anyone

furnishing tobacco, cigarettes or cigarette

paper to a minor could be found guilty of

corrupting the morals of a minor.

67 D. & C. 2d at 524, In affirming the trial court's decision on
this point, the Superior Court reiterated that court's view that
the predecessors of Section 6305 and 6306 "make it a crime to
furnish tobacco to minors, and to furnish cigarettes or cigarette

paper to minors." 235 Pa. Super. at 548 n.4, 344 A.2d at 674

n.4. Thus, under Goodyear, the term "minor" as used in Section
