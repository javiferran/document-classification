Habecker v. Nationwide Insurance Co., 299 Pa. Super. 463, 472,
445 A.2d 1222, 1227 (1982); Fox Chapel Area School District v.
Punlap, 53 Pa. Commw. 479, 481, 417 A.2d 1329, 1330 (1980). As
demonstrated below, Sections 6305 and 6306 are viewed as co-
extensive by the courts, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human
Services, the General Assembly, the public at large, and the
government officials charged with enforcing the provisions. All
of these entities cannot be mistaken. Section 6305 establishes
the minimum sales age for cigarettes, and that age is 18.

Ie THE LANGUAGE OF SECTIONS 6305 AND 6306

PRECLUDES THE SUGGESTED ANALYSIS.
With respect to the sale of tobacco products, the

Crimes Code provides as follows:

ยง 6305. Sale of tobacco

offense if he:

(1) sells tobacco, in any form, to any minor

18 years; or

(3) knowingly and falsely represents himself to
be 18 years of age or older to another for the
purpose of procuring or having furnished to him
tobacco in any form.

(b) Penalty.--A person who violates this section
shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of
not less than $25 for a first offense and not less than
$100 for a subsequent offense.
