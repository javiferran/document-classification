B. Public Record

When the General Assembly amended Section 6305 in 1990
by raising the minimum sales age to 18, the general public fully
understood that the change applied to the sale of cigarettes as
well as other tobacco products. See, e.g., "Casey Signs Referee
Assault Bill," United Press International, Feb. 14, 1990
(amendment to Sectipn 6305 would "raise the legal age for people
to buy cigarettes and other tobacco products"); "House Raises
Penalties for Attacking Sports Officials," United Press
International, Feb. 13, 1990 (the then-pending legislation "would
prohibit the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products
{except] to those 18 or older. Currently, the legal age limit is
16.")7 "Nazareth Misses Health Message," Allentown Morning Call,

Mar. 28, 1990, p. A-18 ("A new state law raises the age, from 16

to 18, at which young people legally may buy cigarettes"); "City

2.(...continned)
a person under the age of sixteen years." P.L. 638,
No. 323, §§ 1, 2, July 10, 1901. In 1903, the General
Assembly replaced the cigarette provision with one
prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to "any person, or
persons, under the age of twenty-one years." P.L. 154,
No. 110, Apr. 4, 1903. This provision was repealed in 1913
and replaced with a statute prohibiting the furnishing of
cigarettes or cigarette paper to "any minor." P.L. 198,
No. 137, §§ 1, 3, May 9, 1913 (18 P.S. § 1174). In 1939,
the tobacco and cigarette provisions were codified as
Sections 647 and 648 of the Pennsylvania Penal Code. P.L.
872, No. 375, §§ 647, 648, June 24, 1939 (18 P.S. §§ 4647,
4648). The 1939 codification remained in force until the
1972 codification of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, when
Sections 647 and 648 were replaced with Sections 6305 and
6306. P.L. 1482, No. 334, § 1, Dec. 6, 1972. The 1972
recodification eliminated another provision dating to 1913
requiring minors upon request to divuige where and from whom
they had obtained cigarettes or cigarette papers.
