35 P.S. § 1223.5. As Representative Saurnan, the sponsor of the
amendment, explained, this prohibition was thought to be
undermined by a minimum cigarette sales age of 16:

Mr. Speaker, this amendment is one that we

passed last session toward the end of the

session, and unfortunately it was not acted

on by the Senate. What it does is increase

the legal age to purchase tobacco from the

current 16 years of age to 18 years.

Particularly, I_think this is important since

we have forbidden smoking on school property,
and this will make that easier to enforce.

1989 Legislative Journal -- House, p. 605 (emphasis added). The
administrator of the Health Department's Smoking and Health —
Program justified the increase in the minimum sales age by citing
"studies showing that half of all smokers start the habit before
they reach 18." Repeating the views expressed by Representative
Saurman, Ms. Vickie Newlin asserted that the new law would
"complement existing prohibitions against smoking on school buses
and school property." "New State Law Raises Minimum Age to

Obtain Tobacco," PR Newswire, Mar. 13, 1990.

Senator Dawida, who had sponsored a prior version of
the same amendment in the Senate, also understood Section 6305 to
set the minimum sales age for cigarettes. In explaining his
amendment, he stated that it "basically deals with raising the
age and clarifying the language allowing smoking, from age 16 to

18." 1989 Legislative Journal ~-- Senate, p. 1518.
