MEMORANDUM

March 26, 1993
RE: MINIMUM SALES AGE FOR CIGARETTES IN PENNSYLVANIA

This memorandum responds to the February 18, 1993
letter from Richard A. Lewis, District Attorney for Dauphin
County, Pennsylvania, to Ernest D. Preate, Jr., Attorney General
of Pennsylvania, in which Mr. Lewis requests that the attorney
General issue a formal opinion addressing the minimum sales age
for cigarettes in Pennsylvania. Mr. Lewis suggests that
Pennsylvania law prohibits the sale of cigarettes to persons
under the age of 21. He notes that Section 6306 of the Crimes
Code, 18 Pa. C.S. § 6306, prohibits the sale of cigarettes to
"any minor," and that the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa. C.Ss.
§ 1991, defines a "minor" as "an individual under the age of 21

years."

In fact, the minimum sales age for cigarettes has been
18 since 1990, when Section 6305 of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa. C.S.
§ 6305, was amended to raise the minimum sales age for “tobacco,
in any form," from 16 to 18. The minimum sales age for
cigarettes, as for other tobacco products, previously was 16, as

specified in Section 6305 prior to the 1990 amendment.

The District Attorney's reliance on the Statutory
Construction Act is misplaced. That Act itself provides that the
definitions contained in Section 1991 apply only when the context

does not "clearly indicate[ ] otherwise." 1 Pa. C.S. § 1991; see
