Cail, Mar. 29, 1990, p. B-3 (because of amendment to

prohibits children under 18 from buying cigarettes"); "Bethlehem

Allentown Morning Cal], Aug. 11, 1990, p. B=3 ("it is illegal to

"Councilmen to Propose Restrictions for Cigarette Vending
Machines," Allentown Morning Call, June 5, 1990, p. B-1 ("Under

state law, people under 18 are not allowed to buy or possess

cigarettes").
