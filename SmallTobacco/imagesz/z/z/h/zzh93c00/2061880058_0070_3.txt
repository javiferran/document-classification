6306 is to be construed to mean "minor" as defined in Section

6305 -- i.e., a person "under the age of 18 years."

The U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services
similarly views Sections 6305 and 6306 as co-extensive and as
prescribing the same minimum sales age for cigarettes and other
tobacco products. Summarizing the laws of the 50 states
governing "Regulation of Sale to and Use of Tobacco Products by
Minors," the Secretary's entry for Pennsylvania in his 1990
report to Congress stated as follows:

It is a summary offense to furnish cigarettes,

cigarette papers, or tobacco in any form to one

under 16 years of age. Violation of this section

is punishable by a fine up to $25 for the first

offense and up to $100 for the second offense.

Subsequent offenses constitute a third degree

misdemeanor. Reference Date 1972. PA. STAT. ANN.
Title 18, Sections 6305 & 6306 (Purdon 1983).

co-extensive even after the former was amended in 1990 to
raise the minimum sales age to 18. He commended Allentown
health officials for their "sting" operations against
vendors caught selling cigarettes to youths under age 18 and
for "mailing posters to cigarette retailers reminding buyers
that they must be 18 or older." "Health Officials Back

Cigarette Machine Bill," Allentown Morning Cal], June 8,
1990, p. B-6.
