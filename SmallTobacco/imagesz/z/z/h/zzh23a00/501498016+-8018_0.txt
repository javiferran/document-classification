SALEM SLIM LIGHTS CIGARETTES

Dear Mr. Smith:

Further to our recent correspondence and telephone conversations, we
are enclosing six printed samples of the SALEM SLIM LIGHTS POP-UP Store
Coupon which is to appear in the September 11, 1982' issue of TV Guide.

This Pop-Up 2-page insert, which features a store coupon, contains the
Code T~8146, is to appear in the Front Position in accordance with in-
sertion instructions previously sent you.

21,000,000 inserts are being shipped to your various printing plants in
accordance with instructions specified in your letter of July 23, 1982
to The Wessel Company, Elk Grove Village, Illinois, to arrive by August
30th,

When your plants receive these shipments of the "Pop-Up" inserts, we will
require from you, the consignee, a signed affidavit for the correct re-
ceipt of the shipment, that the skids and cartons had not been tampered
with. If there is evidence that a carton or skid has been broken into,

a complete inspection of the carton or skid must be made to determine

the quantity of cards and their sequential numbers, which may have been

removed.

Proper notation of this inspection should be made on the delivery papers
prior to the signing of the trucker's copy, and a copy of these papers
are to be forwarded immediately to the William Esty Company.

We require that the coupms be stored in a locked location until they are
required. Your printer must supply a written report and the actual
quantity of the press run. This report should be on the attached form
and submitted to the William Esty Company.

Any unused coupons must be returned at the lowest cost possible to:
