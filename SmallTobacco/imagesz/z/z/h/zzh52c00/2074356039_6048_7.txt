PREBOOKING INSTRUCTIONS

Revenue and gratis product should be prebooked when possible. Any gratis quantity that is less than one
carton should be paid using van stock. This wil! limit the number of checks for less than $20 that need to
be mailed to retailers. Accounts that receive more than one carton of gratis should be paid using
SFA/FSI.

When an account has not received its prebooked product, you may sell cartons from your van to gain
distribution. In this case, you should use the same rules described above to determine whether to invoice
the gratis or pay it out of van stock.

If you have any questions, please contact your immediate supervisor.
