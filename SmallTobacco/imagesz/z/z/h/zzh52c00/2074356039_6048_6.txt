Maintaining a Consignment Fund:
As noted in the Employee Code Of Conduct section of the Employee Handbook (Page III-3):

© Note: All Sales Force employees who have a consignment fund must have the full amount with them
at all times. The consignment fund should be comprised of cash, checks, cigarette stock,
jobber slips, or receipts for expenses. All employees are subject to random audits by
management without notice. If an employee’s consignment fund is found to be below its
authorized level, the employee has until the next business day to bring the consignment back to
this level. If the fund is at the appropriate amount the following business day, the employee
will then receive a written warning, and upon the next incident of consignment shortage will be
terminated. If the consignment fund is not replaced within the prescribed time frame, the

employee will be terminated.

If you have any questions, please contact your immediate supervisor.
