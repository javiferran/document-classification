Re: Effect of Aging on Cigarettes
Containing Added Ammonia .

Confirming our recent discussions, Dr. Senkus plans to conduct
a study to determine the effects of aging on the chemistry of
“WINSTON "A". He will obtain fresh product from the factory and
product from the market of various ages and have them analyzed
for the following components.

Ammonia in tobacco

Ammonia in smoke

Sugar in tobacco

Formaldehyde in smoke

Acrolein in smoke

Pyrazines in smoke

pl of smoke

Tar

Nicotine in smoke “

As a parallel to this study, we will have the same analyses
_ made on 2600-D product stored on the shelf and in the various
accelerated aging chambers. At the conclusion of these studies,
we will meet with Dr. Senkus to compare results and draw any con-
clusions that may be indicated.
