initial telephone interview, subsequently followed with a more detailed evaluation.
This methodology has been recently described, and is included with this letter Gee
enclosed paper). A smoking history as well as history of alcohol use will be

obtained from all first degree relatives.

Presently, the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the Bronx VA and the
Mt. Sinai School of Medicine follows a cohort of 100 Alzheimer's patients. The
sample and the number of first degree relatives it contains is large enough to
facilitate studies presently being conducted by our group, but not this preliminary
retrospective epidemiological study of the affects of smoking on the prevalence of
Alzheimer's disease. The proband sample size will have to be inereased from 100
to 300 to address this question, with a corresponding increase in the number of first
degree relatives. Increasing the probands from 100 to 300 will require 1 additional
full-time recruiter and 2 research assistant testers to maintain the first degree
cohort population, Thus, to carry on this preliminary pilot epidemiological study, 3

additional staff members are needed.

It will undoubtedly be necessary to assist some first degree relatives and
probands to visit the Alzheimer's center in order to confirm the impressions of the
telephone interview. When necessary, the personnel assigned to this project will
visit the study population in the community, in order to accurately obtain data.

Thus, an additional travel allowance will be necessary,

It should be kept in mind that considerable resources from the Alzheimer's
Center will be utilized to complete this study, and thus will be "leverging"â„¢ the

Counsel's investment. Specifically, the expertise to diagnosis Alzheimer's disease,
