PRELIMINARY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF SMOKING ON ELDERLY
POPULATION AT HIGH RISK FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE

The only proven risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) other than age, is a
positive family history of AD. However, it was not until work eondueted by
Breitner and Folstein that it beeame clear how powerful an effect genetics may
play in AD (1). According to these investigators Alzheimer's probands with
characteristic symptoms of apraxia or aphasia, have first degree relatives whose
cumulative incidence of AD approaches 50% by age 90. These results may suggest
that the most common form of Alzheimer's disease is transmitted by an autosomal
dominant gene, but the pattern of inheritance is difficult to detect in many studies
because most people with the gene do not live long enough to show AD. When the
mortality tables for the United States population are superimposed on this genetic
model of Alzheimer's disease, it is apparent that approximately one-sixth of all

first degree relatives will develop Alzheimer's disease during their lifetime.

Figure 1 provides additional evidence in favor of genetic causes in
Alzheimer's disease. This figure summarizes results from the study of
approximately 60 AD cases (probands) and 300 first degree relatives. As was
predicted by previous work, these first degree relatives have a cumulative
incidence of Alzheimer's disease that approaches 50% by age 90. Although other
models of inheritance could fit these data, the data are clearly consistent with the
suggestion that Alzheimer's disease is caused by an autosomal dominant gene whose

expression occurs very late in life.

Whatever genetic model is used to explain these data, it is clear that first
degree relatives of Alzheimer's patients constitute a group at high risk for the
expression of Alzheimer's disease, and that this risk increases dramatically with

age. Hence, this is an ideal population in which to study factors affecting the
