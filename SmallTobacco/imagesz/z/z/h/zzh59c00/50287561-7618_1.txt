expression of Alzheimer's disease, particularly when the relatives are over age 70
when incidence of the disease becomes greatest. This population would make an

ideal one to study the effects of a life history of smoking.

We would propose to study first degree relatives of 300 probands with
Alzheimer's disease. Our estimates indicate that this should yield approximately
240 first degree relatives over age 70 who are likely to comply with a longitudinal
study. If the mean age of this cohort is 75 and the cohort is followed for 5 years,
prior studies suggest that approximately 40 of these relatives should develop
Alzheimer's. It may be assumed that one-quarter of the cohort of 240 relatives
would have been smokers for a period of over 30 years in their life, and it can thus
be expected that two groups will emerge that are large enough to demonstrate a

difference in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease over the course of this study.

To determine the incidence of Alzheimer's disease, this eohort would be
interviewed, with standardized procedures that include detailed psychometric
testing and operationalized criteria for the NINCDS definition of Alzheimer's
disease. This includes the use of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Seale score as
well as the modified Blessed and MIT seales (2). This study will be a retrospective
investigation of lifetime incidence of AD among smoking and non-smoking relatives

of all ages.

Patients with Alzheimer's disease will be obtained screening nursing homes,
senior centers and outpatient clinies that are collaborating with the Alzheimer's
Disease Research Center. Pedigrees will be generated and at least two first
degree living relatives (if available) contacted as an initial sereen to determine

who may be suffering from a dementia syndrome. This procedure involves an
