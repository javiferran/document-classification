Fig. 1 Cumulative incidence I(x) as afunction of age x in first degree relatives
of the present series ({J, standard errors given in Table 1), and similar studies of
Heyman et al., (13) (O, data for compatible presentation kindly provided by Dr. A.
Heyman) and Breitner and Folstein (1). (A). The curve shows results predicted by one
simple plausible genetie model. The model assumes AD is transmitted by an
autosomal dominant gene with age-dependent gene expression described by a Normal
distribution. A population gene frequency of .06 was taken from an estimate by
Larsson et_al., (14). The mean (81 yrs.) and standard deviation (6.12 yrs.) of the
distribution were estimated from the data of Table 1 by programming a computer to
find the values which minimized the sum of the unweighted squared deviations

between predicted and observed values (15).
