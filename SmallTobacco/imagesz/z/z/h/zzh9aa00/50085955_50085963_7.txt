As previously stated, sampling took place on September 14.

Thus, if it is assumed that a rainfall on the order or one inch

significantly reduces the surface contamination of the leaves, then

as suggested by the data presented in Table III., a large portion

of the surface lead found in this study probably resulted from an

effective exposure of less than 10 days.
