4, Finally, the leaf solids were removed by straining
through a l~mm mesh plastic screen and transferred
to erlynmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of 6N nitric
acid.
These four samples from each leaf section were then analyzed for
iead content.
Five milliliters of a mixed acid solution consisting of
60% concentrated nitric acid and 40% perchloric acid were added
to each of the flasks and beakers. The samples were heated slowly
until the white fumes of perchloric acid appeared, indicating that
all organic material had been destroyed. The digested samples were
transferred to 125 ml separatory funnels and the flasks were rinsed
with alternate washiness of 2N nitric acid and distilled water. A
Citrate cyanide buffer and ammonium hydroxide were added to maintain
a high pH and the lead present was extracted with chloroform, using
Qithizone (diphenylthiocarbozone) as an indicator. The aGivnizone
formed a red complex with lead and the intensity of the color was
proportional to the lead concentration. The absorbence of tne extrac-
ted samples was determined at 510 mu and compared to a standard
