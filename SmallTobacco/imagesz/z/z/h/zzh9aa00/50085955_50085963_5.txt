Results .
The analyses conducted indicate that the lead content of
tobacco leaves is highly variable. Table 2 contains a summary of the
results obtained. The amount of lead found after the washing, soaking,
and digesting procedures are shown separately. The lead removed by

the first rinse is recorded in Column A. This rinse contained lead
which was loosely bound to the leaf surface. The results of the
three-minute soak are shown in Column B. The lead removed in tnis
procedure was also surface lead, but probably more tightly bound to

the leaf surface. Column C lists the results of the one-week soak.
Since some decomposition occurred during this period, a portion of the
lead removed may have come from the decomposed cells. The total
remaining lead, determined after digesting each leaf section in

nitric acid, is shown in Column D. The first two values (A + B)

were summed to obtain an indication of the tovai surface lead,

and the last two values (C + D) were summed to estimate the total
internal lead in each sample. These sums are reported in Column D

and E. The total lead content of each sample is shown in Column F.

Discussion

The results of this study indicate that significant quantities
of lead are present on tobacco leaf surfaces, and in the lear structure.
Surface lead values ranging from 4.6 to 17.0 ug of lead per 20 scuare
inch leaf section and internal lead levels of 11.4 to 38.9 ug per 20
sacuare inch leaf section were found. The data obtained from these
few samples are not sufficient to establish definite relationsnins
between lead content and leaf exposure, but in general the data show

that those leaves near the top of the plant contain higher lead ievels.
