The leaf samples were collected on September 14, 1968, from
Pour fields in central Kentucky. Green leaves were collected from
the top ("tip" grade) and near the bottom ("lus" gerade) of each
plant to observe the effects of age and exposure. The age of the
top leaves since reaching near-maturity size was about 20 days; the
corresponding age of the bottom leaves was about 75 days.
Plants were also chosen at different distances from the nearest
highway to determine the effects of traffic on lead content.

Tne information on the sampling program is summarized in Table l.

Anelysis
A twenty square inch (tone square each) section was
cut from each leaf, and these samples were subjected to the
following procedures:
i. Each sample was rinsed on both sides with 100 ni
of double-distilled (in glass) water from a wash
yottle. The rinse water was collected in erlynneyer
flasks.
2. Each sample was then soaked in 300 ml of double-

Gistilled water for three minutes. The beakers were

D

agitated by hand during this soaking period.

3. Hach sample was transferred to a closed flask
containing 300 ml of double-distilled water and
allowed to soak for one week. The leaves began to
decompose during this period, imparting a dark brown

color to the water,
