2t was suspected that the leaves taken from the center of the paten
(protected from winds) would contain more lead, but this was not
shown, Likewise, the suspected relationship between lead content
and traffic density was not found. Future studies should be
conducted using a large number of samples to better establish

any trends which may be present.

the average ratio of internal lead to total lead for the
samples collected in the field near Lexington was 0.407. The
corresponding average ratio for the samples collected in the field
near Sulphur was 0.400. However, the internal/total ratio for the
samples collected from the fields near Campbellsburg was only 0.316.
This difference may be due to higher airborne lead pollutior. in
the Campbelisburg area (which is unlikely) or less uptake of lead
from the soil. Future studies should include soil analyses and
several long-term air samples in each field where leaf samples
are collected.

It should be noted that the 19685 growing season in central
Kentucky was unusually wet. The excessive rainfall may have reduced
the lead contamination on the tobacco leaves to abnormally low levels.
An estimation of the rainfall amounts during the growing season at the
sampling sites was made by using USWB data from two nearby stations:
â€˜one station being located about 0.4 miles from the Lexington site and
the otner about 10 miles from the Campbellsburg sites and about 14 miles

from tne Sulphur site. These data are summarized in Table III.
