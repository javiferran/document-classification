SHOULD TOBACCO ADVERTISMENTS BE BANNED?

TRUDY GALLANT: Two years ago the Surgeon General
challenged the American public to achieve a smoke free society by
the year 2000. The American Medical Association has accepted the
challenge by proposing a total ban on all tobacco advertisements
and they support a bill currently in the U.S. Congress to do just
that. It may turn out to be one of the most heated regulatory
debates of the year. Should we ban all tobacco advertisements?
That's our question tonight on Both Sides Now.

NARRATOR: Live from the studios of Channel 56, Both
Sides Now with Beth Conrad.

GALLANT: Good evening. I'm Trudy Gallant filling in
for the vacationing Beth Conrad. In 1971, cigarette ads were
banned from television. Now there is a movement to go even
further, a total ban on tobacco advertisements from billboards and
magazines to matchbook covers. It would also prevent tobacco
manufacturers from sponsoring athletic and artistic events. Dr.
Bruce Dubin is the spokesman for the American Lung Association of
Southeastern Michigan and a lung disease specialists. He believes
that smoking is the number one preventable health problem in
America today and the advertising industry ought to be stopped
from portraying smoking as an acceptable social habit.

Scott Stapf is an assistant to the president of the
TOBACCO INSTITUTE in Washington, D.C. He says that such a
proposal would get a dangerous precedent toward curbing commercial
free speech. He also says there's not a shred of evidence that
cigarette advertising encourages people to smoke. So welcome
gentlemen to Both Sides Now.

. Dr. Dubin why should we ban cigarette advertising?

DR. BRUCE DUBIN: Very simply for this reason.
Cigarette smoking is the number preventable, very important word,
