November 29, 1972

John Cunningham, Esq.
Assistant to the Director
Bureau of Consumer Protection
Federal Trade Commission
Washington, D.C.

Dear John:

It appears to be universal practice for cigarette companies w
@ advertise in Spanish display the required health warnings in English.
£ am enclosing several advertisements taken from current Spanish
publications such aS El Diario, ABC de lag Americas, and Temas.
In addition, I sawa lighted display sign in a subway station
advertising Kent cigarettes in Spanies, with the warning in tiny
Magtish letters.

Six cigarette companies are covered by the consent orders
which the FIC accepted on March 30, 1972 (Lorillard, Docket No. €-2180;
Phillip Morris Inc., Docket No. C-2181}; American Brands, Inc.,

Docket No. C-2182; Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corporation, Docket
No. C-2183; R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Docket No. C~2184; and,
Ligget & Myers Incorporated, Docket No. C-2185).

@ They will certainly argue that their conduct is in
precise compliance with the letter of the agreement, which specifies
the exact wording of the health warning. The companies, agreed to:

Cease and desist from advertising any

such cigarette unless respondent makes ..--
clear and conspicuous disclosure of the
statement prescribed in Section 4 of the
Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969
(Public Law 91-222) which reads:

ZL86 O8Sts

"Warning: ‘The Surgeon General Has Determined
That Cigarette Smoking is Dangerous to Your
Health."
[Order, t.] ’

The Order deLinies the term VMolear and conspicuous disclosure" ass
