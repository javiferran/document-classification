‘ A number of remedies are appropriate in this case. The
most important of these naturally is to require clear and conspic-
vous disclosure of the Spanish warning:

Aviso: HL Cirjuano General ha Determinado
Que EL Fumar Cigarillos es pahino (Peligroso)
a Su Salud.

An order could also require disclosure in poth Spanish .and English,
as discussed in the preceding paragraph.

Finally, since this practice has been in existence at
least since the consent orders were signed (nearly one year), there
is a need for corrective advertising. Many Spanish readers, being
unable to read the "warning", may have been deceived into purchasing
cigarettes. Furthermore, once the correction is made, the readers

© may have become so accustomed to not being able to understand the
message in the white box that they may neglect to notice it for
some time. Therefore, I propose that the companies be required to
run corrective warnings on all of their advertisements. The
warnings would explain the dangers of cigarette smoking in greater
detail, and would take up a greater amount of space that the
current warnings. | .

Finally, the Commission might consider requiring the
companies to buy space in periodicals which they will donate to
reputable anti-smoking groups in order to adequately acquaint
Spanish readers with the dangers of smoking. ,

. Naturally, any order should. not be limited to Spanish
© advertisements, put should include all advertisements which are

written predominately in a language other than English.

Please keep us fully informed of any action that is taken
in this matter. In addition, P.A.P.E.R. would like to request that
we be permitted to intervene in any proceedings, formal or informal,

that are instituted.

t would appreciate your thoughts on these ideas. Don't

hesitate to call for further information.
I'll see you Friday at the PLI seminar.
With best regards,

Sincerely yours,
