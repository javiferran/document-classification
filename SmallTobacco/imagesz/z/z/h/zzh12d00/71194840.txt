Attached is a list of promotions that I will report one month in
advance of the scheduled program start date to the Consumer
Information Center. I will get with you at the beginning of
that month to confirm the specifics of each promotion, e.g.,
purchase requirement, specific markets/trading areas, etc. If
possible, please provide a sample of each item for inclusion
with the form that the CIC has requested us to fill out.

Please keep me apprised as new promotions develop.
