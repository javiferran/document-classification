Gray Market

At the request of the Nevada Wholesale Association, a bill has been introduced in the Senate
to address the gray market issue in the state. Our Tax Department has reviewed the bill and
deemed it too poorly written to do the job. We are working to get the language contained in
the Georgia gray market bill substituted for the current bill text.

The most comprehensive ingredients disclosure bill the industry has encountered was
defeated in the Minnesota House Health Committee. A companion bill in the Senate has not

Senate Committee on Health.

Divestment
An Illinois House bill has been introduced which eliminates any future investments in tobacco

company securities after 12/31/99. While the measure does not require the liquidation of
existing investments, it does recommend a close review during the next year.
