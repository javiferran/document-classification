Cigarette Excise Taxes

A House committee held a hearing on the Governor’s proposal to increase the Maryland
cigarette excise tax by $1.00 per pack (36¢-$1.36). A full committee vote on the measure
could be taken as early as March 5. Leadership of the House seems to be favoring an
increase of 50¢ per pack in 1999 and 50¢ more in 2000.

The New Hampshire Senate Ways and Means Committee passed legislation raising the
cigarette tax by 25¢ per pack (37¢-62¢). The full Senate is expected to give the bill a
second reading and refer it to the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate is expected to hold
the bill in the Finance Committee while the legislature debates other pieces of the education
funding legislation.

The 6¢ per pack (21¢-27¢) excise tax bill in New Mexico passed the Senate and has been
sent to the House. The Governor stated this week that he would veto any tax increase bill
that came across his desk.

In Wyoming, the bill that removes the sales tax exemption from tobacco products passed the
Senate.

MSA Legislation

The New Jersey Assembly Health Committee has scheduled hearings on two settlement-
related bills - one to set up a Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund and another to require non-
participating manufacturers to pay into a reserve fund.

A California Senate bill has been introduced to implement the “renegade” provisions of the
MSA. A total of 12 bills have been introduced in the legislature that direct where money
from the MSA might go, and four more bills were introduced to begin the battle over tax
revenues raised from Proposition 10, the 50¢ per pack ballot initiative that passed in
November.

Settlement related bills were also introduced in Connecticut and Vermont.
