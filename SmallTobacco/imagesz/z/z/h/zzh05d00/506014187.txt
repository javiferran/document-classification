Dear Dr. O'connor:

I have cut and pasted the most relevant abstracts from what was left
of the search on ultrasonic extrusion after ordering several papers
which seemed most relevant.

There was much redundancy; I have tried to select descriptive, represen-
tative abstracts that represent the whole.

In brief, ultrasound applied appropriately to a forming device (press,
extruder, drawing device, etc.) does have a measurable positive effect
upon a formikp operation. This effect may be: decreased friction (in-
creased die life); increased extrusion speed; better surface appearance,
better uniformity; or combinations of these, taken so that the product
is better when ultrasound is used then when it is not persent.

|

I'm sure there are trade offs among these several effects, and I'm also

sure that the effect upon the quality and economics of forming the fuel {

source must be evaluated for the project at hand.

The attached four pages of abstracts will give the reader a feeling

for this applied technology, most of which dates from the 1960's and 70's

but originated in the late 50's. ~

I hope this abstraction of abstracts is helpful.
