The Liggett “Settlement” Doesn’t Change the Facts

The law isn’t determined by public relations.

That’s why courts and juries have consistently rejected arguments that the tobacco
industry should pay damages to smokers, and why courts continue to insist that states
cannot ignore the fact that individuals choose to smoke and states choose to make
substantial profits in the form or excise taxes.

Perhaps that’s why Liggett received such favorable terms in their “settlement.” Behind
the media hoopla, here are the facts:

¢ A $25 million dollar payout. But only if Liggett is acquired or acquires another
tobacco company.
Translation: nothing.

e A 25% payment from their profits. Liggett isn’t making a profit.
Translation: nothing.

We continue to believe that as a matter of law, the states’ Medicaid lawsuits are
fundamentally flawed.

Attorney General Grant Woods of Arizona may have said it best a few months before
he decided to hop on the politically correct bandwagon.

In May 1996, the Arizona Business Gazette reported that Attorney General Woods said
he “never liked the idea of filing suit against tobacco companies...such litigation made
little sense, particularly since smoking is a voluntary habit and cigarettes are
legal...After all, if cigarette manufacturers could be sued for the detrimental health
effects of their products, why not the people who manufacture and sell alcohol? Or even
red meat?”

He was right then. He remains right today.

And what do other lawyers in this litigation think of this “settlement?” Stanley
Rosenblatt, a Miami lawyer handling two cigarette class-action suits in Florida, who --
when he learned of the class action filed against and with the concurrence of Liggett --
told the New York Times: “This is a phony gimmick designed to enrich a bunch of
plaintiffs’ lawyers.” Rosenblatt told the Miami Herald, “I have to take a deep breath to
avoid cursing... This attempted settlement is a disgrace.”
