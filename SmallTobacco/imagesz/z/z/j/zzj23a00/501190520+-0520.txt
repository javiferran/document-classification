Re: SALEM Long Lights POS

The purpose of this memorandum is to confirm our
meeting of yesterday afternoon relating to the use
of “starbursts" on the SALEM Long Lights low pro-~
file riser card. The Brand Group recommends that

"starbursts" not be used along with the SALEM
Long Lights low profile riser card. This action
has been taken due to legal restrictions relating
to live advertising space on the POS item. Fi-
nally, it is understood that you will communicate
this information to Field Sales.

Bill, your cooperation in this matter is appre-
ciated. Please advise if you have any questions.
