Future Developments ;
Wholesale club scanning data will be available during the second quarter 1994 for a

total of 300 stores, including a census of all Sam's and BJ's. This data will reported
on as a separate trade class but will not be integrated into the all outlet combined data
due to the wholesale & retail nature of this business (issue of double counting sales).

Liquor store scanning data will be available during the second half of 1994.
Additional details pending.

Training

Due to the unique nature of this database and necessary changes to DataNet to
accomodate it, training will be a critical component of a successful transition. An

actual training schedule will be sent out shortly under seperate cover.
