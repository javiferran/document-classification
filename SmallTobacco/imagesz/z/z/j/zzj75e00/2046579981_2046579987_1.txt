Share Variances

Share trends and absolute share levels in the new Integrated Nielsen service are generally
consistent with the Expanded panel for most brands, companies and segments including
PM's products. However an absolute share differences between the two services is
evident for total RJR. This primarily reflects the Integrated services more fully capturing
RJR promotional UPC codes.

Other Issues/Features
* Monthly data will be reported 12 times per calendar year, with each 13 week calendar

quarter aggregated into a 4-4-5 configuration of weeks. This will provide a
consistent reporting cycle with PM financial tracking/reporting.

- Anaverage weekly volume measure will be available for each of the 12 monthly
periods to allow for trended volume analysis.

* Monthly data for each of the trade classes will be available from 6/91 to current.
Weekly data for supermarkets will be available from 1/91 while drug and mass
merchandiser scanning data begins 6/91. Weekly data for the 800 convenience
stores will only be available on a forward basis (beginning the w/e 1/8/94).

* Forward inventory will be collected in a sub-sample of 400 scanning supermarkets
monthly to allow for the continued tracking of days supply, out-of-stocks and share
of inventory in this trade class. Inventory data will also continue to be available in
convenience stores (on a weekly and monthly basis) from the full 800 store sample.

Â¢ Convenience store data will be segmented into small versus large stores (based on a
200 CPW criteria) to allow for tracking of this trade class by store size.

* Region and Section level data will be available for supermarkets, convenience stores
and all outlets combined. Drug store and mass merchandiser data will be available at
a Region level but not individual Sections due sample size issues.

- In addition to PM defined geographies (Regions & Sections), a total of 47 Nielsen
defined ScanTrack markets will be available for the scanning supermarket data.
