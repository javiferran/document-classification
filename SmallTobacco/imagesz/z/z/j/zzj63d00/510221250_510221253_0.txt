Correction to minutes of February 12: Page 3 #5. Temperature
‘recorders only shipped to Malaysia, no RH readings taken.

1. Malaysian shipment temperature readings returned -
results attached. Cigarettes sampled from this
shipment. Initial results show that Winston B
appears to be about the same as current Winston
International. Salems have not been received as
yet. “More cigarettes will be examined.

2. Marlboro without TEG appears to spot worse than
- Marlboro with TEG under 100°F/90RH. Results appear
similar with the Houston cycle. It appears that
Marlboro resistance to spotting may be dropping
slightly. Meeting of domestic development personnel
. will be held on 2/27 to review spotting standards
for domestic products.

3. Tobacco and blends ~- Flue cured, G7, G7A with and with-
out addition of humectants has little or no effect on
spotting.

Burley blends - slight effect - B3 increases spotting
slightly, B9 also.

Casing burley definitely increases spotting - increases~-
when B3 added - B3 and B9 increases spotting still more.
