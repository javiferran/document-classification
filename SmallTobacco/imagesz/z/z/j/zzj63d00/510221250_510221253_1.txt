Reduced B4 increased B2 on Salem - no effect on
spotting.

Sucrose substituted for reduced B4 with increased
B2 - no effect on spotting.

Conclusion: Humectants alone are not a major factor.
Casing alone is a factor and adding humectants to
cased tobacco aggravates the spotting tendency.

Stem tests ~- Winston 100 Lights, Winston B, Salem -
cut puffed stems seem to cause spotting regardless
of where stems are added and regardless of whether
the stems are cased. Winston B with 2% CPS does
not appear to spot worse than Winston B with 17%

CPS when stems are uncased. Test run on Salem
with CPS added without casing showed no difference
from Control Salem in spotting.

Going from 0 to 1% on CPS adds significantly to

- spotting. Increasing from 1% to 2% has a much
smaller effect. Avoiding casing on the stems has
little benefictal effect on spotting.

Conclusion on casing - high casing levels have a
definite effect on spotting. Casing application
method has an,effect.

G-13 - Cased G13 is not as big a factor as cased
strips. Part II burley has the biggest effect,

4. Salem series - 4 weeks test on closed packs.
Order has slightly changed.
Part

i_/Best on spotting -~B~ entire blend cased
casing diluted with 2x water level
elevated tobacco temperature
elevated casing and tobacco temp.
Control Salem
elevated casing and temperature
part II cased only

Papers - Schweitzer paper still not received
Ecusta paper extraction
A number of compounds found but none
that would relate directly to spotting.
