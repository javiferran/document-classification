’ . blends were’ reviewed, Three Samples of ccG-3 ranged 0.20-1.94
Ppm, and c-22 ranged 0.08-0.35 Ppm. When Considered with CG-3
Samples taken July 13, 1988 (range 0.39-1.20 Ppm), the data
indicate that wide variability in dicamba residues exist in
the ccG-3 blend. Since upper stalk Georgia tobacco has been
excluded, the data also indicate that other tobaccos in RIR
inventory also contain detectable residues of dicamba.
