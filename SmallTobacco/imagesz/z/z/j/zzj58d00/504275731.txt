Dear Mr. Calarys

When visiting with Mr. Kent Crouch last week, I
mentioned that we had one pallet of 29622 plug wrap
in which the porosity would vary past the tight side
(450 sec/100 mi/sq. -) of specifications and we
would like to have his appraisal of influence on
sealing. Mr. Crouch was agreeable to our including
this pallet in a forthcoming shipment. ~~

We plan to ship this pallet April 15 against your

order 71-08273-00. The pallet will be sent to the
attention of K. 0. Crouch and marked “SPECIAL POROSITY -
‘HOLD FOR TEST". At the time of shipment we will advise
you shipping details.

Your cooperation in making this evaluation is sincerely
appreciated,

“ Sincerely, y
