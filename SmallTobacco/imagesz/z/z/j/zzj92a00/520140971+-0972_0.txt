Salem Test Market / Green Zone
(Salem: #1 Priority Brand for NY Metro)

Dear Managers,

As we have discussed several times, the importance of getting a “Good Solid” read on the
share and volume performance in these small green zones is extremely important to the
eventual rollout of the new Salem nationally.

The reason for this is simply the fact that everything that the Green Zone / Green Team is
doing in our 12 test zones, is totally workable in the future FDA restricted environment.
Think about it, once the advertising goes away, the ground-up approach to introducing a
new brand may be the only way! Does it relate to a national introduction plan or is it too
expensive ... that is the question that is always asked. If you think about it, the cost of
one billboard on the NJ turnpike could totally fund the Green Team activities for possibly
a full quarter.

In the next few days, we will be sending you (if you have green zones) the information
on manual tracking of purchases in selected green zone stores. This is the only good way
to get a read on our business. It will require our SR/TR’s to call on approximately 5 to 7
stores each week to gather sales/purchase data from invoices. Once the stores show that
they understand what information we need on a weekly basis, we can then use Retail
Representatives and possibly green team members to gather the information on a weekly
basis. There is no other way ..... and due to the tremendous importance of this Salem test
on a national basis, we need to approach this project with a “Positive Attitude”! As
information, the stores that are willing to provide us with copies of invoices will receive a
weekly payment of approximately $20 per store.
