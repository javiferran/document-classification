7.3. Evaluation of Dose Response and Increase over Spontaneous Revertants
(Tables 20 to 38, Figures 2 to 5)

Without S9, negative responses were obtained in strain TA98 for both VIRGO-CA and VIRGO-
CC. In strain TA1535 and TA1537 all cigarette types were negative. Positive responses were
obtained for the 1R4F in strain TA98 and all research cigarettes in strain TA100. For. positive

responses, the overall maximum increase over the spontaneous revertants was between 1.8-
and 2.4-fold.

With S9, the responses for all research cigarette types were negative in strain TA1535, but
positive in the other strains. For the positive responses, the maximum increase over the
spontaneous revertants was between 11- and 44-fold (the latter for the 1R4F) in strain TA98,
between 2.8- and 6.9-fold (the fatter for the 1R4F) in strain TA100, and between 1.7- and
4.7-fold (the latter for the 1R4F) in strain TA1537.

7.4 Comparison of VIRGO Cigarette Types with 1R4F
{Tables 39 to 47, Figures 6 to 11)

The specific mutagenicity of the TPM of both VIRGO-CA and VIRGO-CC was statistically
significantly lower than that of the 1R4F: without activation, the specific mutagenicity of both
VIRGO cigarette types was approximately 50 % lower in strains TA98 and TA100, and with S9
approximately 90 % lower than that of the 1R4F in strains TA98, TA100, and TA1537.

Calculated on a per milligram DPM basis, a similar result was obtained with the exception of
strain TA100 without activation for which no difference was found between the mutagenicity of
each of the test cigarettes and the reference cigarette.

On a per cigarette basis, the difference was even more pronounced due to the difference in the
TPM yield between the two VIRGO cigarette types and the iR4F; the mutagenicity per cigarette
of the VIRGO cigarettes was approximately 80 % lower without activation in strains TA98 and

TA100 and approximately 97 % lower with S$ activation in strains TA98, TA100, and TA1537
than that of the 1R4F.
