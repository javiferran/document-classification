Addendum to Report P 0500/3237
Part of Study Repeated Concerning Strain TA1537

Ail Remarks

In this addendum, the results of the part of the study that was repeated concerning strain
TA1537 are given in Tables A1 to A27, Figures A1 to A5.

Strain TA1537 was cultivated using another aliquot of the stock culture. The mutagenicity of
freshly prepared TPM of the test cigarettes VIRGO-CA and VIRGO-CC and of the standarcl
reference cigarette 1R4F was determined.

The number of spontaneous revertants was again outside the expected range, here for a factor

of 1.3. The reason for this unexpected increase in the spontaneous revertants is not yet clear.

However, the other characteristics of strain TA1537 with regard to its genotype and response to
diagnostic mutagens were confirmed to be within published and/or historical data. Between the
first performance and the part repeated, there were no differences in the results (Figures A6 to
A9). In a subsequent study (INBIFO study P 0500/3273) using a new master copy received
from B. N. Ames, the number of spontaneous revertanis of strain TA1537 Was ‘within the
expected range. In that study, the specific mutagenicities of the TPM of VIRGO-CA and 1R4F
were comparable with the results of the present study (Figures A8 and A9). Therefore, the
results of the present study can be used: the specific mutagenicity values are considered to be

valid.
