The TPM of the test cigarettes was prepared using 80 to 85 cigarettes per batch °. The TPM of
the standard reference cigarette 1R4F was prepared using 20 cigarettes per batch. Four TPM
batches were prepared from each cigarette type.

Each TPM batch was collected on 2 separate glass fiber filters (45 mm diameter) to prevent
overloading of a single filter. The TPM from the 2 filters per batch was processed together. It
was extracted with 16 ml of dimethy! sulfoxide (DMSO) and separated from the glass fibers by
centrifugation. The TPM-DMSO suspensions were stored at -75 °C until use.

For each test substance batch, the energy level, the yields of TPM, water, and nicotine as well
as the puff count were determined. The dry particulate matter (DPM) was caiculated.

On the day of the first mutagenicity determination, the TPM samples were thawed and diluted
to the final concentration with DMSO, portioned in aliquots for the other days of mutagenicity
determination, and stored at -75 °C. The aliquots of the TPM samples were thawed on the day
of the mutagenicity determination and kept at room temperature during the assay. They were
assayed in triplicate (replicate plating) at the doses 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 ug TPM per
plate for the test cigarettes and 50, 100, 200, 400, and 1000 ug TPM for the standard reference
cigarette 1R4F. The application volume was 100 ul per plate.

The procedures and determinations were carried out according to SOPs AC 46, 47, 74, 110,
120, 142, 177, 182, 193, and 194; IN RM1 and RM4; IT A43.

For the part that was repeated, 90 cigarettes per batch were used (see addendum).
