The Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 were used to detect
mutagens which induce frameshift mutation and base-pair substitution. These strains,
developed by Dr. Bruce N. Ames, Department of Biochemistry, University of California,

Berkeley (U.S.A.), were received either from his laboratory (TA98, TA100) or from GSF ?
(TA1535, TA1537).

The tester strains are histidine auxotrophic mutants (TA98: hisD3052, TA100 and TA1535:
hisG46, TA1537: hisC3076) derived from Salmonella typhimurium LT2. Mutation events are
detectable in the tester strain bacteria by their reversion from histidine auxotrophy to
prototrophy, which enables growth on histidine-deficient minimal glucose agar plates.

The sensitivity of the tester strains to mutagenic compounds is enhanced by additional
mutations such as the rfa wall mutation (resulting in an increase of permeability to large
molecules) and a deletion in the uvrB gene (resulting in a deficient DNA excision repair
system). In addition, TA98 and TA100 contain the plasmid pKM101 with the R-factor (resulting
in an enhancement of an error-prone DNA repair system).

The bacteria were maintained as stock cultures at -196 °C with 0.09 ml DMSO/mI culture. They
were prepared from overnight cultures inoculated with the first cultivation of the master copies
originally received (only TA98 and TA100),

Approximately 10 pl of the thawed stock culture was used as inoculum for a fresh overnight
culture. The tester strain bacteria were cultivated in 30 ml nutrient broth at 36 + 1 °C ina
shaking incubator at 200 rpm (circular orbit: 19 mm) for approximately 11 h before harvest. The
bacteria grew to a late logarithmic/early stationary growth phase.
