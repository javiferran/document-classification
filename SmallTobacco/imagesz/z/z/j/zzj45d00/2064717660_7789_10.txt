Reproducibility was assumed when the responses for at least 3 batches from the same
cigarette type showed the same statistical result. Reproducibility was questionable when the
statistical results for 2 batches were different from those for the other 2 batches.

 

For the determination of a positive response, the two criteria given in OECD guideline 471

ve were used:

criterion 1: reproducible and statistically significant dose-related increase in the number of
revertants,

 

criterion 2: reproducible and statistically significant positive response for at least one of the
doses.

a A response was considered positive if one of the criteria was met. A response was considered
1 : negative if neither of the criteria was met. The response of a criterion was considered equivocal
; when the reproducibility was questionable; in such a case, the response of the other criterion
was taken into account for the final overall evaluation.

 

 

The statistical tests were carried out according to SOPs MB 60 and CS DA2.
