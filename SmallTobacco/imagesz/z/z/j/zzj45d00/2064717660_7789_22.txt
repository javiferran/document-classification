6 Statistics and Evaluations

The arithmetic mean and as a measure of variance, the standard error of the mean, the
standard deviation, and/or the relative standard deviation are given as descriptive statistics for

single values.

For each strain in the presence and absence of the activation system, the following statistical
tests and evaluations were performed based on the number of colonies counted of bacteria that
reverted to histidine prototrophy:

- linear regression analysis with Poisson-weighted data from the linear part of the dose-
response curve for each test substance batch. This analysis includes the calculation of the
slope (specific mutagenicity on a per mg TPM basis), its standard deviation, a test of the
significant difference of the slope from "0", and a linearity test;

- overall comparison of the response for all doses of each batch from each cigarette type
with that of the solvent control using the one-way analysis of variance (Sachs, |1982). In
cases where the overall comparison showed a significant difference between the doses,
the Dunnett test (Dunnett, 1955) for pairwise comparison was applied.

The mutagenicity on a per mg DPM and on a per cigarette basis was calculated using the
values for the specific mutagenicity (on a per mg TPM basis), the TPM, and the DPM yields.

The comparison of the mutagenicity values for each test cigarette type with those of the
standard reference cigarette 1R4F was performed using the t-test (modified according to Welch
(Sachs, 1982) in case of heterogeneous variances).

All tests were conducted at the nominal level of significance of « = 0.05, a = 0.01, and
a = 0.001 (2-tailed). No adjustment for multiple testing was applied. Results were considered

statistically significant at p <0.05.
