1 Abstract

The objective of the present study was to compare the in vitro mutagenicity of total particulate
matter (TPM) of mainstream smoke from the test cigarettes VIRGO-CA and VIRGO-CC with
that of the standard reference cigarette iR4F.

The mutagenicity determination was performed using the plate incorporation version of the
Salmonella reverse mutation assay in strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 in the
absence and presence of the metabolic promutagen activation system S9.

The specific mutagenicity of the TPM of both VIRGO cigarette types was statistically
significantly lower than that of the 1R4F; their specific mutagenicities were approximately 50 %
lower without $9 in strains TA98 and TA100 and approximately 90 % lower with S9 in strains
TA98, TA100, and TA1537 than that of the 1R4F. TA1535 showed a negative response.
Calculated on a per milligram dry particulate matter basis, a similar result was obtained with
one exception. On a per cigarette basis, the difference was even more pronounced due to the
difference in the TPM yield between the two VIRGO cigarette types and the 1R4F.

In conclusion, the response for the TPM of both VIRGO cigarette types was considerably lower
than the response(ofjthe 1R4F under the conditions employed in the present study.
