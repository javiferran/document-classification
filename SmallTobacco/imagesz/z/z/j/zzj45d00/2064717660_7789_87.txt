13 Storage of Records and Materials

Records are stored in our archives for at least 30 years after delivery of the final report to the
client. Samples of the cigarette types are stored in our archives as long as their quality under
state-of-the-art storage conditions allows further evaluation, but not longer than 30 years. All

records, samples, and cigarettes can be claimed by the client.
