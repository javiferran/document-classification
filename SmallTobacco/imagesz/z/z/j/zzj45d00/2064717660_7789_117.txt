Table A24 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE MUTAGENICITY ON A PER MILLIGRAM DPM
BASIS WITH S9 ACTIVATION, t-TEST

Remarks: date of assay: 09-APR-97 (strain TAI537),
mutagenicity per mg DPM calculated using specific mutagenicity,
TPM yield, and DPN yield values, mean of 4 batches:
relative difference: difference between the mutagenicity of
cigarettes B and A divided by the mean of them;

statistics: t-test modified according to Welch:
null hypothesis: both means are equal
