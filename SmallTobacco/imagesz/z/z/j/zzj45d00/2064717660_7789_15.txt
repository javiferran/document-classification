7 Results and Discussion

7.1 Analytical Parameters
(Tables 18 and 19, Figure 1)

The VIRGO cigarette types were smoked at an energy level of 23.0 + 0.5 J (mean + SD, N =
5400), thus, the target energy level was met.

Tne TPM, DPM, and nicotine yields of both VIRGO cigarette types were between 70 to 80 %
tower than those of the respective yields of the 1R4F.

7.2. Comment on Strain TA1537

The number of spontaneous revertants for strain TA1537 exceeded the characteristic range by
a factor of approximately 1.7, The reason for this unexpected increase in the spontaneous
revertants is not yet clear. This part of the study was repeated with another stock culture of
strain TA1537 using freshly prepared TPM batches (see addendum). {n the part re ted, the
number of spontaneous revertants was again higher than expected by a factor of approx
mately 1.3.

 

However, the other characteristics of strain TA1537 with regard to its genotype and response to
diagnostic mutagens were confirmed to be within the range of published and/or historical data.
Between the first performance and the part repeated, there were no differences in the results
(see addendum). In a subsequent study (INBIFO study P 0500/3273) using a new master copy
received from B. N. Ames, the number of spontaneous revertants of strain TA1537 was within
the expected range. In that study, the specific mutagenicities of the TPM of VIRGO-CA and
1R4F were comparable to the results of the present study (see addendum). Therefore, the

results of the present study can be used: the specific mutagenicity values are considered to be
valid. ,
