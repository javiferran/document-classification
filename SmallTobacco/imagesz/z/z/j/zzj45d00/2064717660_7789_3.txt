2 Objective

The objective of the present study was to compare the in vitro mutagenicity of total particulate

matter (TPM) of mainstream smoke from the test cigarettes VIRGO-CA and VIRGO-CC with
that of the standard reference cigarette 1R4F.

3 General Design

The mutagenicity determination was carried out in the Salmonella typhimurium reverse
mutation assay (Maron and Ames, 1983) fulfilling the criteria required by OECD guideline 471
(1983) *. The determination was performed using the plate incorporation version in a single
experiment with the tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 in the absence and in the
presence of a metabolic activation system consisting of a postmitochondrial fraction of livers
from rats treated with Aroclor 1254 (S9) and cofactors. For each cigarette type, 4 TPM batches

were prepared and assayed at 5 doses up to 1 mg TPM/plate. This assay is used at INBIFO for
the reproducible discrimination of different cigarette types.

This study was conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) principles
(Grundsatze der Guten Laborpraxis, 1994).
