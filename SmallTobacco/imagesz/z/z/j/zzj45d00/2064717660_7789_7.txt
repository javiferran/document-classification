5 Experimental Design and Procedures

5.1. Media and Reagent Preparation

All media and reagents, except minimal glucose agar for which ultrapurified water was used,
were prepared using bidistilled water. All equipment, glassware, and media used were sterile.
The chemicals used were obtained from Merck, Boehringer, or Sigma at the highest purity

available, unless otherwise indicated.
For bacteria cultivation, nutrient broth no. 2 from OXOID was used at a concentration of 25 g/l.

For plate preparation, minimal glucose agar was used, approximately 30 ml/plate. It was
composed of 15 gM agar, 101 mmolf glucose monohydrate, and of Vogel-Bonner medium E
consisting of 0.81 mmol/l MgSO, + 7H2O0, 57.4 mmol/l KZHPO, - 3H20, 9.51 mmol/l citric acid
monohydrate, and 16.7 mmol/l NaNH,HPO, « 4H,0 in final concentrations. The glucose and the
Vogel-Bonner medium E were sterilized separately. To remove excess water from the solid
agar surface, the covered plates were dried at 36 °C. The plates were stored at approximately
6 °C until use; maximum storage was 2 months. ‘

For the viable cell count, minimal glucose agar plates with sufficient amounts of histidine and
biotin were used. _

The top agar technique was used to plate the bacteria together with the test substance and the
activation system. The top agar was composed of 5.5 g/l agar, 78 mmol/I NaCi, 0.05 mmol/l
L-histidine-HCl monohydrate, and 0.05 mmol/l biotin. The histidine-biotin solution was sterilized
separately and added to the remelted agar-NaCl solution prior to use. The top agar mixture was
stored at approximately 45 °C prior to use.
