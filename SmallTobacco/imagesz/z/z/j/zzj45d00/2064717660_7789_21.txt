As mutagenicity can only be reliably determined ai nontoxic test substance dose levels, the
plates were checked for signs of cytotoxicity during counting. No signs of cytotoxicity were
observed, e.g., neither a reduction in the mean number of revertants per plate when compared
to the mean solvent control value nor a macroscopically visible thinning of the background lawn

of the bacteria on the mutagenicity plates, sometimes accompanied by the appearance of
microcolonies,

In order to check the test substance for bacterial contaminants that could interfere with the
mutagenicity assay, the highest dose of each test substance was plated on minima! glucose
agar plates in duplicate and was found to be contaminant-free (Table 17).

All criteria for a valid study were met (for discussion of strain TA1537 see Chapter 7).

The determinations were carried out according to SOPs MB 44, 54, 55, 85, and IT A53
