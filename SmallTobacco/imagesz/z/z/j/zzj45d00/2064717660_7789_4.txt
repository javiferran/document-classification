4 Test Substance
4.1 Research Cigarettes

In this study, as far as GLP requirements are concerned, the research cigarettes are
considered test substances; the TPM of mainstream smoke from the research cigarettes was
tested. VIRGO-CA has a cellulose acetate (CA) filter and VIRGO-CC a dual filter of CA and
carbon paper. The cigarettes also differ in their cut filler composition. For particulars regarding
the research cigarettes see Table 1.

Table 1 Particulars Regarding the Research Cigarettes

The test cigarettes were provided by PM Richmond, VA, U.S.A., and the standard reference
cigarette by the University of Kentucky, Tobacco and Health Research Institute (for 1R4F
specifications see: Tobacco and Health Research Institute, 1990).

The research cigarettes were distinguishable by their length and tipping paper color (Table 1).
Determinations to confirm the composition of the blend and the uniformity and stability of the
research cigarettes were not performed at this testing facility for reasons of feasibility.
