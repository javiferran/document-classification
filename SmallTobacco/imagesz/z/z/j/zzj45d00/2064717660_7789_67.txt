Table 43 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE MUTAGENICITY ON A PER MILLIGRAM
DPM BASIS WITHOUT ACTIVATION, t-TEST

Remarks: date of assay: 25-FEB-97 (strain TAQ8),
26-FEB-97 (strain TA100),
04-MAR-97 (strain 1A1535),
05-MAR-97 (strain 1A1537)

mutagenicity per mg DPM calculated using specific mutagenicity,
TPM yield, and DPM yield values, mean of 4 batches;
relative difference: difference between the mutagenicity of
cigarettes B and A divided by the mean of them;

statistics: t-test modified according to Welch:

null hypothesis: both means are equal

| (a) negative response
