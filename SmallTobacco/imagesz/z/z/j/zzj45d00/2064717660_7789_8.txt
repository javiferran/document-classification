For metabolic activation of promutagens, the postmitochondrial (S9) fraction of the livers from
rats treated with Aroclor 1254 was mixed with a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NADPH)-generating system (S9 mix). The S9 fraction (batch no. 94-1, for preparation and
characterization see INBIFO study P 0500/5218) was prepared from male Sprague Dawley rats
given a single intraperitoneal injection of Aroclor 1254, 500 mg/kg body weight 5 d prior to
killing. It was stored at approximately -75 °C. For an 8 g/l S9 protein concentration, the S9 mix
consisted of 100 mmol/l sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 16 mmol MgCl. - 6H,O, 66 mmoli!
KCl, 5 mmol/l glucose-6-phosphate disodium, and 4 mmol/ NADP disodium. The S9 mix was
filter-sterilized prior to use and kept at 0 °C under nitrogen atmosphere during the experiment.
To obtain the required protein concentration, the S9 mix was diluted with sodium phosphate
buffer (0.1 mol/l, pH 7.4). The S@ protein/cofactor ratio remained constant (according to Zeiger
et al., 1979). The S9 amount was 1 mg protein/plate.

The preparations were carried out according to SOPs MB 50, 55, and IT A53.

5.2. Test System and Procedure

The Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation assay according to Maron and Ames (1983) is a
widely used and accepted assay for detection of the in vitro genotoxicity of a wide range of
chemicals. In the present study, the plate incorporation version of the assay was-used to detect
differences between the mutagenicity of the TPM of the cigarette types. The assay fulfilled the
criteria required by OECD guideline 471 (1983) with 2 exceptions: the upper limit of the dose
range was 1mg TPM/plate, and the results were not confirmed in an independent assay
because 4 batches of TPM per cigarette type were tested.
