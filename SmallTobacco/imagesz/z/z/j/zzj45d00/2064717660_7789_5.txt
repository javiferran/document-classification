4.2. TPM Preparation, Dosing, and Analyses

The research cigarettes were conditioned at approximately 22°C and approximately 60 %
relative humidity in basic conformity with ISO standard 3402 (1991).

The research cigarettes were smoked in basic conformity with [SO standard 3308 (1991), some
deviations (e.g., rectangular puff profile, free smoking; for the test cigarettes: fixed
8 puffs/cigarette) being necessary for technical reasons. The test cigarettes were smoked on a
modified 30-port INBIFO smoking machine, type USM85, using a 4-piston pump (Battelle) for
vacuum generation and equipped with 30 electric heaters °, at a total mean target energy level
of 23 + 0.5 J in the 2-phase pulse density modulation heating mode (PDM2-5) (Table 2). The
standard reference cigarette 1R4F was smoked to a butt length of 35 mm using a conventional
30-port INBIFO smoking machine, type SM85, connected to a vacuum system.
