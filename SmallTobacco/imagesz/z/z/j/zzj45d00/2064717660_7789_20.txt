In order to confirm the sensitivity of the indicator organisms, the responsiveness of the tester
strains was determined in each mutagenicity assay using the positive control substances
daunomycin, which is diagnostic for strain TA98; methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), NaNg, and
2-methoxy-6-chloro-9-(3-(2-chloroethyl}aminopropylamino)acridine (ICR-191) for TA100; NaNs
for TA1535; and ICR-191 for TA1537 (Table 5). The strain-specific response to the diagnostic
mutagens was comparable to the results obtained in previous studies ? and those published in
literature (Table 6).

In order to confirm the effectiveness of the metabolic activation system, its activity was
determined by the mutagenic response of all tester strains to the promutagens
2-aminoanthracene (2-AA) and 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) for each SQ mix preparation (Table 5).
The mutagenicity of 2-AA and 2-AF ® indicated sufficient metabolic activity of the $9 mix and
was comparable to the results obtained in previous studies (Table 6).

In order to confirm the consistent sensitivity of the indicator organisms to the test substance
investigated, an aliquot of a mainstream smoke condensate (MSC) stock batch from the
standard reference cigarette 1R4F used as long-term control and stored at approximately
-75 °C since the first quarter of 1993 was assayed for mutagenicity in the presence of the
metabolic activation system S9 (Table 7). The specific mutagenicity value of the IR4F-MSC for
strains TA98 and TA100 was comparable to the results obtained in previous studies (Table 16).
No mutagenicity was detected for strain TA1535, and strain TA1537 showed an. approximately
80 % lower sensitivity towards MSC than strains TA98 and TA100.

The specific mutagenicity of the TPM of the standard reference cigarette 1R4F, which was
smoked and assayed in parallel with the test substances (internal control, Table 8 to Table 15),
was similar to previous data for strains TA98 and TA100 with S9 activation (Table 16). No
mutagenicity was detected for strain TA1535, and strain TA1537 with S9 activation showed an
approximately 90 % lower sensitivity towards TPM than strains TA98 and TA100.

* negligible deviation from range of historical data for NaN, in TA100: 10 % lower than historical mean
2-AF in strain TA1535 is reported fo be not mutagenic and in strain TA1537 to be weakly mutagenic
(De Flora et al., 1984). For these strains, 2-AA indicated sufficient metabolic activity of the S9 mix;
negligible deviation from range of historical data for 2-AF in TA98: 26 % fower than historical mean,
and for 2-AA in TA1535: 12 % lower than historical mean.
