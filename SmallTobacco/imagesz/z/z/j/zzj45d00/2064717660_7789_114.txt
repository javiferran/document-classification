Table A21 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SPECIFIC MUTAGENICITY OF TPM
WITH S9 ACTIVATION, t-TEST

Remarks: date of assay: 09-APR-97 (strain TA1537),
specific mutagenicity (regression coefficient): calculated
using Poisson weights, mean of 4 batches:
relative difference: difference between the specific muta-
genicity of cigarettes B and A divided by the
mean of them;
statistics: t-test modified according to Welch;
null hypothesis: both means are equal
