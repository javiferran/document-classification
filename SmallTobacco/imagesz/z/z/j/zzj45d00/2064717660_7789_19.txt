For plating: the test substance dose, 100 ul bacteria culture, and 500 pl SQ mix or 0.1 mol/l
phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, were added to 2 ml top agar. The components were mixed and

spread evenly on minimal glucose agar plates. After hardening of the top agar, the plates were
incubated in the dark at 36 + 4 °C for 44 to 48 h.

Each plate was labeled with a bar code that identified the test substance and its individual

batch, dose, metabolic activation system, tester strain, and individual plate number.

The number of revertant colonies that grew was determined automatically using a colony
counter.

The procedures and determinations were carried out according to SOPs MB 50, 55, and 85.

5.3 Test System Characterization and Criteria for Test Validity °

The genotype of the tester strain bacteria was confirmed for histidine auxotrophy by checking
the growth ability of the bacteria on minimal glucose agar, without and with histidine; for the
presence of the rfa mutation by testing for crystal violet sensitivity; for the presence of the uvrB
mutation by testing for UV light sensitivity; and for the presence or absence of the pKM101
plasmid by testing for ampicillin resistance or sensitivity (Table 3). _
The number of viable bacteria on the mutagenicity plates was determined using the pour plate

method. it was higher than the required minimum of 1 - 10° colony-forming units (CFU)/plate
(Table 4).

The number of spontaneous revertants in the absence of the metabolic activation system and in
the presence of the test substance vehicle was within the characteristic range for strains TA98,
TA100, and TA1535, i.e., between 10 and 50 revertants per plate for strain TA98, 80 and
200 revertants per plate for TA100, and 4 and 40 revertants per plate for TA1535 (Table § and
Table 6). The number of spontaneous revertants for strain TA1537 exceeded the characteristic
range, i.e,, between 2 and 20 revertants per plate, by a factor of approximately 1.7. However,
an influence on the results of this study is not seen (for discussion see Chapter 7).

The tables cited in this chapter are listed in Chapter 9.
