This experiment, and the results obtained using triethylamine in super-
eritical CO,, suggest the process to produce alkaloid-reduced filler can be
efficiently run as follows: : oe Oe

Initial extraction using trimethylamine/C0, ;

Alkaloid removal from extraction stream using water column;
Recovery of organic "flavorants" by C-18 packing;

Concentration of alkaloids by making filtrate basic and passing it
through styrene-divinylbenzene.

The last step must be demonstrated by experiment. If the alkaloids are
retained on the packing, then the filtrate should contain only citrate
salts. Washing the packing with ethanol or acetone will give a concentrated
alkaloid solution suitable for disposal by incineration.
