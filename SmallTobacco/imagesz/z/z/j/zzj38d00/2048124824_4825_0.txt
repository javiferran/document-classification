Capital Appropriation Request

Fabriques de Tabac Reunies (Switzerland)

- New Research and Development Building at Neuchatel
SF 20,097,000 (U.S. $12,180,000 at U.S. $1 = SF 1.65)

Authority Requested

Philip Morris International requests approval from the Board of
Directors for Fabriques de Tabac Reunies to spend SF 20,097,000
(U.S. $12,180,000) for the design, construction and installation
of laboratory equipment and furniture for a new Research and
Development building in Neuchatel, Switzerland. Previously
authorized expenditures of SF 600,600 (U.S. $367,000) for engi-
neering study and design are included in the above figure.

Background _ . -

The proposed Research and Development center in Neuchatel will.
provide services for. the entire European Region’ as local affil- --
dates have only quality control departments. The projected growth
in European production (from 76.8 billion cigarettes in 1979 to
157.6 billion in 1984), the development of new brands and the
addition of new technology will require greater and more complex
services from the R&D Department in the future.

The R&D Department currently employs 121 people located in six
separate buildings providing total area of 24,866 square feet.
Three of these buildings are rented outside the main FTR manufac-
turing complex. The physical decentralization of the R&D function
is believed by management to have a negative impact on current

and potential performance, particularly in light of the projected
departmental expansion.

Proposal

After consideration of the available alternatives, local management
recommends construction of the new building and elimination of four
of the six buildings presently in use. This will centralize the
R&D Department in the manufacturing complex. The building will
have four floors and provide 38,800 gross square feet and 20,700
square feet of laboratory and office space. It will accommodate

“the projected staff requirements of 195 people by 1985; however,

the building will be constructed to allow for further expansion if
required. When combined with the two existing buildings to be
retained, the total laboratory and office space for R&D will be
39,013 square feet by completion in 1982.
