TO: Editors and writers on women's subjects

Because the tobacco and health controversy has increasingly
focused on women and smoking, I am enclosing the latest Tobacco
Institute publication which addresses this issue. I hope you
will find a way to make your readers aware of its contents and
its availability, free of charge, from The Tobacco Institute.

Whether it be the issue of women and smoking, or any of the other
controversies surrounding the use of tobacco products, we
sincerely believe that a full, free and informed discussion of
the issues is in the public's best interest. We agree with

the American Cancer Society's conviction that, "adult individuals
must make up their own minds about smoking but, it requizes

that individuals know the facts."

For too long, adversaries of tobacco have attempted to influence
those adult personal decisions, as well as public policy, with
assumptions, opinions or conjectures not supported by scientific
or medical fact.

FACT OR FANCY? was produced to present more factual, and balanced,
answers on tne health question about which mature women need
to know more.

If we may provide any further information to you or your readers,
please contact me. I have included our toll-free telephone
number for the use of anyone desiring additional information or
a copy of this publication.

Additionally, please consider The Tobacco Institute as a ref-
erence source the next cime you have occasion to write about
any aspect of the tobacco industry or the controversies
surrounding the use of tobacco products.

Sincerely,

Sn eT
Anne H. Duffin
