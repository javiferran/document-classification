Some unexpected results are to be seen.

The efficiency of the Celanese G240/25 module is at the same gas speed lower than
that of the Celanese G240/11 module.
This was not expected because the residence time of the air in the G240/25 module is

larger than in the G240/11 module.

- The filtration efficiency for NO, for the modules with 0.6 mm fibres, Enka LM2P06
and Enka MDO20FP2N, is very low and lower than for the other modules. The
measurements with the MDO20FP2N module were, however, performed with higher
NO, concentrations (about 1300 ppb).

Previous measurements with the Enka LM2P06 module showed an efficiency of 60%

at 1.5 m/s and 47% at 3 ms with a NO, concentration of 250 ppm.

Required membrane surface area

The required membrane surface area for treatment of 100 m%/h of air is much larger for the
Celanese fibres than for the Enka fibres of 0.6 and 1.8 mm. The risk for clogging is higher
for the Celanese fibres: the fibre diameter is very small (0.24 mm). The use of the Celanese

fibres is therefore less desirable. 2501013711

The Enka modules with 1.8 mm fibres MDO20CP2N have the smallest pressure drop and the
smallest required membrane surface area.The specific membrane surface area is less: 400

m?/m3, for the 0.6 mm fibre modules 800 m2/m3.

The filtration efficiencies at the surne gas speed are for the Enka LM2P06 with 0.6 mm fibres
comparable with those for the Enka MDO20CP2N with 1.8 mm fibres, with the exception of
NO,,.
