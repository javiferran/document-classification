IL CONCLUSION _

This study shows that with a membrane stripper a high degree of removal (>95%) is possible
for water soluble components as found in ETS in combination with tap water as the absorp-
tion liquid. The pressure drop is low, down to 3 mbar.

The sensory filtration efficiency is in the order of 50% which is lower than the efficiency for
the water soluble components. This indicates that the sensorically perceived components are
mainly not or poorly soluble in water,

To realise a complete high efficiency cleaning system for all componenets in ETS an addi-
tional filtration step is required for the non water soluble components. This probably can be
realised with a membrane module combined with an organic absorption liquid. To develop
such a system future research should be directed to:

: demonstration of long term efficiency of membrane stripper.

- scale up of membrane stripper (cross flow module).

- development of filtration step for components not soluble in water.

- evaluation of comparability of both methods for the determination of the sensorically

perceived air quality (dilution method and decipol method).
