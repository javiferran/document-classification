2.1 Optimalisation of the membrane stripper

The relevant parameters for filters (generally) are;

- the filtration efficiency of pollutants:

9695 101062

- the resistance against air flow (pressure drop),

For membrane filters, the filtration efficiency increases with thinner and longer fibres, but
then also the pressure drop increases. The pressure drop increases with the air flow (linearly
if the air flow is laminar).

The optimalisation has been performed with six small scale modules with different fibre
lengths and fibre diameters. The filtration efficiency of each module is determined with at

least three different gas flow rates in the range of 2 - 30 l/min.
