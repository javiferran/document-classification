8 SELECTION OF THE OPTIMAL MEMBRANE MODULE

The optimal membrane module should be selected for application in an air cleaner to remove

the gaseous compounds of ETS.

In Table 6 the results of the efficiency measurements are summarised for the six investigated
membrane modules. To make a good comparison possible also the pressure drop and the

surface area of the membrane required to treat 100 m/h air are mentioned.
