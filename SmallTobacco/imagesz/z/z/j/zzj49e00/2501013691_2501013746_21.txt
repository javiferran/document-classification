The pressure drop of the module with 1.8 mm fibres is about twice as low as of the module
with 0.6 mm fibres. The required membrane surface area is also almost twice as low.
The specific surface area of the module with 0.6 mm fibres is higher: the resulting instrument

volume of the module with 0.6 mm fibres is about 10 % smaller than that of a module with

1.8 mm fibres,
The use of 1.8 mm fibres is preferred above the 0.6 mm fibres.

The influence of the fibre length is also investigated.
For the 1.8 mm fibres experiments were carried out with both a single and two modules in

series. The filtration efficiencies at the same air speeds are higher for the double module.

However, at a double membrane length and a twice as high air speed (same retention time in
the module), the filtration efficiencies are comparable for the single and double modules.

The required membrane surface area is also equal. However, the pressure drop of the single

module is much less.

The use of a single module is preferred above the double module.
