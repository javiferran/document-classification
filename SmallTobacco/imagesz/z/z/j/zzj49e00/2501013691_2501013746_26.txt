The efficiency for amines and phenol cannot be determined.

The detection limit for amines is 50 ug per sample per amine.

Contents of all amines in all air samples were below the detection limit.

The detection limit for phenol is 5 jig/sample.

For the inlet the phenol contents were just above the detection limit and for the outlet below
the detection limit.

The relatively high concentrations of acetone and styrene on 4/12/1991 are due to activities in

the adjacent room on production of polyester products.

The filtration efficiency was high, at least 95 % for all water soluble compounds. The effi-
ciency for NO2 was inconsistent again: for the two experiments under identical

conditions 94 and 49 %. The inlet concentrations were comparable. They were normal for

indoor air without smoking.

The filtration efficiency was, as could be expected with water as a liquid, low for aromatic

and aliphatic hydrocarbons.
The origin of these compounds was only partly from ETS.
The concentrations of the alkanes were slightly increased for indoor rooms without smoking;

those of the aromatic hydrocarbons were increased especially for benzene (see Table 8, [2]).
