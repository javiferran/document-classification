4 PURCHASE OF COMMERCIAL AVAILABLE SMALL SCALE
MEMBRANE MODULES

Membranes with a fibre diameter of 0.24 mm have been purchased from Hoechst Celanese.
Membranes with a fibre diameter of 0.6 and 1.8 mm have been bought from Enka Microdyn.
Modules with two different fibre lengths have been purchased for all different fibre diam-
eters. Only for the 1.8 mm fibre diameter one fibre length was available (0.5 m). For this
module Enka Microdyn delivered a special connector to combine two modules; in this way a
module with a fibre length of 1.0 m could be simulated.

The data of the membrane modules are listed in the Appendix.
