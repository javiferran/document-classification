The average concentration in the inlet air was 640 0.u./m? (95 % confidential interval 430 -

960 0.u./m3); in the outlet air 230 0./u./m (95 % interval 155-345 o.u./m),

The calculated filtration efficiency is therefore:

640 - 230
x 100 % = 65 %.
640

The 95 % -interval is 45 -85 % efficiency.

The results of the decipol measurements are given in Table 10.
The panel evaluated the air before and after the filter twice on the same day.

The respirable dust concentration in the inlet air was 2.0 + 0.5 mg/m3 during the experiments.
