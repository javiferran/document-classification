3 INSTRUMENTATION
3.1 Generation of the test atmosphere

The gases were generated in a test chamber: the air in the chamber was completely mixed

with a fan.

Formaldehyde was generated by particle boards. Four boards of 1 * 2 m were exposed to the
air at both sides in a test chamber with a volume of 15 m3: thus the loading was 1.07 m2/m3.
The temperature was 23Â°C and the relative humidity 45%. The ventilation was 15 m3/h (air
change rate 1.0 h-1).

The concentration in the chamber was 120 lig/m? formaldehyde.

Nitrogen dioxide was supplied by a lecture bottle.

Ammonia was also supplied by a lecture bottle.

Acetone was generated by placing a glass container filled with acetone in the room. The
measurements were carried out after getting an equilibrium between evaporation and ventila-

tion.
