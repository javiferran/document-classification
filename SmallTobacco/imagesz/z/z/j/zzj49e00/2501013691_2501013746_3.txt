1 INTRODUCTION

Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) contains several hundreds of chemical components, both
in the particulate phase and the gaseous phase. In rooms, where smokers are present, the non
smoking persons may experience nuisance and irritations by the unvoluntary exposure to
ETS.

Existing guidelines for ventilation of homes and offices are insufficient to guarantee a good

air quality if smokers are present.

It is not practical to install mechanical ventilation systems with enough capacity to prevent
the mentioned problem.

A possibility to improve the indoor air quality is the use of portable air cleaners, which
recirculate the air through a filter system in the room where inhabitants smoke.

Existing air cleaners contain a particulate air filter (electronic and cloth filters) and sometimes
also a charcoal filter. However, these filters are not suitable for most of the gaseous compo-
nents generated by smoking of tobacco.

In this research program the technical feasibility of a membrane stripper as high efficiency air

cleaner for ETS has been investigated.
