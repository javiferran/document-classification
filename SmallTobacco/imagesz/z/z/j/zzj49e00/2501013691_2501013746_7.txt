The pressure drop was measured as a function of the gas flow in the same range, correspon-
ding with pressure drops in the range 1 - 30 mbar (100 - 3000 Pa). The corresponding air
velocities through the fibres are listed as well.

The liquid phase was tap water. Most ETS components are soluble in water and tap water is

easily available.

The following compounds were chosen for the filter efficiency evaluation.

The experiments were carried out in a test chamber for indoor air research. The concentra-
tlons generated in the test chamber were relatively high compared with those in rooms with

smokers.
