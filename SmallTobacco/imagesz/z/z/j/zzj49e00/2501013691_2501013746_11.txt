5 TEST OF THE HYDROPHOBIC PROPERTIES OF THE MEMBRANES

The membranes should have a hydrophobic nature without hydrophylic parts in order to act

as a membrane stripper. Leaks between a water phase on one side of the membrane and a gas
phase on the other side should not occur.

All modules have been tested with tap water on the outer side of the fibres (shell side) and
air on the inner side of the fibres. On the shell side an overpressure of 0.5 bar has been

applied on the water. No leaks were detected with any module; thus, all modules were suit-
able to act as a membrane stripper.
