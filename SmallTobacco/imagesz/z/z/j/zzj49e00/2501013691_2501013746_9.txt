3.2 Monitoring of the concentrations of the compounds

Formaldehyde was sampled in an absorber in 0.005 M HC! solution and measured colorime-
trically using the pararosaniline method according to NEN 2795,

Nitrogen dioxide was measured with a Environnement AC 30 NO, monitor based on

chemiluminescence.

Ammonia was measured with a NH3 monitor Thermo Electron Corporation model 14T, based
on chemiluminescence.

Acetone was measured with a Bruell & Kjaer monitor, based on thermo-acoustic detection.
All air flows and water flows were measured with flowmeters.

3.3. Membrane stripper tests

A flow chart of the installation is given in Figure 4.

In this flow chart FI means flow indicator and PI pressure indicator.
