The sensory filtration efficiency is calculated according to the following equation:
efficiency = (Ca-Cb).100/ Ca (%)

where: Ca = air quality in inlet air after substraction of the air quality Cr in the
room (decipol)
Cb = air quality in outlet air after substraction of the air quality Cr in the
room (decipol)
Cr = air quality in the room = 3.1 decipol.

The sensory filtration efficiency is therefore:

(13.4 - 3.1) - (8.4 - 3.1)
x 100 = 49 %,
(13.4 - 3.1)
