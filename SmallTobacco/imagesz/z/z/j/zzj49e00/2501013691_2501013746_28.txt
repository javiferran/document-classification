10 SENSORY CONCENTRATION MEASUREMENTS

An other aspect is compounds of ETS, which cannot be detected by existing analytical in-
struments, but which can penetrate through the filter in sensory detectible amounts. This
aspect is important for complaints in buildings where exhaust air is partially recirculated and
could be a cause of the "sick building syndrome". The same is valid for recirculating filter

units in rooms where smokers are present.
10.1 Definitions and methods

There are two methods available to evaluate the sensory air quality: the dilution method and

the decipol method.

Both have been applied in this study.

Dilution method

In the dilution method odour concentrations are determined sensorically [3]. The determi-
nations are performed by diluting an uir sample just so often that half the panel members can
no longer distinguish the diluted odorous air from odourless air. The number of dilutions (the
dilution number) is the numerical value of the odour concentration.

For example, if it is necessary to dilute 2000 times, the odour concentration of the original

sample is 2000 odour units per m? air of 20 °C. wet (0.u./m3).

An olfactometer is used to dilute odour samples and present therm to the panel members. At

TNO use is made of the so-called “sniffing truck" .
