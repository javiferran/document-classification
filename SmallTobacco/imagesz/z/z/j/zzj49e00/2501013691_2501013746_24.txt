Air samples were collected at the inlet and the outlet of the membrane module according to

the following methods.

Formaldehyde was sampled in an absorber in 0.005 M HC1 solution and measured
colorimetrically using the pararosaniline method according to NEN 2795.

Higher aldehydes (and formaldehyde) were sampled in a collector tube containing 2,4-
dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) on a solid support. After collection and reaction with DNPH
the reaction products of DNPH and aldehydes and ketones (hydrazones) were analysed by
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Nitrogen dioxide was sampled in an absorption tube containing triethanolamine on a solid
support. The NO, content was measured colorimetrically according to NIOSH 6700.
Hydrogen cyanide was sampled in an absorber with 0.1 M NaOH solution and analysed
colorimetrically according to NIOSH $250.

Ammonia was sampled in an absorber with a 0.1 M HCl solution and analysed
colorimetrically according to NEN 6472.

Nicotine was sampled with an absorption tube with XAD-2 and analysed by gas chromatog-
raphy and NPD detection according to TNO Report R88/206 [1].

Acetone and hydrocarbons were sampled in charcoal absorption tubes and analysed by gas
chromatography and FID/ECD detection.

Phenol was sampled in absorption tubes with silica gel and analysed by gas chromatography.

Amines were also sampled in absorption tubes with silica gel and analysed by HPLC.

The results of the efficiency measurements are summarized in Table 7.
