9 EXPERIMENTS WITH ETS

The experiments were continued with the selected optimal membrane module Enka
MD020CP2N for ETS in a test room. -

The general conditions were:

Room volume : 60.2 m3

Ventilation air flow ; 72.0 m3/h

Air change rate : 1.2 hel

Membrane module : MD 020 CP 2N

Air speed : 1.5 m/s

Air flow module : 9.3 dm3/min = 560 dm3/h
Water flow module : 1.0 dm3/min = 60 dm3/h

ETS was generated with the smoke generator according to ISO standard 7210. The filtration
efficiency was measured for the following compounds:
- formaldehyde;

- higher aldehydes;

- hydrogen cyanide;

- nitrogen dioxide;

- ammonia;

nicotine:

HL ZELOLOS2

- acetone;

- hydrocarbons;
phenol;

- amines.

The respirable dust concentration (RSP = respirable suspended particulates) in the room was

monitored with a tyndallometer, Hund type Digital uP.
