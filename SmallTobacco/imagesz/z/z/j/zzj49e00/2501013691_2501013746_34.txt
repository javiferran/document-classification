10.3. Discussion

The sensory filtration efficiency has been measured with two different methods, which are
not (yet) directly comparable with each other. The dilution method is mainly in use for the
quantitative measurement of industrial odour emissions to the outdoor environment without
taking into account the perceived quality of the odour. The decipol method has been recently
developed to characterise the perceived indoor air quality in non-industrial areas. Relations
between both methods are still to be investigated. In this project this was done for unfiltered
and filtered air with a high concentration of ETS.

The sensory filtration efficiency measured with the two different methods was in the same
order of magnitude (65 % and 49 %).

The sensory efficiency was lower than for the measured water soluble compounds of ETS.
This indicates that sensorically perceived compounds are (mainly) caused by compounds that
are not or poorly soluble in water. It is unknown which compounds are responsible for this
phenomenon. It is mentioned that the perceived air quality of the filtered air was different

from that of the unfiltered air with ETS.
