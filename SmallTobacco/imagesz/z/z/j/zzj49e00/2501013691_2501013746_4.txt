2 THE MEMBRANE STRIPPER

The membrane stripper is a relatively new development in the field of gas/liquid contactors.
Various applications for the membrane stripper are under development by the department of
Chemcial Engineering of the TNO Institute of Environmental and Energy Technology [7].

A membrane stripper is a porous barrier between a liquid and the gaseous phase (Figure 1).
The polluted air stream flows at one side of a microporous membrane, a liquid absorbant at
the other side. Gaseous pollutants diffuse through the pores and are absorbed by the liquid,
The contact surface area between gas and liquid phase is maintained by the membrane and is
independent of the gas and liquid flow rate. The selectivity of the partition is determined by
the absorbent. Absorption in the liquid phase is determined either by physical partition or by
a chemical reaction.

Specifically by using hollow fibre membrane modules (Figure 2) it is possible to develop a
very efficient gas-liquid contactor. The majority of absorbents used in conventional gas
absorption processes can also be used in membrane strippers.

A membrane stripper possesses a large specific surface area by the use of hollow membrane
modules: up to 10.000 m?/m3 is possible. This means that a membrane stripper can be much
more compact than a conventional stripper, with specific surface areas in the order of

100 m?/m?. ;

The aim of this part of the study is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the membrane
stripper with small scale modules.

The membrane models used are developed for filtration purposes. Only recently TNO has
started the development of a cross flow membrane module specially designed for mass trans-
fer [8] (Figure 3). This module improves mass transfer, gives a lower pressure drop and is

more easy to scale up.
