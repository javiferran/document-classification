The optimal module for further investigation with ETS is the Enka MDO20CP2N module

with 1.8 mm fibres. The air speed should be 1.5 m/s in order to get high filtration efficien-
cies.

As a second choice the Enka LM2P06 module with 0.6 mm fibres is recommended, also with
an air velocity of 1.5 m/s through the fibres.
