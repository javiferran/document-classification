The dynamic sampling method has been applied. The odorous sample is led directly from the
source through Teflon tubing to the odour measuring truck.

Air samples were taken from the inlet air and the outlet air of the membrane module. The
odour concentration has been measured twice for both on the same day. By comparing both

concentrations the filtration efficiency of the module can be calculated.

Decipol_ method

Professor P.O. Fanger from Denmark introduced recently (Indoor Air â€˜87 Conference, Berlin)
new units for air pollution: the source strength in olf and the perceived air quality in decipol
[4]. The decipol represents the air quality perceived by the nose.

The definitions of the olf and the decipol are based on the air quality caused by a standard
person, perceived by humans.

A standard person is defined as an average adult performing a sitting office task in a
thermally pleasant climate and a hygienic standard of 0.7 bath per day.

One olf is equal to odorous perceivable or irritant pollution emitted by a standard person.
One decipol is equal to the perceived air quality in a room with a ventilation of 10 dm*/s
where one person (1 olf) is present. Each source of pollution is expressed in the number of

olfs to achieve the same dissatisfaction as the actual source [4].

The measurements were performed with a trained panel [5,6]. A trained panel comprises a
group of persons who are trained to judge air samples by comparing them with known levels
of perceived air quality as shown in Figure 19. An initial training period of 1-2 hours during
4 days and a 30-min retraining on the day of the measurement has been performed. The
training of 6 persons was pertormed in a space with high air quality.

The used reference gas was 2-propanone (acetone).
