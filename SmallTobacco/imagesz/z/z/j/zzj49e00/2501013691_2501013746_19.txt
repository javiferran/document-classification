The results are visualised in Figures 11 - 16.

In the figures the modules are indicated with numbers.

1 = Celanese G240/11

2 = Celanese G240/25

3 = Enka LM2P06

4 = Enka MDO20FP2N

5 = Enka MD020CP2N

6 = 2 * EnkaMDO20CP2N (2 modules nr. 4 in series)

Required are:

- high filtration efficiency;

- low pressure drop;

- low membrane surface area;

- low module volume.

Filtration efficiency

The general trend is that the filtration efficiency decreases when the air velocity increases.

For formaldehyde the outlet concentration was lower than the detection limit for all modules.

Selection is then not possible.

For ammonia and acetone the filtration efficiencies at the lower air speeds are high; more
than 85%.

 

The efficiency for nitrogen dioxide seems to be influenced by the concentration. In Figure 12

the efficiencies for NO, concentrations of 150 - 200 ppb are given.
