The relation between the perceived air quality (C) in decipol and acetone concentration (P) in

ppm was determined to be:
C = 0.8 + 0.22.P

In this study air samples were taken from the inlet air and the outlet air of the membrane
module and led by Teflon tubing into two decipol meters. The air flow from the Teflon tube
was 9.2 l/min and was diluted in the decipol meter with “clean” air to 60 I/min. The measure-
ments were performed twice for both samples. By comparing the inlet and outlet concentra-

tions, the filtration efficiency can be calculated.
10.2 Results

The results of the measurements of the odour concentrations measured by the dilution method

are presented in Table 9.
