SUMMARY

Six small scale membrane modules have been purchased with different fibre lengths and fibre
diameters. Each module has been tested as a membrane stripper treating air containing four
different chemicals - formaldehyde, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia and acetone - with tap water.
The pressure drop and the filtration efficiency for the four gases has been measured at three
different air flow rates.

From these results the optimal membrane module has been selected. In the evaluation the
filtration efficiency, the pressure drop, the membrane surface area and instrument volume,
required for the filtration of 100 m3 of air/h, are considered.

The experiments were continued with the selected optimal membrane module for ETS in a
test room. The degree of removal was high, at least 95% for water soluble compounds such
as acetone, nicotine, formaldehyde, higher aliphatic aldehydes, benzaldehyde, ammonia and
hydrogen cyanide. The filtration efficiency for NO, was inconsistent and low for aromatic
and aliphatic hydrocarbons.

The sensory filtration efficiency was measured with two different methods, the dilution
method and the decipol method. The efficiencies were in the same order of magnitude, circa
50%. This lower efficiency is caused by non water soluble components.

The results show that a membrane stripper gives with a high filtration efficiency for water-
soluble gases as found in ETS in combination with a low pressure drop and tap water as the
liquid phase. Long term filtration efficiency still has to be demonstrated.

To realise a complete system for all gaseous components in ETS an additional filtration step
is required for the removal of non water soluble components. This propably can be realised
with a membrane combined with an organic absorption liquid.

Further development of this filtration step for these components is recommended.
