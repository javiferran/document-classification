smokers. The federal

issues raised in the Iron Workers suit were the grounds to
move the Engle

trial to federal court. We expect the judge in the Engle
Trial to make a :

decision on whether she will keep this case in the next 3-5
weeks,

THIS WEEK

* On Monday, August 8, Federal district court Judge Ungaro-
Benages is

holding a status meeting in the Engle trial where she will
hear motions to

remand the case back to state court and deal with
logistical items. We

expect her to rule on these issues relatively soon.

* BAT is reporting 2Q00 on Tuesday, August 1 at 8:30a.m.
EST. The

* The judge in the UST Conwood anti-trust lawsuit could
announce his

decision on whether he will reduce, set aside or uphold the
jury's verdict

sometime in the near future. His decision was apparently
due by the middle

of July. If the judge does not set aside the verdict or
grant a new trial,

UST may have to post a bond to appeal the case.
