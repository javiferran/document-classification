LILI. Instrumentation/Equipment
Our x-ray machine malfunctioned on May 10, 1990. We were
unable to perform energy calibration. After talking with
Tracor personnel on the phone, they shipped us a power supply
board and an options board. Our maintenance personnel replaced
the power supply board and a Tracor service representative
stepped us through the process of adjusting the pots on the
options board. We were then able to. adjust the gain and zero
to bring the instrument back on line.
The cutter drum was removed on May 24, 1990 and taken to Jewett
Machine. They placed the drum on their coordinate measuring
machine and will provide us with a scaled drawing of it.
Hopefully this drawing will give us some insight into why we vw
have had so much difficulty obtaining the desired cuts per os
inch. or
