Dear Bob:

Enclosed is an advanced copy of the Washington State retail package
produced by The Tobacco Institute to help retailers comply with
state law prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors. Full
quantities are due off the press tomorrow, February 12, and can he
ordered, free of charge, by your various members by filling out the
enclosed order forms. You will note you can even receive extra
order forms if necessary to supply your entire membership.

I understand you need some signs for immediate use, so I have
enclosed the remainder of the green signs we prepared for just such
requests during the interim while the full packets were being
produced. Future packets will comprise the finished materials.

Thanks for your interest in participating in this important

program. Please feel free to call me at the number listed above if
you have any questions about the materials or the ordering process.

Sincerely,

“Uh
