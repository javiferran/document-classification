Introduction

 

Under the designation "Biovitro", tests were carried out in which tobacco smoke whe

. .

and tobacco smoke fractions or individual smoke components were reacted with biochemically

“active materials (for example, ferments, protein).

oe In the year 1938, Rondoni (1) formulated the hypothesis that protern denaturization |
and carcinogenisis are interdependent processés. In the following years, different —
‘researchers held the # view that carcinogenisis included small strictural changes or
“drastic denaturization of biologically active maeromolemles. (2,3,4,5,6). That

‘tannic acid, phenol and thiourea denaturize protein has long been known, (7). In in-

‘dependent tests it was later shown that these substances lead to liver and skin tumors |

‘Argus et al. (9) recently reported on this theme. As model substances, they used

ia

“albumin, - whose reaction with water soluble carcinogens - Like nifrosamines -—
was studied. |

‘This publication (6) was the starting point for our own studies. Since the methods
used by the authors“Ttuthidometry, viscosimetry, and measurement of optical activity)
seemed too insensitive, we used p-chlormercuribenzoates which react specifically with
the - SH - groups. This reaction can be followed by UV spectrometry (10).

The 3 or 4 - SH - groups react slowly, probably due to steric hindence (11).

If the solution of albumin is nixed with smoke, the reaction is hastened. It is.
