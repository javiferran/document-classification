clearly a matter of catalytic affect, since the resulting reaction rate within known

limits is independent of the amount of added smoke. .To determine the reaction rate, the |

. Phosphate - buffer (Sorensen) 0.066 M pH = 7.0

Egg Albumin solution: Purest’ egg albumin (recrystallized 5 times) was

obtained from the Serva Cco., Heidelberg. | .

106 mg egg albumin/50 ml phosphate - buffer. (fhe solution could not be older

than 72 hours.)

8.2 mg p-chlormercurif¢benzoate/50 ml phosphate buffer. (The solution should be

filtered before use d over a sintered glass filter.)

Water: Only bidistilled water was used. .

3.3. Procedure

HLZECOSS

“15 ml smoke from the 5th puff of a cigarette were passed into 3 ml egg albumin

solution. Quantitative absorption is not necessary.

 

Immediately after the smoke, 5 ml p-chlormercuribenzoate was added. Simultaneously,
3 ml untreated egg albumin solution was treated with 5 ml - p-chlormercurifbenzoate.

The smoke containing reaction mixture was read on the spectrophotometer at 250 my
against the standard solution at intervals of 1 minute, and the extinction increase .
