Dear Dr Hickey,

Thank you for your letter and your publications on hormesis - it really

does seem to be a topic that raises quite a bit of interest. Your question
about caffeine or nicotene is interesting to me because both seem to stimulate
physiological processes at low levels. I did begin one draft of my review
with the assertion that most people are familiar with the hormetic effects

of caffeine, nicotene and ethanol, but somehow it seemed a little trite!

I felt that to remain credible I ought to keep the examples I gave close to
my own field of interest, so the review and my other papers on hormesis deal
only with growth. I have not yet found examples in the literature of growth
hormesis with caffeine or nicotene.

In recent months we have been trying to see whether the explanations for
growth hormesis in hydroids (reprint enclosed} applies to other organisms.

I have suggested that hormesis is due to regulatory over-corrections of a
rate~sensitive feedback mechanism that controls growth in hydroids. We have
been seeking evidence for a similar explanation in a marine input and have
shown that it oscillates in the same suggestive way, but in the experiments
thus far the extent.cf the growth stimulation is not statistically significant.

Please keep me informed of your own progress with hormesis.
With best wishes.

Yours sincerely,

Welling
