Subject: . Milprint Tipping for Marlboro Lights
Six master rolls of Marlboro Lights tipping from Milprint have been run
to date on the mechanical perforators at 20th Street. This tipping is printed
on Schweitzer's GSR-110 basesheet.
The master rolls fave run well on the perforators and slitters. The gold

contral line seems to be working satisfactorily on the Fife guide sensors.
It has not been necessary to make slitting knife adjustments to keep the print

in registration on the slitter.

There are areas where some improvement can be: made to the Milprint master
rolls:

1. Each master roll should have a unique identification number.

2. The rolls should be stacked with cores vertical, rather than
cores horizontal, on the pailliets.

3. The trim from each edge of the master roll broke several times
during slitting, especially the trim from the edge without the
guideline. Increasing that trim width to 20mm should help
prevent the breakage and subsequent entanglement.
