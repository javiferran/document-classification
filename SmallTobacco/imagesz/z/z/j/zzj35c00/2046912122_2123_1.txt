I want this to be a continuing dialogue among all members of the
Worldwide Corporate Affairs Network, and I encourage everyone to
strive toward that goal. We will continue to work to implement state
of the art compatible communications systems across all Operating
Companies. But in the meantime, remember that all of us can be
reached through either PROFS, MS Mail or both. For those on both
PROFS and MS Mail, we all must learn to check both systems to
facilitate easy communications with our colleagues around the globe.
We will continue to send important announcements out via WCAN.

Teamwork and the sharing of ideas and one's eagerness to learn are
critical to our success. Together, let's strive to help one another
succeed . . . for in that success we can ensure our support of the
business objectives of the company and our over-arching goal - to
increase shareholder value.

I am very proud to be leading such a dedicated and talented group of
Corporate Affairs professionals and I look forward to working with
each of you as we begin to face the many challenges ahead.
