RETAIL TRADE OFFER

The "Retail Trade Offer" is an incentive plan designed to
encourage retailers to purchase KOOL and to achieve the objectives
of the KMDP Program.

If authorized by your Area Sales Director, the Retail Trade Offer
should be presented to all competing retailers within your KMDP
Assignment on a fair and equitable basis.

The Retail Trade Offer is not intended to encourage retailers to
purchase KOOL product solely for the trade offer incentive or to
create situations in which KMDP Sales Representatives perform the
wholesale distributor function for participating accounts.
Instead, this offer should be used to help achieve the following
objectives:

Eliminate out-of-stocks on strategic KOOL brand styles.
Fill distribution gaps on strategic KOOL brand styles.
Gain/maintain additional space on carton and package fixtures.

Gain/maintain additional placements of temporary and permanent
P.O.P. materials.

Since the KMDP Retail Trade Offer is locally-directed, your
Manager will communicate your specific Retail Trade Offer payment
designed to meet the challenges of your marketplace. .

During 1992, the following guidelines should be used when making
Retail Trade Offer payments to KMDP retailers:

The same offer must be made to all competing retailers within
a promotional period.

B&W Drafts should be written for all Retail Trade Offer

payments, using code #123 (please refer to the Reporting
section).
