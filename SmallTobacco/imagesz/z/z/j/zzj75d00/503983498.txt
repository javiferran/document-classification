MORE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES REPORT
Week of 2/25/85

The Brand attended focus groups in Orlando in order to obtain
general consumer information which will be used for this
year's positioning and target evaluation process and also for
1986 planning. Groups were conducted among female franchise
and target 120's and Lights smokers, and male franchise 120's
smokers. Focus group results will be forwarded week of 3/4
with Brand's perspective.

The Brand attended the Second Annual MORE Fashion Award
auditions at Carnegie Hall in New York. The MORE Fashion
Award was established to discover and recognize new fashion
talent in America.

Judges Giorgio Sant'Angelo, Willi Smith and Michaele
Vollbracht selected five finalists from a field of twenty-
four semi-finalists. The five finalists will each present
ten designs from their Fall 1985 collections to leading
fashion retailers and journalists on 4/29 at the Pierre Hotel
in New York. Judges from the final round of competition will
include Mary McFadden and Carolina Herrera, in addition to
the three designers named above. Hostess for the event will
be French film star Catherine Deneuve. The 1985 winner will
receive the MORE Fashion Award which was designed by Paloma
Picasso.

Preliminary indications are that the press is providing good
post-event coverage of the auditions. Articles have already ©
appeared in U.S.A. Today, the Daily News, and the New York
Times, with additional coverage expected soon. The Brand
will forward copies of all articles to me.
