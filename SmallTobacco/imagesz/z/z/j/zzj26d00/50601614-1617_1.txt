based on cell type (spindle vs mixed
cell type}, size (less than 13.5 mm vs
{3.5 mm or greater), and lympho-
cytic infiltration (Jess than 100 per
20 HPF vs 100 per 20 HPF or
greater). Cell type provided the best
discrimination and lymphocytic in-
filtration the worst.

Results

Of the 1078 cases in which the tumors were studied
histologically, 134 tumors contained 100 or more lym-
phocytes per 20 HPF (prevalence, 12.4%). Nine cases were
deleted because of lack of follow-up data resulting in 125
cases in the high lymphocytic group. One hundred twenty-
five cases of tumors with low lymphocytic infiltration were
the control group.

Lymphocytic infiltration was the fourth most significant
risk factor in the univariate Cox model analysis (Table
1). Greater lymphocytic infiltration was associated with
diminished survival rate. Cell type and tumor size were
the most significant factors. Mitotic activity and orbital
invasion were less significant factors than lymphocytic
infiltration. Plasmacytic infiltration was not significantly
associated with the risk of death from metastasis.

We also analyzed the distribution of lymphocytes and
found no difference in survival of patients comparing tu-
mors with diffusc lymphocytic infiltration and perivas-
cular infiltration. To illustrate their relative prognostic
value, survival was calculated using life tables for patients
divided into groups predicted to have good and poor
prognosis based on lymphocytic infiltration, cell type, and
tumor size (Fig. 1).

We analyzed multivariate Cox models to determine if
the association between lymphocytic infiltration and
