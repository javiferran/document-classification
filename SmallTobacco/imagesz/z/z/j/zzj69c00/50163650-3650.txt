Re: Grant #1515
Dear Dr. Ford:

I would like a letter of approval from the Council to purchase a Gibson 8
channel peristaltic pump, #R8, needed to run chromatography colums for
separation of mucins secreted into tissue culture media by airway explants.

As illustrated in the enclosed purchase order, this pump apparently comes
under the heading of equipment, so its purchase would require a transfer of
$921.00 into the " pment" category of the above referenced grant, and
would not require additional funds from the Council.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Kir)
