Marketing Objectives

An in-depth consumer study is currently in the field (results
due mid-December) to confirm and identify problems/opportunities.
Therefore, a detailed plan has been developed for the first
quarter only.

For planning purposes, the Brand is assuming that the revised
advertising and coupon drop to be implemented during the fourth
quarter, 1977, will generate growth momentum. Therefore, during
the first quarter, 1978, the Brand will:

- Spend at a rate designed to generate continued growth (up
to 20%) while providing maximum flexibility in managing the
Brand's total expenditures.

- Appeal to dissatisfied smokers--42% of total market-- fcurrent
full flavor smokers concerned about "tar" (28%) and Hi-Fi
area] dissatisfied with the taste of their current brand
(14%)].

~ Continue to tell consumers that REAL has a superior, rich,
satisfying taste and is low "tar".

- Communicate "all natural" as the Brand's point of difference.

- Utilize "Buy one/get one free" display and targeted sampling/
couponing to gain multi-pack trial/retrial within the context
of this revised message.

It is felt these efforts, in total, will improve REAL's conversion
rate leading to a greater than forecasted volume in 1978.
