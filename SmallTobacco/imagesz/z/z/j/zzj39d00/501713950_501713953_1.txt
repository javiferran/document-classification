Efforts are underway to determine where REAL's weakness lies. Pre-
liminary research indicates that it is on target demographically,

with a current franchise which skews young adult (62%) and male (66%).
Additionally, source of business data is also on the strategic target.
Full Flavor smokers contribute 56% of the brand's business vs. 44%
from Hi-Fi. RJR cannibalization is lower than expected at only 26%.
Major contributors to REAL are Marlboro King (24%), Kool King (14%),

WINSTON King (12%), and Merit (9%).

Consumer data also indicates that the Brand has attained sufficient
awareness (51%), trial (16%), and trier/acceptor (57% of triers
said they would/might buy) rates. However, REAL has a low conversion
rate (9% of trier/acceptors). Current data does not indicate a
product problem. In fact, unidentified product tests indicate that
REAL FILTER is rated significantly better than all existing major
low "tar" brands. The Brand does hypothesize that this conversion
problem is due, at least in part, to the differences seen in the
playback among trier/acceptors concerning product likes and adver-
tising recall. The Brand's advertising communication has not
supported its major product strength (i.e., taste) consistent with
the evolvement of a broadly-based franchise.

Product Likes

(Trier/Acceptors) Ad Recall
Natural 10% 41%
Taste 47% 21%
Low "Tar" 28% 44%

Since this data was received in September, revised ads were developed
and began running in October, followed by a major multipack trial
program ($1.00 off-carton coupon) in November.
