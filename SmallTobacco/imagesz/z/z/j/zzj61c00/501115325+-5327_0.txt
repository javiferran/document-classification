1980 Accountability of: Jack Bellis
Manager: D.W. Tredennick

Object: To improve the Copy Research Process in order to
provide better guidance for copy decisions. Two separate
aspects of this objective are:

1) The establishment of a Standard Communication Test
to serve as the primary research tool in ad/copy
development.

2) To review all existing literature on print
communication principles and ad research prin-
ciples in order to heighten user understanding
of why ad research is conducted as it is.

Establishment of Standard Communications Test

Accomplishments:

1) Design of test technique/methodology, including basic
questionnaire, through consultation with J. Coulson.

2) Experiment with test to identify strengths and weaknesses
and investigate any possible ad format bias (i.e., rough
vs. finished ads, product vs. imagery predominant ads).

3) Documentation of test to establish sensitivity, reliability,
and validity.

Results: A revised Policy and Procedure Manual for Copy Research
which will define the role of the communications test and the
role of the placement recall test in the copy research process
(i.e., developmental vs. evaluative research). The revised
manual will also provide detailed explanation of and docu-
mentation for the two standard tests.

Presentation to Marketing and Brand Research to explain the
communications test, to answer questions, and to encourage use
of the test in ad/copy development.
