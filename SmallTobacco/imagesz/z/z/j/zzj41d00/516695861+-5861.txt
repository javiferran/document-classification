FROM: Mark Reaves MMe

SUBJECT: Honda Motorcycle Giveaway

American Honda has donated a 1995 600ce F3 production bike to RJR for
promotional opportunities. The plan is to paint it similar to the race bike. Honda
is extremely interested in displaying/marketing this bike at other Smokin’ Joe
racing series’. They already impact the motorcycle industry.

Per our conversation, Marty, we could utilize this bike within direct maif pieces
for the Joe’s VIP club members buy notifying them of the sweepstakes.

Additionally, Mike, you said there Is a possibility we could incorporate the bike in
the NASCAR and NHRA MAU's. It would be a great tool to partner all SJR
entities and generate new names with a sweepstakes. These two plans would
greatly satisfy Hondas reasons for donating the bike.

| know this crosses the lines of job responsibilities, Joe’s VIP Club and MAU
activities, however, we have an opportunity.

Currently the agency is developing the new SJR graphics on the reshaped
bodywork of the 600cc F3. | will advise both of you on the status.
