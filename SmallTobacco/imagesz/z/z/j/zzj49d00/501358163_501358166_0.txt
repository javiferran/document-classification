RE: M2 CREATIVE FOCUS GROUPS

The following summarizes the findings from the M2 Creative
Focus Groups conducted in Dallas on August 25-28. A more
comprehensive report of findings is expected from the group
moderator the week of September 15th.

BACKGROUND

Research efforts to date have indicated that Virginia Slims
smokers are perceived to be most like the desired perceptions

of the M2 target (independent, self-confident, action-oriented).
The major deficit associated with Virginia Slims smokers is

the perception of not being warm/friendly. This deficiency
results in a number of M2 target women perceiving Virginia Slims
smokers. to be "pushy, plastic, uncaring".

Initial creative efforts for M2 included a range of alternative
executions from "product-as-hero" to total imagery approaches.  .
However, it was not known whether these executions projected

the independence, self-confidence, active orientation desired

by the target, while retaining the elements of warmth/friendli-

ness.

OBJECTIVES

In order to be retained for further consideration as an M2
executional approach, test executions were to project the

following:
1. Women shown in the ads must be perceived as independent,

self-confident, action-oriented individuals who are also
warm and friendly.

2. Executions must maintain some tie to the SALEM "High
Country" ads, but be seen as different enough to communi-

cate that M2 is a new bran√©.
GROUP COMPOSITION

Six group sessions were conducted among female smokers of 100mm
menthol brands. Two groups were comprised of Virginia Slims
