Dear Dx. DiMarco:

Enclosed please find a copy of the report, "A Global
Perspective on Longer-Term Inhalation Studies of Tobacco Smoke in
Mammals", which was prepared by Kolbye Associates, with the

assistance of Compudex, Inc., pursuant to the current contract
e between your company and mine. ,

Our report to you and your associates was organized on a
geographic basis to provide further insight into the research
pregrams at various centers. Scientific publications from the
open literature dealing with chronic inhalation exposures to
cigarette smoke are reviewed and reported in bolded script.

We have not provided an overview, since to do so implies an
interpretation or value judgement concerning the data.

Thank you for consulting with Kolbye Associates!

Sincerely, ln /

Albert C. Kolbyef jJr., M.D.,M.P.H.,J.D.
Director, Kolby
