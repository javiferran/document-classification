Requested by: Daniel B Kurtz Request Date: 11/08/90
SED Proj Leader: Daniel Kurtz
Prod Location: SEE DESCRIP Make Date: 11/01/90

Results Needed: 12/20/90

Test Objective:

To determine if there are differences in how visitors perceive machine
generated ETS from eight different products (a conventional product,
six XA prototypes, and one QC prototype).

The results from this test will provide the XA project with product development
direction.
