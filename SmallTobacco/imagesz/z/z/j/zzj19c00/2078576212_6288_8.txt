5 Experimental Design and Procedures
5.1 Media and Reagent Preparation

All media and reagents were prepared using ultrapurified water. All equipment, glassware, and
media used were sterile. The chemicals were obtained from GIBCO, Biochrom, Merck,
Boehringer, or Sigma at a purity of between 96 and 100 %. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was
obtained from ICN.

For cell cultivation, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), containing 10% FBS,
penicillin G (1- 10° U/l), and streptomycin sulfate (100 mg/l) was used. It was stored at
approximately 4 °C until use, the maximum storage period being 6 weeks.

5.2. Test System and Procedures

The principle of the NRU assay is the uptake of neutral red, a vital dye, into the
lysosomes/endosomes of viable cells thereby enabling their quantification (Borenfreund and
Puerner, 1985). The NRU assay was performed in basic conformity with INVITTOX protocol
(1990) with mouse embryo BALB/c 3T3 cells, clone A31 obtained at passage no. 67 from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CCL 163). These cells were subcultivated and

aliquots were stored in liquid nitrogen vapor until use.
The NRU assay was performed 3 times on separate study days (3 substudies). In each

substudy, 4 replicate 96-well microtiter plates per smoke fraction were used, 8 concentrations

per smoke fraction, each concentration replicated 6 times per microtiter plate.
