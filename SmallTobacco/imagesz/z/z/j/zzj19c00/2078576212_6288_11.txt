The TPM, DPM, tar, and nicotine yields for the YMF114 smoked in the different groups of
lighters were between 67 and 84 % lower than those for the 1R4F (Table 7, Figure 2). Within
the lighter groups, the TPM, DPM, and tar yields for the YMF114 decreased by approximately
25 % from the highest values for lighter group E-0 to the lowest values for E-480; for nicotine by
approximately 17 %.

The amount of acrolein determined in the GVP fraction of the YMF114 smoked in different
lighter groups was between 10 and 20 % that of the 1R4F (Table 8). Analytical data, however,
revealed the acrolein yield for the YMF114 to be approximately 30 % that of the 1R4F
(INBIFO study P 0500/3286). This discrepancy may be explained by the smoke volume-
dependent trapping efficiency for acrolein in the GVP fraction, i.e., for the YMF114, 7.2 puffs/ml
yielded approximately 45 %, and for the 1R4F, 2.2 puffs/ml yielded approximately 75 % of the
total amount of acrolein that passed through the trap. A higher number of puffs was required for
the YMF114 in order to obtain a cytotoxic response for TPM in the NRU assay. Since acrolein is
assumed to contribute substantially to the cytotoxicity of the GVP fraction, the cytotoxicity of the
GVP fractions of the cigarette types might not be directly comparable, unless the mechanism of

this effect, its impact on the cytotoxicity, and its biological implications are investigated.

In the cytotoxicity assay, a dose-related decrease in the number of viable cells was seen for all
smoke fractions (Table 9 to Table 16, Figure 3 to Figure 10). From the EC. values, the
reciprocal ECs, values (1/ECs9} - as a measure of cytotoxicity - were calculated on a per puff,

per mg TPM, per mg tar, and per cigarette basis (Table 17 to Table 20).
On a per puff basis, the cytotoxicity of the TPM fraction of the YMF114 smoked in different

groups of lighters was approximately 60 % lower than that of the GVP fraction; for the 1R4F, it
was approximately 20 % lower (Table 17 to Table 20).
