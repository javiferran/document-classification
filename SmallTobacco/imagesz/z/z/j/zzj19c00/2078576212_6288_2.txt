1 Abstract

In the present study, the in vitro cytotoxicity of mainstream smoke (MS) fractions, i.e., TOTAL
PARTICULATE MATTER (TPM) and the WATER-SOLUBLE FRACTION of the GAS/VAPOR
PHASE (GVP) of the test cigarette YMF114, smoked in different groups of E-series lighters, was
compared with that of the respective fractions of the Reference Cigarette 1R4F. The cytotoxicity
determination was carried out in the neutral red uptake assay with mouse embryo BALB/c 3T3

cells.

Prior to receipt, 0 (E-0)}, 240 (E-240), or 480 (E-480) cigarettes had been smoked on the lighters in
addition to the 20 cigarettes used for performance testing. The lighters were cleaned by electrical
heating after each 20 cigarettes, except for those in group E-0, which were cleaned at INBIFO by

sonication.

The TPM and GVP fractions were collected from the same puffs. TPM was collected on glass fiber
filters and then extracted with dimethyl sulfoxide. The whole gas vapor phase, which passed
through the same filter, was bubbled through phosphate-buffered saline. Exposure was performed
by incubating mouse embryo BALB/c 3T3 cells for 24h in culture medium to which
solutions/suspensions of the smoke fractions of the cigarettes were added. For each cigarette type

and lighter group, 3 batches of each smoke fraction were prepared and assayed.

There was a decreasing trend apparent for the cytotoxicity of both smoke fractions of the YMF114

from lighter group E-0 to lighter group E-480.

On a per puff and on a per cigarette basis, the cytotoxicity of the test cigarette YMF114 smoked in
different lighter groups was between 64 and 90 % lower than that of the Reference Cigarette
1R4F.

On a per mg TPM basis, the cytotoxicity of the TPM fraction of the YMF114 smoked in the 3 lighter
groups was between 50 and 60 % lower than the cytotoxicity of the TPM fraction of the 1R4F; for
the GVP fraction, it was virtually identical when smoked in the E-0 lighter group and approximately
20 % lower when smoked in the lighter groups E-240 and E-480.

On a per mg tar basis, the cytotoxicity of the TPM fraction of the test cigarette smoked in all lighter
groups was between 27 and 39 % lower than that of the 1R4F; for the GVP fraction, it was
between 22 and 42 % higher.
