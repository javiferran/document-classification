2 Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the in vitro cytotoxicity of mainstream smoke (MS)
fractions of the test cigarette YMF114, smoked in different groups of E-series lighters, with that
of the Reference Cigarette 1R4F.

3 General Design

The cytotoxicity determination was carried out in the neutral red uptake (NRU) assay with
mouse embryo BALB/c 3T3 cells using the cigarette smoke fractions TOTAL PARTICULATE
MATTER (TPM) and WATER-SOLUBLE FRACTION of the GAS/VAPOR PHASE (GVP). The
cytotoxicity of the smoke fractions was compared on the basis of their ECs) values. This is the
concentration that reduces the number of viable cells by 50 % compared to the corresponding

solvent control. The assay was performed 3 times on separate study days.

The study was conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) principles

(Grundsatze der Guten Laborpraxis, 1994).
