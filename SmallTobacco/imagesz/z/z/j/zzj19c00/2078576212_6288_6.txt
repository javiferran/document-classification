After each 20 + 2 cigarettes, heater cartridges of the lighters were cleaned either by sonication
or by electrical heating. The lighters were operated in a 2-phase pulse density-modulated
heating mode with 3 subphases of phase 1 (Table 3). The resistance to draw of each lighter
and heater cartridge assembly was between 80 and 130 mm column of water. The Reference
Cigarette 1R4F was smoked on a conventional 30-port INBIFO smoking machine, type SM85,

connected to an in-house vacuum system for puffing.

The TPM and GVP fractions were collected from the same puffs. The TPM from 80 puffs of the
1R4F and from 360 puffs (E-0) and 480 puffs (E-240, E-480} of the YMF114 was collected on
individual glass fiber filters (47 mm diameter) and then extracted with 8 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). The whole gas vapor phase, which passed through the same filter, was bubbled
through 36 ml (1R4F) or 50 ml (YMF114) of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a gas wash

bottle. Approximately 1h after preparation, the smoke fractions were added to the cell cultures.

For each TPM fraction, the yields of TPM, nicotine, and water were determined. The yields of
dry particulate matter (DPM) and of tar were calculated. For each GVP fraction, the trapped
amount of acrolein was determined. In addition, the number of puffs and the puff count were

determined.
