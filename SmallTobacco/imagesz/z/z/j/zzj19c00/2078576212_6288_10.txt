6 Statistics and Evaluations

For the analytical data, the number of values, the arithmetic mean, and measure of variance

were given as descriptive statistics.

In the NRU assay, for each smoke fraction per individual batch as well as for acrolein, the

following evaluations were performed:

- calculation of mean background-corrected absorbance values at each test substance
concentration relative to the mean background-corrected value of the corresponding
solvent control as well as calculation of the standard error (SE);

- calculation of the ECs value by nonlinear least squares fit (regression analysis) to the

S-shaped logistic function on the basis of puffs/ml or mmol/l.
For each smoke fraction, the mean of the reciprocal ECso values obtained from the 3 batches
was calculated and expressed as mil/puff, ml/mg TPM, mli/mg tar, and mi/cig. The mean
reciprocal ECsp values of the smoke fractions of the test cigarette smoked in different lighter

groups were calculated relative to those of the 1R4F smoke fractions.

For acrolein, the mean of the reciprocal ECsÂ» values expressed as |/mmol was calculated.
