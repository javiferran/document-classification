4.2 Preparation, Dosing, and Analyses of Smoke Fractions

Before used for smoke generation, the cigarettes were conditioned for at least 48h at
approximately 22 °C and 60 % relative humidity following ISO standard 3402 (1991).

The MS was generated in basic conformity with ISO standard 3308 (1991), some deviations
(e.g., rectangular puff profile, free smoking; and in addition for test cigarette: fixed
8 puffs/cigarette) being necessary for technical reasons. The YMF114 was smoked on a
modified 30-port INBIFO smoking machine, type LSM85, equipped with 15 battery-operated E2-
series lighters *, and connected to a 4-piston pump (Battelle) for puffing. E2-series lighters were
equipped with either E1-series or E2-series heater cartridges *. Lighters and heater cartridges
were identified by individual serial numbers, and lighter/heater cartridge combinations were
specified by the supplier according to “E2” E.P.LE. listings. MS of the YMF114 was generated
with 3 groups of lighters ” that differed in the number of cigarettes smoked and the cleaning

protocol used (Table 2).

Major specifications of the equipment are documented in the lighter system product specifications
E1-series, revision 6.3, 3 Feb.1998. Documentation of any differences with regard to E2-series
lighters used in conjunction with E1- or E2-series heater cartridges is the sole responsibility of the
supplier.

Lighters had already been used in INBIFO study P 0500/3286.
