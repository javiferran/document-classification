There was a decreasing trend apparent for the cytotoxicity of both smoke fractions of the
YMF 114 (between 4 and 38 %) fram lighter group E-0 to lighter group E-480 (Table 21 to Table

24). This trend was seen for each calculation basis.

On a per puff and on a per cigarette basis, the cytotoxicity of the YMF114 smoked in different
groups of lighters was between 64 and 90% lower for both smoke fractions than the
cytotoxicity of the 1R4F (Table 21 and Table 24, Figure 11 and Figure 14).

On a per mg TPM basis, the cytotoxicity of the TPM fraction of the YMF114 smoked in the
3 lighter groups was between 50 and 60 % lower than the cytotoxicity of the TPM fraction of the
1R4F; for the GVP fraction, it was virtually identical when smoked in the E-O lighter group and
approximately 20 % lower when smoked in the lighter groups E-240 and E-480 (Table 22,
Figure 12).

On a per mg tar basis, the cytotoxicity of the TPM fraction of the test cigarette smoked in all

lighter groups was between 27 and 39 % lower than that of the 1R4F; for the GVP fraction, it
was between 22 and 42 % higher (Table 23 and Figure 13).
