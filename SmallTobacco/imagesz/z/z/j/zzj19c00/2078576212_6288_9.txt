In each well, 1.0 - 10* cells were seeded and cultivated in culture medium containing 10 % FBS.
Approximately 24h after seeding, the cells were exposed for 24h to the smoke fractions
dissolved/suspended in culture medium containing 4.8 % FBS. At the end of exposure, the
culture medium containing the smoke fractions was replaced with culture medium containing
neutral red. Following a 3-h incubation period, the optical density of neutral red as a measure

for the number of viable cells was determined photometrically at 540 nm.

5.3. Test System Characterization and Criteria for Test Validity

The morphology of the cells was checked routinely with a microscope and showed no signs of
abnormalities. In addition, cells were screened for mycoplasma and there was no indication of

infection.
The population doubling times of the cell cultures were in the required range of 24 + 5h.

The sensitivity and reproducibility of the NRU assay was checked by determining the
responsiveness of the cells to the positive control substance acrolein in the cytotoxicity assay
(Table 4 to Table 5 and Figure 1). The cytotoxicity of acrolein as well as that of the smoke
fractions of the 1R4F was in accordance with results obtained in previous INBIFO studies
(Table 6).
