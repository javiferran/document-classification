Figure 1, Recombinant CAT Plasmids Used in This Study

(A} Diagrammatic representation of relevant portions of pIVACAT1. The various domains are labeled and are, from left to right: a truncated T7 promoter
(Parvin et al., 1989), the 5° nontranslated end of influenza A/PR/&34 virus segment 8 (22 nt), 8 nt of linker sequence, the entire CAT gene coding
region (660 nt), the entire 3’ nontranslated end of influenza A/PR/8/94 virus segment 8 (26 nt), and linker sequence containing the Hgal restriction
enzyme site. Relevant restriction enzyme sites and start and stop sites for the CAT gene are indicated.

{B) The 716 base RNA products obtained following Hgat digestion and transcription by T7 RNA polymerase of plVACAT1 and pIVACAT2. Influenza
viral sequences are indicated by bold letters, CAT gene sequences by plain letters, and linker sequences by italics. The triplets—in antisense
orientation—representing the initiation and termination codons of the CAT gene are indicated by arrow and underline, respectively. IVACAT2 ANA

differs from IVACAT1 AINA by 3 nt at the 5’ end (outlined).

The IVACAT1 RNA Is Transcribed In Vitro

by the Influenza A Virus RNA Polymerase

Recently it was demonstrated in our laboratory that syn-
thetic RNAs containing at the 3’ end the 15 3° terminal
nucleotides of influenza virus RNA segment 8 can be tran-

ree -890- .

Influenza Virus Polymerase Transcription

Lanes 1-4: polyacrylamide gel analysis of radiolabeled T7 polymerase
transcripts from pIVACAT1 and pHgaNS. Lanes 6 and 6: polyacryl-
amide gel analysis of the radiolabeled products of in vitro transcription
by purified influenza A polymerase protein using unlabeled IVACAT1
ANA and HgaNS RNA templates.

IVACAT1 RNA. Lane 5: viral polymerase transcript of IVACAT1 RNA,
Lane 6: viral polymerase transcript of HgaNS RANA.

scribed in vitro using purified influenza A virus RNA poly-
merases (Parvin et al., 1989). We tested whether unla-
beled IVACAT1 RNA could be transcribed in a similar way.
Lane 5 in Figure 2 shows that the in vitro transcription
reaction generated an RNA of discrete length and simitar
size to the product of the T7 transcription reaction, sug-
gesting synthesis of a full-length product.

RNP Transfection and CAT Activity

Since the recombinant CAT RNA could be transcribed in
vitro, a system was designed to test whether this RNA can
be recognized and replicated in vivo (Figure 3). Recom-
binant RNA was mixed with the purified polymerase to al-
low formation of viral RNP-like particles. Initially, in order
to facilitate the association, the RNA-polymerase mixture
was incubated in transcription buffer without nucleotides
for 30 min at 30°C prior to RNP transfection. In tater ex-
periments this preincubation step was omitted. RNP trans-
fections were either preceded or followed by infection with
influenza AAWSN/33 virus, since the production of viral
polymerase protein was expected to be necessary for effi-
cient amplification of the gene. The cells used were either
MDBK or MDCK cells, which are readily susceptible to in-
fluenza AMWSN/33 virus infection, or human 293 cells,
which support infection at a slower rate.
