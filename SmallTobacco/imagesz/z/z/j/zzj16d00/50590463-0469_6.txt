(pH 7.5). The samples were subsequently freaze-thawed three times
and the cell debris was pelleted. The supernatant was used for CAT
assays,

Pagsaglng of Virus from RNP-Transfected Calls

MDCK cells were infected with helper virus and RNP-transfected 1.5
hr later as described above. After 14 hr cells and medium were col-
lected and cells were spun down. One hundred microliters of the su-
Pernatant medium, containing virus, was added three times to 35 mm
dishes with MDCK cells; each time the inoculum was removed after
20 min, and finally MEM containing 1 pg/ml trypsin was added. At
diffarent times these cells were collected and assayed for CAT activity.
Similarly, MDBK cells were infected, RNP-transfected celis and medi-
um were harvested after 19.5 hr, and the medium was used for infection
of new MDBK cells that were subsequently maintained in REM con-
taining 1 yg/ml trypsin. This serial passaging was repeated twice and
cells and medium were in each case harvested 16 hr p.i.

CAT Assays

CAT assays were done according to standard procedures, adapted
from Gorman et al. (1982). The assays contained 10 yl of [4C]chlor-
amphenicol (05 wCi; 83 nM; NEN), 20 ul of 40 mM acetyl-CoA
(Boehringer), and 50 ul of cell extracts in 0.25 M Tris buffer (pH 75).
Incubation times were 16-18 hr.
