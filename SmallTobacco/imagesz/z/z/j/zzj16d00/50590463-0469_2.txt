ments

To determine whether the minus-sense IVACAT1 RNA
could be amplified and transcribed in vivo, 293 cells were
transfected with RNP, infected with virus 1 hr later, and
harvested at various times postinfection (p.i.). Figure 44
shows that at early times after infection only background
levels of CAT activity were detected (lanes 5, 7, and 9).
However, significant levels of CAT activity appeared 8.5 hr
p.i. (Figure 4A, lane 11). A similar level of CAT activity was
detected 2 hr later (Figure 4A, lane 13). There were back-
ground levels of CAT activity in the mock-transfected cells
at any time point (lanes 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14) and in control
cells not infected with AAWSN/33 virus (lanes 1~4).

It was then tested whether preincubation of RNA and
polymerase complex was necessary for successful RNP
transfection. As can be seen in Figure 48, lanes 2 and 3,
preincubation might actually cause a decrease in CAT ac-
tivity, presumably due to RNA degradation during prein-
cubation. In another control experiment, infection by helper
virus of RNP-transfected cells was omitted (Figure 4B,
lanes 4 and 5). These helper virus proteins may include
the nonstructurat NS1 and NS2 proteins and/or different
forms of the polymerase complex necessary at different
times during the course of infection. Since these lanes
show no CAT activity, we conciude that the IVACAT1 RNA
is amplified specifically by the protein machinery supplied
by the helper virus. In an additional control experiment,
naked RNA was transfected into cells that were subse-
quently helper-infected or mock-infected. Again, no CAT
activity was detected in these samples (Figure 46, lanes
6-9). Finally, virus-infected cells that had not been trans-

Figure 4. CAT Assays of Cells RNP‘Transfected with IVACAT1 RNA
(A) Time course of RNP transfection in 293 cells. Cells were trans-
fected at —1 hr with the recombinant ANP and infected with virus at
time 0. Calls were harvested at the indicated time points and assayed
for CAT activity,

(B) Raquiremenis for RNP transfection of 293 cells. Parameters of the
reaction mixtures were as indicated.

(C) Transfection of MDCK cells with !VACAT1 RNA polymerase al sither
—1 hror +2 hr relative to virus infection. Cells were harvested and CAT
activity assayed at the indicated times. Components/conditions of the
reaction were as indicated.

“Time” indicates the time paint of harvesting the cells. Helper virus
was added at time 0. “RNA’ represents the IVACAT1 RNA. “Pol” is the
purified influenza A/PR/8/34 polymerase protein complex. “WSN” indi-
cates the influenza AAWSN/33 helper virus. “Pre-inc” indicates prein-
cubation of RNA and polymerase in transcription buffer at 30°C for 30
min. “Trans. time” indicates the time of RNP transfection relative to vi-
rus infection. Plus and minus signs indicate the presence or absence
of the particular componentiteature. Lanes C: control assays using
commercially available CAT enzyme (Boehringer Mannheim).
