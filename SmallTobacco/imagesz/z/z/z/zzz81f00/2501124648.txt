Nitrate electrode (1)

An Orion nitrate electrode is currently under test. The
company claims that one can measure continuously the nitrate
content in liquids.

Acid consumption (2) ©

Trials of the pilot plant showed different results concerning

the acid consumption in the NINO-process than those we have

found in the laboratory. We therefore determine these values
again at different pH-values and initial phosphate concentrations.
We could confirm the consumption of 31 g phosphoric acid (35 %)
per liter of denitrated extract ata PH of 4.0. This value is
independent of the dilution rate.

Having still some troubles with our CO9/05 determination in the
off-gas of fermenters we set up a continuous denitration using

a synthetic culture medium. In this trial we could show that we
need at least 3 days to reach true steady-state conditions.

It however has to be mentioned that the denitration is also ®
working without having a true steady-state. We try now to have
analogous trials done in the laboratory and pilot plant fermenters

Cellulase (4)

 

The production of cellulase by Trichoderma viride DSM 769 was
further tested. An addition of glucose at a maximal level of
'0.2 % increases the yield of this enzyme. The same is true
by using Tween 80 in a concentration between 0.1 and 0.5 3%.

Freeze-dryer

The freeze-dryer has been received and tested. We are able to
produce freeze-dryed Ninomass and can now cover the needs of
the Richmond flavor department.
