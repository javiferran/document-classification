Acceptable Daily Intake of Dicamba

A safe level or acceptable daily intake (ADI) of Dicamba has
been calculated by RJRT as follows:

1. An average person weighs 60 kg (conservative).

2. This person consumed 60 cigarettes per day (99.4% of the
U.S. population consumes 60 or less cigarettes/day) .-

3. The No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) in a one-year dog
study is 1.25 mg/kg.

4. The NOEL (1.25 mg/kg) is used to calculate an ADI for
humans.

e 1.25 mg/kg + 100 fold safety factor = 0.0125 mg/kg
e 60 kg person x 0.0125 mg/kg = 0.75 mg/day

se 0.75 mg/day + 60 cigarettes per day = 0.0125
mg/cigarette

e 0.0125 mg/cig + 0.89 grams tobacco/cigarette = 0.0140
mg/gram

e 0.0140 mg Dicamba/gram tobacco = 14 ppm as the ADI
for Dicamba

Hence, 14 ppm is an acceptable daily intake of Dicamba whether
consumed orally or by inhalation. Even with this conservative
estimate, this value is 28 times higher than the 0.5 ppm
residue level for Dicamba on tobacco set by the USDA.

In the case of smoke, our studies show less than 5% of the
Dicamba present in the cigarette is transferred into the
mainstream smoke or to the environment. Therefore, if tobacco
were the sole source of Dicamba, the leaf that is used to make
cigarettes could contain up to 280 ppm Dicamba and still be
within the acceptable daily intake level for Dicamba

(280 x 5% = 14 ppm).
