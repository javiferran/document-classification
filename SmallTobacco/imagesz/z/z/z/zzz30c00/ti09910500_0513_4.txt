fungi involved in allergic respiratory diseases with 85% of patients found to
be allergic to one or more members of these fungal genera. The bacterial
species which have been isolated from surface and air samples in the indoor
environment and which can cause infections in people include members of the
staphylococcus, pseudomonas and flavobacterium groups.

Ventilation

Good ventilation for commercial office buildings is defined by ASHRAE,
who in their recently published Standard 62-1989, “Ventilation for Acceptable
Indoor Air Quality," 3 call for either a minimum intake of 20 cubic feet per
minute of outside air per person at all times of building occupancy, or,
evidence by measurements that no indoor air pollutants are accumulating in the
building air in unacceptable amounts,

An analysis of HBI Indoor Air Quality Investigations over the period from
1981 to 1988 ,* given in Table II, shows that where the ventilation status of a
