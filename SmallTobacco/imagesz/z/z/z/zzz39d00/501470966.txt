Dear Dr. Lynn:

A number of us here at Reynolds have piven a
great deal of consideration to the proposal outlined
by you in your letter of November 7, 1978, to Dr.
Murry Senkus. As we indicated when you visited with
us in Winston-Salem, we feel your proposal is both
interesting and provocative. We have also shared it
with a few individuals outside the Company with whom
we consult regarding requests made to the Company for
research funds. We would like for one of them, Mr.
William S. Shinn of Kansas City, Missouri, to meet
with you and discuss your proposal more fully. Mr.
Shinn is an attorney and is one of the people the
tobacco industry uses as liaison for research projects
presently ongoing, some of which may involve work
similar to that suggested in your proposal. Mr. Shinn
and I would like to come to Durham on March 16. Please
advise if that date is convenient to you.

Very truly yours
Signed - Max H. Crohn, Jr.
