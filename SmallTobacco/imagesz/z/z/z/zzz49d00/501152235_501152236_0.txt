Dear Rays

t
The R. J. Reynolds corporate schedule in Redbook Megazine is now the
equivalent of 23 national pages vhich cualifies all advertising for the
18 to 25 page discount. This discount is 17; for advertising placed in
issues January through June and 19% for advertising scheduled from July
through the end of this year.

It would be to the advantage of Reynolds to consider scheduling at least
one more page 4~color insertion at a cost of $19,519 vitich would make all
advertising scheduled for this year eligible for the next discount level,
21, to 30 pages, thus earning a 2535 discount and a rebate of $44,461 re.
sulting in a savings of $24,942.

: To take advantage of this opportunity Reynolds would have to schedule
the adcitional page insertion in either the November or December issues
since the closing date for October has passed. WINSTCN and VA:TAGE are
both scheduled for the November and December issues thus SALE or DORAL

would have to be allocated for the page insertion. SALEM is presently
scheduled for the Qeceaber Dy sue, wille DORAL is not scheduled for either
issue. ‘
