R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company s Page Two

Actually, should Reynolds be interested, it would be possible to purchase
another national page as well as a regional page insertion in the New York,
Los Angeles and New Orleans/Birmingham/Hemphis editions with the remaine
ing rebate dollars.

We would appreciate knowing of your decision and having your comments
as early as possible.

Very truly yours,
