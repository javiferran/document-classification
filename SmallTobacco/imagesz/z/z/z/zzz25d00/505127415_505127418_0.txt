BRAZIL TRIP REPORT, DECEMBER 8-18, 1985

 

OBJECTIVES:

(1) Accompany Dr. Guy Gooding, NCSU, to Brazil to observe and identify a
virus-like disease of tobacco. (2) Review and observe the operation of the
forced-air curing system installed in selected flue-cured tobacco barns.

(3) Review other field tests and production programs.

SUMMARY:

In November, 1985, a virus-like disease of tobacco was observed that has the
potential of threatening much of the Brazilian crop. Dr. Guy Gooding, NCSU
phytopathologist and virus expert, agreed to conduct an on-site investigation
of the disease. His observations, on-site antigen-antibody reactions, and
subsequent laboratory tests demonstrated conclusively that the disease is
caused by the tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV).

The operation of several experimental forced-air curing systems, designed by
Mr. Mike Bernard, and installed in flue-cured tobacco barns, was observed. In
all cases, tobacco cured in the modified barns, as compared to that of
conventional barns, exhibited a significantly deeper-orange color and a
sweeter aroma.

Most field investigation plots were beginning to suffer from the lack of rain;
however, they will still produce valuable data. Most tests were set to the
field early and are currently being harvested.

STATUS:

This is an ongoing project. Future recommendations and research proposals are
primarily contingent upon the results of the current experiments.
