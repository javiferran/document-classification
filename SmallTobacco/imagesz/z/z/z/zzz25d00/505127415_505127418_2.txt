Other Projects and Observations: Most field investigation plots were
beginning to suffer from the lack of rain. However, they will still produce
valuable data. Most tests were set to the field early and are currently being
harvested.

Most of the seed production plots appeared satisfactory and are safely
beyond the stage where drought could be a severe problem.

The introduction of different varieties into the production program appears
to be producing the desired affects in that the newer varieties are curing
more to the orange side as compared to the lemon color of Coker 319.

Sclerotinia stalk rot continues to be a problem and control measures should
be investigated during the next season. Since infection appears to occur
through tissues damaged from contact sucker control agents, modifications
in application methods or the use of different sucker control agents may be
sufficient. The best control strategy.

The current drought stimulates renewed interest in irrigation. It was
agreed that it would be of value to determine the current cost of
irrigation equipment as applicable to an individual farm, as well as,

equipment of larger capacity that might be used on several neighboring
farms.

Cultivation methods and lack of rain also renews my interest in subsoiling
investigations. These studies wil] be implemented during the next season.

An information update on the soil testing program, procedures, and
recommendations will be provided by Dr. Charles Sopher.
