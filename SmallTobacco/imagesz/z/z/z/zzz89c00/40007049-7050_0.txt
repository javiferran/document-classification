Dear Dr. Eisenberg,

I am writing to seek an invitation to apply for research funding from your agency. Recently, I have been
appointed as an assistant professor in the departments of Pathology and Microbiology & Immunology at the
Stanford University School of Medicine. There, I will begin my independent research career continuing my
biochemical studies on how the cell cycle controls DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. This follows on
work I began in Mare Kirschner's lab originally at the University of California, San Francisco, and now at
Harvard Medical School.

Although my current work is focused on the biochemistry of the ce"! ~ “ 1d replication, my enclosed
curriculum vitae should attest to my long-standing inter-~* * My graduate work with David
Baltimore at MIT focused on the role of ah - zukemia. I see my current
work on the normal physiology ~ ting how the cell cycle is
altered in transformed cells and .

Tenclose a general plan of the st Oe hs that broader set of projects
on DNA replication that I will sti 3 “ \Council to fund is to study

Q N2®T — ‘schanisms by which these

proteins that are stoichiometric in
report in Nature

proteins inhibit specific steps in DB

showing that one such inhibitor, ci \2\ ~ntly target two factors
important for replication: the cycli erg? \ 3 NA. More generally, I
have established the importance of « 5 ublished in The Journal

identified inhibitors, for
t cyclin-dependent

of Cell Biology. We are currently fi
example, the proteins p27KIP! and,
kinases and DNA replication. Our di ‘portant for DNA
replication. The funding of our proje york demonstrating the
existence of the novel target and to tes \ j , «two-hybrid screen is
indeed this target. Depending on the ps . wae to ask about other novel targets for
the growing family of these inhibitors. _ -, zwentifying the minimal domains of these proteins
required for inhibition, we may be able _ ..uu peptides inhibitors which could serve as beginning models
for drug design, with obvious implications for chemotherapy.

 

Yenclose my curriculum vitae and a general plan for the research project, and copies of three papers relevant
to this work. I will be in full time residence at Stanford beginning December 1, 1995. Until that time, I
will be corresponding from Harvard Medical School. I thank you for your consideration and look forward
to hearing from the Council.

Sincerely,

de

Peter K. J on, Ph.D.
