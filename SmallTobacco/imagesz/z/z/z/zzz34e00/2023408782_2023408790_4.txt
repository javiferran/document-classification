derived during smoking. The first: is the addition. of secondary amine hr
alkaloids to filler. The addition of anabasine yielded’ NAB in MS. smoke oe
(Haut, S. A., Notebook 8595, p. 88). The addition of nornicotine and

anatabine yielded NNN and’ NAT, respectively, in MS smoke (Kinser, R. D.

6908 annual report~-smoke condensate studies, Annual Report 87-084, pp. 15-

17; Kinser, R. D. 6908 Annual! Report 85-141, pp. 19-23). The: second type

of evidence is the correlation of NN and AT levels in samples of DBC Burley

filler (that were extracted with varying mixtures. of ethanol and hexane to

provide varying levels of these alkaloids) with the corresponding levels of

NNN and NAT in MS smoke, while levels: of MS NNK from the samples were not

significantly different from. each other or from that of the unextracted

filler (Warfield, A.. H. 69108 Progress Report, November, 1988; Haut, S$. A.
