VII, a protease.'’ A study to determine whether bound NNK and bound! PsON
exist in filler andi fractions obtained thereof i's scheduled. to begin in First
Quarter, 1991. Two general approaches willl be used. In one approach, water-
extracted fillers will be digested with alkali to remove the bound alkaloids,
and the resulting extract. will be analyzed for TSNA. that may be liberated.
In another approach, fillers and fractions thereof will be nitrosated in an
aqueous system containing nitrite ion, and! the increase in TSNA, both bound
and. free, will be measured. This will allow the determination. of the rela-
tive importance of bound precursors as' opposed to bound TSNA, as: well as. that
of free precursors as opposed to free TSNA. Other work on these questions

involves the determination of the effect of. gas-phase nitrogen. oxides on

pyrosynthetic production of NNK from precursors such asi nicotine.” Metho-
dology for testing small quantities of solid materials (such as BW, filler,
ox, fractions: obtained during other research activities) for formation of TSNA
during, combustion/pyrolysis will be developed.

Two types of evidence support the conclusion that MS NNN and MS NAT and
other TSNA derived directly from secondary amines can be pyrosynthetically
