provide TSNA precursors, there is a shortage of nitrosating agent during
curing of Or tobacco, which explains the low production. of preformed TSNA,
and may preclude the nitrosation of bound NNK precursor. The lack of pyro-
synthesis of NNK as well as the other TSNA during smoking of Or cigarettes
could be due to the lack of nitrosating agents during smoking, the lack of
bound precursors or bound NNK, or to the presence of natural inhibitors: of
pyrosynthesis in Or tobacco. Evidence for a natural inhibitor in or CEL has
been reported.’* Further evidence for the presence: of an inhibitor in or
tobacco tends to lend credence to this mechanism.’' However, the low levels
of: MS: NNK from water-extracted Or (e.g.,. OrBW) could be due simply to the low
levels: of nitrosating, agents and bound nicotine during growth. and curiing of
Or tobacco, leading, to low levels of: bound’ NNK and/or bound NNK’ precursors.
