Herb--

we have confirmed our research schedule for assessing the
appropriateness of U.S. materials for Canada. We would be delighted
to have you attend the groups if your schedule allows. We will be
receiving the draft discussion guides tomorrow. Are you interested in
reviewing them?? The groups have been designed to provide us with
major market vs perimeter vs rural perceptions. Guelph is “rural”, and
Mississauga is "perimeter". Toronto (core) tends to be more jaded
than outlying areas, so we do not want to rely solely on Toronto
perceptions in developing the Canadian program.
