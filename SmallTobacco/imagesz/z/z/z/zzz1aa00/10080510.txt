These data shov marked differences in recorded mortality rates
from lumg cancer between cities of different sizes, betveen cities of the
game gaze, and between cities in different regions.

There is no evidence of a significant correlation between per
espita omoking and these contrasting lung cancer mortality rates. There
are, in fact, wide discrepancies, (Manos, NE. 1957)

Hot only ere there wide and inconsistent differences between
mortality rates from total lung cancer recorded es both “primary” and
“unspecified,” there are also wide differences in the relation of recorded
incidence of the two categories to one another in different cities.

All these differences arc unexplained.

What do they mean in terms of accuracy ond reliability of
"death certificate” data?

What do they mean in terms of accuracy and relicbility of
@iagnesig and differentiation betveen primary and metastatic lung timors?

What do they mean in relation to any possible assceiation with
any opecifie environmental fector which may be selected for study?
