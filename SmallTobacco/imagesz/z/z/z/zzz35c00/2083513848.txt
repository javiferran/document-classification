Fewer women aged
18-44 are smoking,
phone survey says

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

CHICAGO — ‘The. smioldng rate i
foc American women of childbear- |
ing age declined significantly dur- j
ing a recent 10-year period, a |
newly reported phone survey indi- ‘
gates. 4

Researchers from the federal ;
Centers for Disease Control and ;
Prevention reported that the per
ventage of women of childbearing
age who had ever smoked declined
le 3K.2 percent in 1996 from 44.1
percent in 1987. Additionally, the
prevalence of current smo! ing de-
clined to 11.8 percent in 1996 from
16.3 percent in 1987.

The results of the telephone sur-
vey of 187,302 women aged 18 to
44 from 33 states appear in today’s
issue of the Journal of the Ameri-
van Medici sociation.

‘The researchers, led by Dr. Sha-
hul Ebrahim, said women who re-
ported they were pregnant were
about half as likely to be current
smokers as women who weren't
pregnant — a ratio that fluctuated
only slightly over the 10-year sur-
vey period.

In 1987, 16.7 percent of the preg-
nant women reported being smok- !
ers and 26.7 percent of the women |
who weren't pregnant said they °

smoked. By 1996, only 11-8 percent
of the pregnant women smoked

and only 23.6 of women who,

weren't pregnant did.

“In this analysis, the decline in
smoking over ime among pregnant
women was primarily due to the
overall decline in soioking initia~
tion. rates among women of child-
bearing age, not to an increased
rate of smoking cessation related to
pregnancy," the researchers wrote.

‘The researchers cautioned that
because the survey had excluded
women without telephones, women
younger than 18 and these who did
not live in private residences, they
may have underestimated the actu-
al prevalence of smoking.
