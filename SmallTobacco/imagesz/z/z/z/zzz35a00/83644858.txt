Mr. Randy Spell
MLL. Orlowsky

March 8, 2000.

Subject: Various - MPID

A few suggestions regarding various pieces of information to be considered for inclusion in
MPID reports:

Az

Minor Mannfacturers/Brand Report

Too much emphasis is placed on share of market analysis {see report dated 3/6), and not
enough on providing volume data, Percentage gains/losses of share is really not very
relevant as opposed to this comparison based on volume. The report should include
additional information related to volumes, i-e., annual shipments for 1998 and 1999, year-
to-date 2000, and an attempt to project annualized volumes for 2000, as well as
percentage changes. This does not have to be developed to the division level, but could
be helpful either on a regional or area basis. The report tends to dwell on what occurred
in the past. This is good up to a point, however, some hypothesizing as to futures would
be better. Since this report is based on Excei data, we should also consider similar
additions to the MSA shipment analyses.

Pricing Comparisons

Some time ago, we discussed developing average pricing comparisons to establish a
history as well as a current picture of the percentage differentials between the various
price segments of the matket. What is the status of this information?

Given the growing importance of minor brands, we shonid include, wherever possible, a
compicte view of the market by including the minors along with the majors. I am not
certain of the availability of the minor sales data. A review should be made te determine
what is available and how this information can be included as part of the on-going
analyses.
