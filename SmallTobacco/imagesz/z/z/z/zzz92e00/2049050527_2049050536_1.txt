HTI Test of Marlboro Lights 100mm Non-Menthol
â€˜versus
Benson & Hedges Lights 100mm Non-Menthol
(Project # 1286/8541)

BACKGROUND

The objective of this test was to determine consumer acceptability of
Production Marlboro Lights 100mm Non-Menthol relative to Production
Benson & Hedges Lights 100mm Non-Menthol. Analytically, the two
cigarettes differed as shown on the attached analytical sheet (Appendix
A). This test was conducted via mail placement/telephone interview
among smokers of Marlboro Lights 100mm NMF, Benson & Hedges Lights 100m
NMF and a cross section of other flavor low 100mm non-menthol smokers.
All products were tested "blind" in plain white coded packages. A
scalar sequential monadic ballot was used for this test (Appendix B).
All results were balanced for order of trial. The scales used in this
test were revised to match those currently in use by POL.

(Tables 1 & 2)

2. A review of the remaining qualitative information (Average Ratings
- Table 3; Reasons for Preference - Table 4; Dislikes - Table 5 and
Likes - Table 6) indicates that these Marlboro Lights smokers
perceived their own brand to have a milder taste and to be
less harsh. A large percent of the Marlboro Lights smokers
preferred their own brand because they were milder/not strong.

3. Among the Benson & Hedges Lights 100mm NMF smokers, no significant
differences were indicated on preference between Marlboro Lights
