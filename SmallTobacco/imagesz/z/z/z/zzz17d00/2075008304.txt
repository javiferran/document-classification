INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

Mr. J. Gibson Dote: December 5, 1984

W. F. Gannon

Japan Prototypes

While I have written nothing formally conerning telephone conversation
in question, the attached memo from R. L. Snyder adequately summarizes
the situation. While several people in Asia are copied, this fax

will arrive in time for your N.P.C. meeting whereas the actual copies

may not.
Please note that we have not as yet resolved the question of testing

an 80 mm Marlboro prototype cited in R. Snyder's point two.
Additionally, the timing for development and testing of prototypes

{last paragraph) appears unrealistic.
Will look forward to receiving feedback on discussions of your

N.P.C. meeting.
