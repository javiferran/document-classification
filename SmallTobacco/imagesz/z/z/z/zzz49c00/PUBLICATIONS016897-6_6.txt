[17,18]. These properties and the demonstrated
requirement of Mg?’ for maximal enzyme activity
in excess of that required for Mg2*- ATP complex
formation indicate that the enzymes from these
cell lines are similar to those of the erythrocyte or
kidney [16,17]. The kinetic properties of the trans-
formed cell extracts (maximal velocity. K,, for
methionine, Mg?* optimum. product inhibition by
S-adenosylmethionine) are not detectably different
from extracts of normal fibroblasts and of re-
vertants of the wansformed cells which grow either
on methionine or homocysteine media.

Regulation of mtracellular methionine and S-adeno-
sylmethionine levels in transformed and normal cell
dines

IntraceNular methionine levels have been mea-
sured in HeLa cells grown under similar condi-
tions to those used in this study. When the
methionine concentration in the medium was 100
uM, the intracellular pool was estimated to be
500-1500 »M [19). These values are at least 40-
times higher than the measured K,, values for
methionine for S-adenosylmethionine synthetase
in all cell types measured here (Table IID. Thus,
the synthetase is probably physiologically saturated
with methionine in cells grown on Met* Hey
medium. On the other hand, the rate of S-adeno-
sylmethionine formation may be limited by the
free methionine concentration in cells cultured in
the Met” Hcy* medium. This effect may be espe-
cially pronounced in methionine-dependent cells
where the level of free metthonine is about 20-times
lower than that found in methionine-independent
cells when both cell types are in Met” Hey’
medium (7). The lowered S-adenosylmethionine
level of methionine-dependent cells in Met Hey*
mecium [4] is thus likely to result from a smaller
pool of methionine and not from any molecular
defect in the S-adenosyimethionine synthetase in
these cells. It is not clear why free methionine
pools are reduced in transformed ceils grown un-
der these conditions [7].

Methtonme-dependence or homocysteme toxicity?
Because ‘methionine-dependen’ cells are de-
fined by their inability to grow in Met” Hey*
medium, it is possible that their growth inhibiuion
may be at least partially an effect of homocysteine

itself, perhaps as a result of overproduction of
S-adenosylhomocysteine [4,7], a potent inhibitor
of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylcrans-
ferases [6]. This idea is supported by the faci that
5’-methylthioadenosine. but not homocysieine, can
replace methionine for the growth of the methio-
nine-dependent human monocytic leukemia J112
cells [20,21]. lt should be noted, however, that
methionine-dependent W-256 rat cells can grow in
homocysteine medium (100 »M) when supple-
mented with only 1 2M methionine, a concentra-
tion insufficient in itself to allow normal growih
(3). In the later case, it would be necessary to
Propose that methionine would exert a sparing
effect on the homocysteine toxicity, possibly by
allowing an increase in the level of S-adenosyl-
methionine.
