Although the data shown in Figs. 1 and 2 were
obtained with extracts of a revertant methionine-
independent rat cell line (W-256 RL). similar re-
sults were found for the methonine-dependent
Parent (W-256) as well as for the SV-40 trans-
formed human revertant methionine-independent
cell line R1 (Table IH). Ali of the subsequent
experiments reported here were conducted under
these ‘optimal’ concentrations of ATP and Mg?*
of | mM and 20 mM, respectively.

Comparison of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase ac-
tutty in methionine-dependent and methionine -inde-
pendent cell ines

To test the hypothesis that the failure of trans-
formed cells ta grow in Met Hey* medium is due
to a defective S-adenosylmethionine synthetase,
we measured the V,, and the K,, for methionine
in dialyzed extracts of the cell lines shown in Tabie
1. Representative data for methionine-independent
normal fibroblasts are given in Fig. 3 and for
methionine-dependent SV-40-transformed fibro-
blasts compared to a methionine-independent re-
vertant in Fig. 4. Similar data were obtained for
other human as well as rat methionine-dependent
and -independent fibroblasts. The results of these
experiments are summarized in Table Ill. The
