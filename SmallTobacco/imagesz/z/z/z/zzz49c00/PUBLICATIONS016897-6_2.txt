freeze-thawing at — 70°C (solid CO, /isopropanol)
and 37°C, respectively. The post-mitochondrial su-
pernatant fraction was prepared from this lysate
by centrifugation for 20 min at 13800 x g at 4°C.
This supernatant contained the bulk of the S-
adenosylmethionine synthetase activity and was
generally dialyzed at 4°C for 16-24 h against
200-400 vol. of 10 mM Hepes, 160 mM KCl. 5
mM #-mercaptoethancl, 1 mM Na,EDTA ad-
justed to a pH of 7.4 with NaOH. The cell extracts
were either assayed immediately or were frozen at
— 70°C.

Protein determination. Protein concentrations
were determined using the method of Bailey (15]
against a standard of bovine serum albumin (Sigma
fraction V), the concentration of which was de-
termined by ultraviolet absorbance at 279 nm (4
10 mg/ml = 6.8). Both samples and standards were
Precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid before
analysis.

S-Adenosylmerhionine synthetase assay. Enzyme
activity was quantitated by measuring the inital
rate of formation of S-adenosyl-1-[ methyl-? H]me-
thionine from ATP and L-[methyl-> H)methionine
as described by Oden and Clarke [16]. Briefly. cell
extracts were incubated at 37°C in a total volume
of 0.1 ml containing final concentrations of 1 mM
ATP (equine muscle, disodium salt, Sigma), 20

chromatographically purified as described [16)).
The final pH was 7.4. Variations in this protocol
are noted in the text. After 15 to 60 min (in the
linear range of the assay), the reaction was
terminated by the addition of 1.0 m! of water at
0°C and 1.0 ml of the mixture was then applied to
a column containing 0.2 mi of acid and base
washed-Dowex AG 50W-X4 resin (Bio-Rad Labo-
ratories) in the NH{ form. Unreacted [mershyt-
?H)methionine was eluted with three-2 ml washes
of water, S-adenosyl-[methy/-*H)methionine was
then eluted with 1.0 ml of 3M NH,OH into 10 ml
of liquid scintillation cocktail (Aquamix, West
Chem Products) and counted on a Packard 3255
liquid scintillation spectrophotometer. Background
activity was determined from the radioactivity in
samples where water was substituted for enzyme in
the reaction.

CELLS AND THE EFFECT OF DIALYSIS

Pellet fracuon was prepared by incubating the pellet obtained an the first freeze-thaw lysis in 1% Tntan X-100, 160 mM sodium
Hepes, 120 mM KCl, pH 74, performing three cycles of freeze-thaw lysis, and subsequently remoung insoluble matenat by
centnfugauion at 13800x g a1 4°C for 20 mun. Assays were performed m dupbcate with 25.90 ug of extract proiemn. Supernatant
fraction assays were perfermed in duplicate wath 45-90 wg of extract protein. Total soluble activity is defined as the sum of the
activity (pmol /man) im the superaatant fracuon and in the Triton X-100 supernatant of the pellet fracuon.
