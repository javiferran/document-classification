FROM: Geoff Bible 5

As a follow-up to my memo of June 9th regarding a misleading and inaccurate
article that was published last week in The New York Times, 1 wanted to share
with you a copy of a letter sent to The New York Times yesterday from Jim
Morgan, President and CEO of Philip Morris U.S.A., setting the record straight.
In addition, we have widely distributed Jim’s letter to the general media.

We will continue to vigorously defend al! our businesses against distorted and
biased reporting.
