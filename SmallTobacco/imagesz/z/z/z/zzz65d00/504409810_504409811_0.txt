I. NEW PROCESS DEVELOPMENT

o

Carbonization of Stems

In PT&D's ongoing work to support use of carbonized
tobacco in products, a novel method of carbonizing stems
is under development. Bench scale tests are underway
utilizing plasma are welding equipment to simultaneously
and virtually instantaneously deliver extremely high
temperatures directly to the stems in an inert atmo-
Sphere thus avoiding ignition of the stems. This work
could lead to a continuous method of carbonizing vs. the
current batch methods which take times ranging from 1 to
5 days, depending on batch size.
