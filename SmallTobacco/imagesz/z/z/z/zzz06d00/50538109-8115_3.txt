monolayers with the protein kinase C inhibitor, H-7 (4 x
10-5 M), did not prevent PPAE cell retraction in re-
sponse to calcium chelation (change in peremability =
Con 1.21 + 0.07, H-7 alone 1.22 + 0.08, EGTA alone 1.63
+ 0.06, H-7 + EGTA 1.77 + 0.07, n = 12 for each group).
The same dose of H-7 did prevent an increase in mono-
layer permeability in response to 1 X 1077 M phorbol 12,
13-dibutyrate (data not shown).

DISCUSSION

The intent of these experiments was to further deter-
mine the role of myosin light-chain phosphorylation in
the retraction of endothelial cells. Schnittler et al. (22)

mo! P/m MLC was greater than control and control was greater than
cAMP-Hist or ML-9-Hist, P< 0.05 (n = 10 monolayers for each group).
MLC phosphorylation in HUVE cells exposed to cAMP or ML-9 for 80
min was not different from that in cells exposed for 10 min (data nat
shown).

fragment containing phosphorylated
Ser!®, Peptide fragments identified in
upper right have been identified as frag-
ments containing phosphorylated Ser or
Ser? and Thr®. Fragments identified
{lower) comigrate with that seen in up-
per left, indicating that in PPAE and
HUVE cells MLC is phosphorylated by
MLCK. Fragmenis near origin in lower

for MLCK and protein kinase C.

and Wysolmerski and Lagunoff (29) have suggested that
calcium initiated phosphorylation of MLC causes a con-
traction of the endothelial cell cytoskeleton and that this
mediates cell retraction. However, the experiments on
which this position is based used cells whose membranes
had been removed with detergents and required 50-100
#M calcium, an unphysiological level. Indeed, at 1-5 4M
calcium, very little contraction occurred (30).

Endothelial and other cells also retract when tethering
to adjacent cells and substrate is interrupted by chelating
extracellular calcium (19, 20, 25). These observations
would imply that there is a constitutive centripetal ten-
sion in the cells that is expressed when tethering is in-
terrupted. Since endothelial cell calcium stays in the
nanomolar range even after stimulation with agents
such as histamine, it is possible that the constitutive
tension mediates cell retraction in response to agonists
such as histamine, which could also affect cell tethering
(4, 11, 27).
