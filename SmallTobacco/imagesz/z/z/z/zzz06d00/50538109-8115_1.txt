MYOSIN AND ENDOTHELIAL RETRACTION ,

plated on 25-mm-diam polycarbonate filters (0.8-um pore size)
precoated with 30 ug/ml! of fibronectin as described (4, 25). All
cells were cultured in medium 199 (M199) and supplemented
with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HUVE cells) or 10% fetal
bovine serum (PPAE cells), basal medium Eagle vitamins and
amino acids, glucose (5 mM), glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100
u/mol), and streptomycin (100 ug/ml). All studies on HUVE cells
were performed on primary cultures which were 2 days postcon-
fluent at the time of study. Studies on PPAE cells were per-
formed on cells in passages 4-11 which were also 2 days post-
confluent at the time of study. Cultures were identified as
endothelial cells by their characteristic uniform morphology,
uptake of acetylated low-density lipoprotein (~99% of cells),
and by indirect immunofluorescent staining for factor VII
(HUVE cells) (~97% of cells). Because the cells are not visible
on the polycarbonate filters, for each experiment, a control well
was plated and examined for morphology to be certain that the
morphology was consistent with that of cells identified as endo-
thelial cells by these staining techniques.

Monolayer permeability measurements. HUVE cells and
PPAE cells were plated onto 9-mm_-diam gelatin- and fibronec-
tin-pretreated polycarbonate filters glued to ADAPS inserts as
described (26). The cells were cultured in M199 with 10%
(PPAE) or 20% FBS (HUVE) and used on day 7 after plating.
During the control period each monolayer was rinsed three
times with M199 and then 500 yl of M199 with 145 uM albumin
and ~ 100,000 counts per minute (cpm)/ml of [?“C]dextran (av-
erage molecular weight 64,000) were added to the luminal cham-
ber. Each monolayer was then placed into the well of a 24-well
tissue culture plate containing 1,500 yl M199 with 145 uM
albumin (these volumes balanced the fluid levels in the cham-
bers) and incubated for 30 min at 37°C in 5% CO.-95% air.
Each monolayer was then removed from the plate and 500 yl of
the medium taken from the well and counted in the scintillation
counter. For the second 30-min experimental period, each
monolayer was rinsed three times in M199. Then, 300 ul of
M199 with or without forskolin (2 x 10-5 M) and aminophyl-
line (1.2 x 1073 M), ML-9 (6 x 10-5 M), or H-7 (4 x 10-5 M)
with 145 4M albumin were added to the luminal compartment
of each monolayer, and the monolayer preincubated for 10 min.
After the 10-min preincubation, EGTA (PPAE cells, final con-
centration 2.0 mM) or histamine (HUVE cells, final concentra-
tion 1 X 1075 M) along with 100,000 cpm [“C]dextran was
added to the luminal compartment for a final luminal volume of
500 pl. Hach monolayer was then placed into the well of a
24-well tissue culture plate containing 1,500 ul of the same
solution that was in the luminal compartment, but without the
{'4C] dextran. After 30 min the monolayer was removed and the
lower chamber sampled as in the control period. Permeability
was calculated as follows

cpm through the monolayer bik
cpm/al x 30 main X60 5 x 0.6 em? x 1,000 ~ Permeability

(cpm/j] = cpm/yl of fluid on the luminal surface)

Data are reported as change from control permeability. Only
monolayers with a contro! permeability of <5 x 10~° cm/s were
used. Filters without a monolayer had a permeability 10 times
that of filters with a monolayer of endothelial cells.

Purification of human platelet MLC. Human platelet MLC
was purified from whole platelet myosin using the procedure
described by Daniel and Adelstein (6). Preparations were used if
contaminating kinases were not present. Whole platelet myosin
was purified according to Sellers et al. (23). Whole platelet myo-
sin was not a suitable substrate for generating in vitro peptide
map standards because it contained contaminating endogenous
kinases,

Isotopic labeling and stimulation. Cells designated for quan-
titating MLC phosphorylation were grown on micropore filters
and were labeled with 1.5 ml of (2°S)methionine (555 »Ci/ml) in
M199 with 10% FBS for 48 h at 37°C and 5% CO,. Labeling in
<10% FBS increased basal phosphorylation of MLC.

Cells designated for peptide mapping were washed three
times with a phosphate-free buffer containing (in mM) 119
NaCl, 5 KCI, 5.6 glucose, 0.4 MgCle, 1 CaCl, and 25 piperazine-
N,N’-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES) (pH 7.2), and were
then labeled with 3 ml of 300-400 »Ci/ml [32P orthophosphate
for 2 h at 37°C without CO,.

Labeled cells were exposed to either M199 with or without 2.0
mM EGTA, histamine (1 x 10-5 M), forskolin (2 x 1075 M) and
aminophylline (1.2 x 107> M), or ML-9 (6 x 10-5 M). The dose
of ML-9 was chosen based on the effective dose for intact
smooth muscle and platelets (10).

Reactions were terminated by snap freezing on a dry-ice
methanol bath, and the cells were lysed by thawing in 1 ml of a
buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mM sodium pyrophos-
phate, 250 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 g/ml leupeptin, 15 mM
B-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mM tris(hydroxymethy!)amino-
methane (Tris): HC! (pH 7.9). The lysate was sedimented at
100,000 g for 5 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was incubated
with 20 ul of rabbit anti-human platelet myosin antibody (2
mg/ml) at 4°C for 1 h. Fifty microliters of a prewashed S. aureus
cell suspension (Pansorbin) were then added to the suspension
which was incubated for an additional 30 min at 4°C (20). The
mixture was centrifuged (100,000 g for 1 min), the pellet was
washed with 0.5 ml of the lysing buffer, and recentrifuged. The
pellet was then washed with 0.5 ml of a 50:50 mixture of lysing
buffer and phosphate-buffered saline. The pellet was resus-
pended in 200 yl of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer
for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) or 35 ul of
urea-lysing buffer for two-dimensional electrophoresis.

Isoelectric focusing. The unphosphorylated and phosphory-
lated MLC isoforms were separated by two-dimensional elec-
trophoresis as described by Ludowyke et al. (16) but with the
following modifications. The sample was suspended in 35 ul of
a buffer containing 9.5 M urea (Boehringer Mannheim ultra-
pure urea), 4% Nonidet P-40, 0.04% pharmalyte (pH 4.5-5.4),
0.04% pharmalyte (pH 4-6.5), and 0.1 M dithiothreitol. Tube
gels were prepared using 1.5-mm-ID x 180-mm glass tubes. For
10 tubes, 2.78 g of ultra-pure urea were mixed with 1.5 ml of
H,0, 0.83 ml of 30% /0.8% acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 0.28 ml of
pharmalyte (pH 4-6.5), 0.28 ml of pharmalyte (pH 4.5-5.4), and
0.28 ml of 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonia]-1-pro-
panesulfonate (CHAPS) buffer (100 mg CHAPS, 0.3 ml HO
and 0.03 ml Nonidet P-40). Gels were drawn to a height of 150
mm. Gels were polymerized with 5 »l of TEMED and 10 ul
ammonium persulfate. Isoelectric focusing was performed using
a Bio-Rad model 175 cell.

The anolyte contained 0.01 M glutamic acid and the catho-
lyte contained 0.01 M histidine. Gels were prefocused at 25°C at
200 V for 2 h followed by 500 V for 5 h. Thirty microliter
samples were loaded onto the gel, covered with 10 ul of an
overlaying buffer which contained 8 M urea, 2% pharmalyte
(pH 3-10), and 0.5% pharmalyte (pH 4.5-5.4). Catholyte buffer
was layered over the overlaying buffer. The samples were then
electrophoresed at, 2,500 V for an additional 32,000 V-h.

Second dimension: SDS-PAGE. Tube gels were extracted and
rinsed with transfer solution [3% SDS, 0.07 M Tris-Base (pH _
6.7), 0.03 mg/ml bromphenol blue], layered onto a
polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide slab gel (15%/0.4%), and sealed
to the slab gel with hot agar [2.3% SDS, 0.062 M Tris-Base (pH
6.8), 0.5% agarose, and 5% 6-mercaptoethanol]. The gels were
run at 4°C for 18-20 h at 200 V. Gels were treated with
En3hance (Du Pont) to accelerate autoradiograph development.
