MYOSIN AND ENDOTHELIAL RETRACTION

ML-9 to prevent HUVE cell retraction in response to
histamine. The tryptic peptide maps demonstrated that
protein kinase C does not contribute to the basal phos-
phorylation of MLC in PPAE cells. Hence, inhibition of
protein kinase C by ML-9 cannot directly account for the
ability of ML-9 to reduce MLC phosphorylation. How-
ever, it is possible that protein kinase C phosphorylates
other cytoskeletal elements that contribute to the basal
tension in PPAK cells, and that ML-9’s efficacy was due
to inhibition of this phosphorylation. To test for this we
examined the ability of the protein kinase C inhibitor,
H-7 to prevent PPAE cell retraction in response to cal-
cium chelation. In contrast to ML-9, H-7 did not reduce
the effects of calcium chelation on PPAE cells. Hence, it
is unlikely that the ability of ML-9 to prevent PPAE cell
retraction in response to calcium chelation can be attrib-
uted to ML-9 inhibition of protein kinase C.

We examined two very different mechanisms for caus-
ing cell retraction, a histamine-stimulated increase of
centripetal tension and a chelation of extracellular cal-
cium-mediated loss of tethering. We then examined two
very different inhibitors of retraction, activation of the
cAMP-dependent kinase and an inhibitor of kinases,
with a relative specificity for MLCK (5, 7, 10). Both of
these inhibitors reduced phosphorylation of MLC, and it
is difficult to identify other mechanisms which both
could use to block retraction initiated by such different
mechanisms. Regardless, like almost all inhibitors, nei-
ther of these is entirely specific for MLC phosphoryla-
tion, and it is possible that effects other than inhibition
of MLC phosphorylation also contribute to their inhibi-
tion of retraction.

It is possible that forces other than MLC phosphory-
lation contribute to producing a centripetal tension in
endothelial cells. Kolodney and Wysolmerski (13) ob-
served that HUVE cells continued to express an increase
in isometric tension more than 40 min after stimulation.
In contrast, we found that MLC phosphorylation was
very transitory in HUVE cells and returned to basal levels
within 5 min of stimulation. Hence it is highly probable
that just as in smooth muscle, there is either a latch state
of acto-myosin or parts of the cytoskeleton in addition to
acto-myosin contribute to centripetal tension develop-
ment in endothelial cells (9, 26). Additionally, the tran-
sitory MLC phosphorylation may contribute to tension
development through mechanisms other than just acto-
myosin contraction. For example, MLC phosphorylation
promotes actin filament assembly, and histamine stimu-
lation of HUVE cells is associated with an increase in
actin filament assembly (3, 14).

In summary, we found that inhibition of MLC phos-
phorylation prevented endothelial cell retraction in re-
sponse to histamine and in response to chelation of ex-
tracellular calcium. Our data demonstrate that the
constitutive tension expressed in endothelial cells is ad-
equate to cause cell retraction when tethering is released
and that inhibition of MLC phosphorylation prevents
this retraction. We have not demonstrated that all of the
tension is dependent on MLC phosphorylation, but only
that retraction requires MLC phosphorylation. We have

also not answered the question about whether cell retrac-
tion in response to stimuli such as histamine occurs be-
cause of an increase in tension which itself disrupts teth-
ering, or whether retraction represents an increase in
tension and a parallel reduction in tethering. It will be
interesting to answer this question and to discover what
other processes may also be necessary for endothelial cells
to retract.
