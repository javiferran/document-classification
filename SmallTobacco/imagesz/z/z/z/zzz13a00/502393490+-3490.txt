Dear Sirs:

In the course of our studies in Health we have come across
a controversially question, Does cigarette smoking

cause lung cancer? We have chosen to have a debate

on this question.

As I was appointed to speak on the side defending
cigarette smoking, I thought your company could provide
me with some helpful information. I would appreciate
very much your reply. Thank you.

Sincerily,

dnd pe

Wanda Spease
