Subject: ABC Reminder

In the April ABC newsletter the front page article was about the development of a
Newspaper Reader Profile Service. Last November, ABC agreed to proceed in refining
research standrads and audit processes. The purpose of this Reader Profile Service was to
enhance comparison of audience profiles of newspapers across the country.

You had asked me to remind you about this study in carly July so you could check on it
when you attended the ABC meeting this month. I thought it might be interesting to get
the results of the carly test participants. Newspaper readership could vary from market to
market, especially given the availability of other "news" sources from market to market.
A market with a strong alternative newspaper might skew the readership of the daily
newspaper older, and if this press is non-existent, the 21-29 might be forced to read the
daily newspaper to learn about club events, ctc. If you want the newsletter to refresh your
memory - let me know and i'll give it to you.
