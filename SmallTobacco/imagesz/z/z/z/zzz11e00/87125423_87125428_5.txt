CONCIUSION

Rasen sh (Waters
Lorillard Chemicai-Company's test article B93, was tested in the Rat
Hepatocyte Unscheduled DNA Synthesis Assay. Based on the results of the
initial toxicity test, the test article was tested at 8 dose levels ranging

from 2000 ug/ml to 0.07 ug/ml. Five doses were fully evaluated as required
by the study protocol.

The results of the UDS assay indicate that under the test conditions, the
test article did not cause a significant increase in the Unscheduled DNA
Synthesis as measured by the mean number of net nuclear grain counts (i.e.,
an increase of at least 5 counts over the control), at any dose level. In
this study the positive control, 7,12-Dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA), induced
significant increases in the mean number of net nuclear grain counts over that
in the solvent control,
