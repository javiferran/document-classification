Study No. 1T4477.380

SUMMARY

Lorillard Chemical Company's test article, B93, was tested in the
Unscheduled DNA Synthesis Test using rat primary hepatocytes. Based on the
results of a preliminary cytotoxicity test, the test article was tested at 8
dose levels ranging from 2000 ug/ml to 0.07 ug/ml. The top 2 doses were
observed to be too toxic for further evaluation. Five doses (667 ug/ml to 0.7
ug/ml) were fully evaluated for Unscheduled DNA Synthesis.

The results of the UDS assay are summarized in Table 3. The results of
the UDS assay indicate that under the test conditions, the test article did not
cause a significant increase in the mean number of net nuclear grain counts
(i.e., an increase of at least 5 counts over the control), at any dose level.
Therefore, thé test article is considered negative in this study.
