Study No. 14477.380

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In the preliminary cytotoxicity assay, the test article, B93, showed a
relative toxicity (RT) of 100% at the top dose of 2001 ug/ml, 98.4% at 1000
ug/ml and less than 50% at 333 ug/ml and below.

The results of the parallel cytotoxicity are recorded in Table 2. The
maxim dose of the test article (2000 ug/ml) showed an RI of over 100%, the
dose at 667 ug/ml resulted in RT of 50% while lower doses were essentially
non-toxic.

The results of the UDS assay are summarized in Table 3. Slides treated
with B93 or DMBA were compared to the appropriate negative control. According
to the criteria set for evaluating the test results, both doses of the positive
control compound, DMBA, induced a significant increase in the average net
nuclear count of silver grains. None of the test article doses caused a
significant increase in the mean net nuclear counts. Criteria specified in the
protocol for a valid test were met.
