MEMORANDUM May 5, 1987

DEADLINE: May 15

To: Regional Vice Presidents/Directors

From: M. Hurst Marshall
George R. Minshew/

Earlier this year, you each received a copy of the TI workplace
video. The tape featured statements from Gray Robertson, Dr.
David Weeks and New York’s Paul Screvane, among others. We need
to know to what uses, if any, you have put that VHS tape.

By May 15, please send a short report to Walter Woodson on the
value of the tape and the ways in which you have employed it.
For instance, have you shown it to your lobbyists, allies or
lawmakers? Have you looked at it? We know, for example, that
the tape has been shared with councilmembers in Rancho Mirage,
California, and was presented at an ETS seminar in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania.

This information will be helpful to your colleagues. You may
have found a use for this resource that could be helpful
elsewhere. Finally, if you’ve found the message or the medium
inappropriate for field use, let us know why. Perhaps we could
“package the product" in a more useful fashion.

Please think this over and share your reports with us by May 15.
Thanks for your help.
