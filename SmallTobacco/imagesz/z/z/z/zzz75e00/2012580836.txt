Mr, Hetsko of American spoke to me Monday, August 3, He
advised that the company had taken a position with respect to the
Kolodny - Beatty luncheon matter. — .

I told him I did not know what he was talking about.

He explained Mr. Kolodny had asked for a luncheon meet~
ing which was attended by:

Messrs. Bantle of DU. S. Tobacco
Bowling of Philip Morris
Judge of Lorillard
McAllister and Provost of
Liggett & Myers
Mooney of American and
Wade of Reynolds. ‘

He stated that no Brown & Williamson representative was present.

He stated that he was calling all companies to tell then
that American's position was that they would go along with the pro-

posal subject to conditions as follows:

1. All of the other principal manufacturers
(six companies) agreed.

2. Everything was approved by the General
Counsel of each of the six companies.

I asked him how we, the General Counsel, would know what
‘was being done. He said that he had no answer.

I iterated that I knew nothing of the matter. T further
stated that you and I would not be able to talk until this week.

I gathered that there is some proposai, in writing, which
was distributed at the luncheon.

Paul D, Smith
