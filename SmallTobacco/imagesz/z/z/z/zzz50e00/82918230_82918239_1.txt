national with Raleigh Extra in a 70MM packing along with

NOTE: Volume and share trends for this 12-month period are
distorted by differences in excess. inventories generated
during March 1991 (due to price-increase terms offered by
all companies) versus March 1990 (when only quarter-end
allowances were offered by Philip Morris and B&W). Based on
more realistic company trends for the 52-weeks ending
5/10/91, when surplus inventories had been burned-off, it
can be seen that March point changes are particularly
understated for Philip Morris and B&W and overstated for
Reynolds and Lorillard.
