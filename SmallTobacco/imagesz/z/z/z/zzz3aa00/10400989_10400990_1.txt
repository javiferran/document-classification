only 104 coronary deaths occurred, not sigmfi-

Professos Oliver's reference to the North Karelia
proiect merits comment since our conclusions dif-
fer from his. At five vears (1, 2) a reduction in risk
factor levels was indeed noted. During this period
coronary heart disease rates did start to decrease in
North Karelia (in contradiction to Oliver's state-
ment), but no significant difference could then be
observed in coronary heart disease mortality trends
between North Karelia and the reference area

(3).

After 10 years of the programme, risk-factor lev-
els fell further (4), and when we analysed the latest
coronary heart disedse mortality trends for the per-
iod 1969-79 (5) for North Karelia, the reference
county, and all other counties—since the project
might also have special influence on the reference
area—the decline in coronary heart disease mor-

Moderation of dietary sodium, saturated fats, and

some of the unnatural and unhealthy dietary habits
we have so tecently adopted. D

tality in North Karelia had continued. For
1969-79, which includes eight vears of interven-
tion, Oliver gives the reductions in age-standard-
ized male coronary heart disease mortality as 24%
in North Karelia, 21% in the reference area, and
12% in Finland outside North Karelia. But he
should have cited our paper further: since the inter-
vention programme started only after the spring of
1972, it as important to note that most of the reduc-
tion in North Karelia took place after 1973, while
the reference area had a substantial reduction al-
ready before the programme started. The table
shows that the reduction in age-standardized cor-
onary heart disease mortality in men in 1974-79,
based on smoothing the curve by linear regression,
was about twofold in North Karelia compared with
the reference area or the rest of Finland (P<0.05,
