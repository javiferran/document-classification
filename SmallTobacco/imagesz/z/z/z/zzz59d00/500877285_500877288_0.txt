RE: PRESENTATION BY PROFESSOR DR. SCHMAEHL IN BERLIN
NOVEMBER 23, 1979 ,

Professor Schmaehl presented a lecture at the Berlin
meeting of Clinicians and: Otorhinolaringoflogic Specialists
on November 23, 1979, on the pathogenesis of malignant tu-
mors in the oral cavity, larynx, esophagus and lung. There
is no doubt that the attending doctors were strongly moved
by the lecture. Prof. Schmachl knew how to present the
relationships in a short period and illuminating manner,
whereby the presentation was less scientific and more designed
for a continuous education for the participatns. -In discussing
the subject, Prof. Schmaeh] raturally included the problem of
smoking and health. He presented the problem in a restrained
â€˜manner which is worth noticing. He emphasized the following:

1. Smoking is one risk factor among many and it is
exclusively up to the smoker to decide whether he is
willing to take the risk associated with smoking.

2. The introduction of filter cigarettes reduced very
significantly the risk of smoking. It is possible that
further progress in cigarette manufacture will lower.
the risk still further. ,

3. The idea advanced by Prof. Oeser, that cancer deaths HF
are "fate", may be correct. However, this concept can
hardly satisfy a scientist. More so, because of the

evidence oY the possibility of cancer induction in

animal experiments and seemingly also in humans of

every age group with chemical substances and environ-

mental factors.

4. There are no indications that certain psychological
dispositions play a role in carcinogenesis, the opposite
may rather be the case.

5, The presentation lasted about 45 minutes, the subject
of smokinr was dealt with for about five to ten minutes.
The short .ime used for this subject should have created
the impression that today's smoking can not be so dangerous.
