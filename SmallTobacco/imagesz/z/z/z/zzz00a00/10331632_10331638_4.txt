Materials and Methods

Cells and Culture Conditions. Normal tat 3¥1 cells and
3Y1 cells tansformed by a temperature-sensitive dernv-
ative of Fujyinam: sarcoma virus, NY225 (17, 18), were
maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle’s medium sup-
plemented with 10% calf serum. At the nonpermissive
temperature (40°C), the cells are nontransformed,
whereas at the permissive temperature. (35°C), the cells
assume the transformed phenotype (17. 18). Confluent
cell cultures were made quiescent by maintaining the
cultures in conditioned medium for 4 days NIH3T3 cells
