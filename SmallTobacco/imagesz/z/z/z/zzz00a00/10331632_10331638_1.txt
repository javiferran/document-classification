To determine whether v-Fps-induced Egr-1 was at the
level of transcription, we subjected 3Y¥1-NY225 cells to
nuclear run-on analysis (19). Radioactively labeled RNA
from nucle: isolated fram 3¥1-NV225 cells maintamed at
both nonpermissive and permissive temperatures for v-
F ps was hybridized to Egr-1 and control DNAs. Activating
v-Fps led to an increase in Egr-1 transcnption that was
similar to the increase in v-F ps-induced Egr-1 RNA levels
(Fig. 1b). Thus, the increase in Egr-1 transcripts induced
by v-Fps can largely be explained at the Jevei of transc rip-
tion.

v-Fps-induced Egr-1 Expression ts Independent of PKC.
Egr-1 has been shown to be induced by phorbol esters
that activate PKC (20, 21). We previously demonstrated
that v-Fps uses a PKC-medhated signaling pathway to
induce gene expression in chicken fibroblasts (6); how-
ever, the mduction of Egr- 1 by the protein-tyrosine kinase
v Src was Independent of PKC (22). We therefore wished
to determine whether v-F ps-induced Fgr- 1 was mediated
hy PKC To examine whether PKC was required for v-
Fps to induce Egr-1 expression, 3¥1-NY225 cells were
treated with PMA for prolonged perods of time to de-
plete cells of PKC (23). We demonstrated previously (24)
that this treatment reduced PKC to undetectable levels
by Western analysis using an antbody raised against a
conserved region of the catalytic domain of PKC (25).
Depleting cells of PKC had no effect on v-Fps-induced
Egr-1 expression, whereas the induction of Egr-1 by
phorbol dibutyrate was completely abolished (Fig. 2).
These data suggest that v-Fps-induced Egr-1 expression

Egr-1 Promoter Activation by v-Fps and Activated
Forms of HaRas and Raf-1. HaRas and Raf-1 have been
implicated in protein-tyrosine kinase-induced transfor-
mation (26-33). Dominant negative mutants for HaRas
(13. 14) and Raf-1 (15) have been characterized, making
it possible to implicate these signaling intermediates in
intracellular signaling pathways. To use the dominant
negative mutants for HaRas and Raf-1, we established a
transient expression assay to examine the induction of
Egr-1 expression. Hf either HaRas or Raf-1 1s part of the
intracellular signaling pathway activated by v-F ps leading
to the induction of Egr-1, the activated oncogenic forms
of HaRas and Raf-1 might also induce Egr-1 expression
pEgs-1 Pt.2 15 a plasmid vector that contains Egr-1 pro-
moter sequences encompassing the region —957 to +248
relative to the transcriptional start site linked to the CAT
gene (34) (Fig. 3a). pEgr-1 P1.2 was cotransfected into
NUH 373 cells with pl¥2.3 (35), pv-HaRas (13), and p3611
(36) (Fig. 3a), which express v-Fps, v-taRas, and v-Raf-
1. respectively. Forty-eight h posttransfection, cell ex-
tracts were assayed for CAT activity. As shown in Fig. 3b,
CAT activity was increased at least 6-fold over basat levels
when vectors expressing v-Fps, v-FaRas, or v-Raf-1 were
cotransfected with pEgr-1 P?.2. Cotransfection with the
parental vectors for v-Fps, v-HaRas, or a vector express-
ing a v-Raf-1 deletion mutant (37) had no effect on CAT
activity (Fig. 3b). Consistent with data presented in Fig. 2
utihzing 3Y1 cells, activation of the Egr- 17 promoter by v-
Fps was insensitive to depleting cells of PKC (data not
shown) The data presented in fig. 3 demonstrate that, in
addition to v-Fps. activated forms of HaRas and Raf-1
induce gene expression under the control of the Egr-1
promoter. Thus, it is possible that cellular forms of HaRas
and Raf-1 are components of a PKC-independent intra-
cellular signaling pathway activated by v-Fps. leading to
the induction of Egr-1 gene expression.
