v-Fps-induced Intracellular Signals

formed as described previously (47). Radiolabeled RNA
(2 * 10° cpm) from 3¥1-NY225 cells was hybridized for
48 h to DNA immobilzed on nylon membranes.

Plasmids. pEgr-1 P1.2 contains the CAT gene under
the contro! of the Egr-1 promoter (34). piV2.3 (35) con-
tains a gag-ips fusion gene cloned into an SV2neo vector
(48). pZIP M17 contains the Ha-ras gene with Asn-17
substituted for Ser-17 1n pZIPneoSV(X) (14). p301-1 con-
tains a mutated raf-1 gene, with the lysine in the ATP-
binding site changed to tryptophan. cloned into pMNC
(15) pv-HaRas expresses the v-Ha-ras gene in
pZiPneoSViX) (13): p3611 expresses a gag-raf fusion gene
(36), and pHT25 expresses the v-mos gene of Moloney
sarcoma virus (39).

Cell Transfection. NiHi 313 cells were plated at 5 x
10° cells in 100-mm dishes 20 h prior to transfection.
Transfections were performed using the CaPO. method
as described previously (38, 47).

CAT Assays. Transfected cultures were washed 16- 20
h posttransfection, and fresh medium containing 1%
serum was added. After another 30 h, cells were har-
vested after washing twice with cold ssotonic buffer,
resuspended in 200 ul of 250 mm Tris-HCI (pki 8 0), and
lysed by five cycles of freeze-thaw (dry ice-methanol at
37°C) for 5 min each. Supernatants were collected after
microcentnfuging for 5 min at 4°C. CAT activity in cell
extracts was determined using the fluor diffusion assay
(49) as described previously (47)
