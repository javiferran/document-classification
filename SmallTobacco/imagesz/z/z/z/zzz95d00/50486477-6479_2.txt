ongoing experiments to determine if a potential second receptor is likely, If so, our
approach will be to (1) generate monoclonals against membranes of either our
established line or primary nasal epithelial cells and identify those that block infection
with HCV-OC43, (2) identify the protein(s) recognized by the antibody, (3) obtain
amino acid sequence data and (4) clone the gene from an epithelial cell cDNA library.
It is possible that HE and S act in concert to initiate an infection and may be quite
complex. Our studies are designed to address this possibility and try to sort out the
role of each in this case. We previously demonstrated that bromelain removes S from
virions, whereas, HE appears to not be altered. We will use this property to determine
if these viruses can infect cells in the absence of S. We have also generated vaccinia
recombinants that express HE and will make use of this expression system to generate
229E virions that have HE incorporated into them to address the role of HE in the
infection process.

We will undertake animal studies to determine the route of spread from the initial point
of infection to the brain. We want to determine if the two human viruses targets to the
brain in a similar manner and if HCV-OC43 exhibits a Specific tropism for neurons. A
mouse model will be used for these studies, After intranasal infection the route of
spread will be followed by in situ hydridization and PCR analyses. We have all the
necessary clones and have worked out a PCR protocol to detect both HCV-OC43 and
HCV-229E in infected tissue culture cells.

Duration and Costs

We anticipate that the study will take 3 years with an estimated annual direct cost of
$90,000.
