Human Coronavirus Receptors

Background and Significance

Coronaviruses are one of 14 RNA virus families that infect humans and a broad range
of domestic animal species. Some of the viruses appear to be zoonotic. They are a
medically important group of viruses exhibiting tropisms for the lung, intestine, liver,
brain, kidney, eye, heart, and peritoneum resulting primarily in respiratory,
gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. In humans, they are known
to cause acute respiratory infections and gastroenteritis. However, they have been
implicated in association with acute lethal necrotizing enterocolites in children (Science
229:978, 1985), chronic enterocolites or Sprue (Dig. Dis.Sci. 27:1039, 1982),
pericarditis (J. Med. Virol. 6:259, 1980) and multiple sclerosis (Science 209:933,
1980; Ann. Neurol. 31:525, 1992; Talbot et al, Virol, in press). Two recent studies
show that a significant sample of multiple sclerosis brain tissue was positive when
either specific probes or PCR were used to detect coronavirus nucleic acid (Ann,
Neurol. 31:525, 1992; Talbot et al, Virol., in press). This is particularly significant
since coronaviruses infect humans and could possibly serve as a cofactor in such a
neurological disease. Recently a primate model was used to show that the primate CNS
is susceptible to infection with coronaviruses (Virol 188:274, 1992). It has been
clearly shown that coronaviruses can target to the brain of experimentally infected mice
(Perlman, et al., 1989, 1990). It seems reasonable to postulate that such may also
occur in humans during the course of a "normal respiratory infection" with these
viruses. It is well documented that coronaviruses can readily establish persistence in
both tissue culture and in the animal. This may apply to humans as well. Our
proposed studies are significant in that they will increase our understanding of the
initial step in infection of the human respiratory tract by coronaviruses and allow us to
begin studies toward understanding how these viruses also infect the CNS.

 

Three receptors have been identified thus far for coronaviruses. The receptor for the
mouse hepatitis coronavirus-A59 (MHV-A59) is a member of the carcinoembryonic
antigen family. Aminopeptidase N, also known as CD13, was recently identified as the
receptor for the human coronavirus-229E and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus
(TGEV) (Nature 357:417; 420, 1992). All of these coronaviruses have two major
envelope proteins, the spike (S) and matrix (M). In all cases S interacts with the
receptor. Some coronaviruses have, in addition to the S and M, a third major envelope
protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE). BCV, a bovine coronavirus, expresses HE
and this protein can use N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac3) as a receptor
determinant to initiate an infection (J. Gen. Virol. 73:901, 1992). The data from this
study suggests that a second receptor may be involved. The receptor(s) for the human
coronavirus OC43 has not been identified. HCV-OC43 does bind Neu5,9Ac> on
erythrocytes (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 85:4526); however, we do not know if :hig
is a receptor determinant on cells that are normally infected by this virus. Data from
