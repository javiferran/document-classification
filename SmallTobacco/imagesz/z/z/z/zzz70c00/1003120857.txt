nig! Following a recent conversation with Grant Gellatly, I would
olike you to be aware that we are still very much interested in obtaining
the cigarettes described in the attached memorandum (Osdene, T. S. Ciga-
‘rette Samples for Extramural Studies. Memo to L. Turano; 1982 October 12):

 
  

moose es" Barlier this year we advised an outside laboratory that will-
be involved in evaluating the requested samples that they would be avail-
able in the fourth quarter of 1983. Please advise me (or Bob Carpenter)
“at your earliest convenience as to when you think we will have these
samples. We would appreciate. having the information as soon as possible,
particularly if you anticipate that their availability will be delayed
into 1984, .

“Thank you for your cooperation and assistance. ~
