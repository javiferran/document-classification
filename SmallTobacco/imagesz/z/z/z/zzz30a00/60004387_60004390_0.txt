ABSTRACT -

Bicchemical entagonism between heparin and ascorbic acid was
described (Owen et. al., 1970). Ascorbic acid is found in high
concentrations in adrenal and testicular tissue and piays an
important role in steroid synthesis in these tissues. To determine

s
with ascorbic acid, levels of testosterone were studied in testi-
cular tissue of adult male Syrian golden hamsters and in testicular
| plasma of adult male Sprague-Dawiey rats during heparin treatment.

 

To determine concentrations of testosterone in tissue the
double isotepe derivative assay method was used, Radioimmunoassay
was used to detexmine testosterone concentrations in plasme., Wo
inhibitory effect was Getected when testosterone comeentrutions in

~ the treated groups were compared with these in the control groups.

INTRODUCTION

The interplay of sex hormones has been known to be associated
with ascorbic acid metabolism in various animals, Testosterone -
administration to castrated male albiro rats was found to restore
hepatic contents of ascorbic acid metabolites to the shum control
levels (Khandwekar et. al., 1974). It was suggested that the
functional OH group at C-17 in androgens might have some role in |

ascorbic acid metabolism, The heparin-inhibiting effect of
