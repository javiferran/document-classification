SUBJECT: Funding For Air Purification Device
Development, Prototype Construction,
and Testing

Assisting in the Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) investigation for
Fundamental Research and Development Department at Bowman Gray Technical
Center (BCTC), we have designed subject device. Development and testing of
this device has the potential of reducing the impact of “ETS” in public
buildings particularly food service and entertainment establishments.

We are requesting a grant of $4500 to accomplish subject work. To the best of
our knowlewdge at this time these funds will cover the cost of engineering,
materials and labor required to fabricate a prototype and testing to develop
effectiveness data for this device.

Legal council at BGTC is presently investigating patentability of subject
device. A decision should be reached by mid November on this matter.

If this funding is granted and we are advised to proceed with this work the
prototype can be constructed and ready for testing by January 1, 1988.

Please advise as to how we can further assist you in this matter.
