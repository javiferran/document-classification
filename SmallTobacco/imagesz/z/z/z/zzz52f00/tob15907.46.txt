King Harris, co-anchor:

It's been two decades since cigarette ads were kicked off
television. Now the tobacco industry's offering a new set of ads
to television stations urging children not to smoke. The Tobacco
Institute's spots calls for kids to talk to their parents before
lighting up. There's also an 800 number you can call to get a
free booklet on how to help your youngsters avoid the habit.

Tobacco Institute)

campaign. A spokesman called it a calculated campaign that makes
smoking appear to be an adult habit.

Jane Rinka, co-anchor:

Which we know it’s not. Smoking is unfortunately one of the
causes of health problems which keep the demand for medical
professionals high.
