Dear Mr. Clodfelter:

This is in reply to your inquiry concerning use of Eastman Kodak
Company's trademark ESTRON.

ESTRON is a trademark for acetate fiber or tow and therefore
should not be used to identify filters. We suggest that you
refer to your filter as an "acetate filter", "acetate fiber
filter", or "fiber filter". However, if you particularly
wish to use the trademark EST RON, the following statements.
are suggested (1 and 2 being preferred) as being lawful .
â€˜usage of the trademark in reference to filters manufactured |
entirely from ESTRON tow:

1. A filter of ESTRON Desber

2. A filter of ESTRON @material
3. Filter of ESTRON*

4h, All ESTRON* filter -

5. 100% ESTRON* filter

(The asterisk in the above statements shoulda |
refer to an explanatory footnote reading.
"fiber trademark" or "registered fiber trade-
mark", this footnote to appear in a reason-
ably prominent position on the vehicle of |
publication such as package, carton, or
advertisement. )

For protection of the trademark the word ESTRON must appear ina .

Gistinctive fashion. It should be capitalized, at least; or if.
the rest of the words in the phrase in which it appears are
capitalized,.ESTRON should receive some distinctive treatment

such as quotation marks, aizferent vype Lace or type size,
underlining, or color.
