MEMORANDUM
January 19, 1976

TO: Mr. J. R. Ave
FROM: A. B.. Hudson

SUBJECT: Kent Golden Light Menthol

Based on the information I have obtainedâ€™, the extra-
polated sales off KGL on an annualized, national basis will
be approximately five (5) billion units. It would appear
that an unusually good. opportunity to increase the sales
impact of this brand will be missed if we do not introduce
a KGL Menthol..

The supportive data for this opinion is shown in Tables
land 2. These tables list the availllable sales data for
brands. that have been introduced since 1966 with a companion
menthol. Table 1. shows the sales of competitive products. as
reported by Maxwell and Table 2 lists the sales of Lorillard
products as reported by Maxwell, except where noted.

As can be seen, the average percent of sales of the
menthol products: relative to the non-menthol for the com-
petitive brands is 54%, andi for the Lorillard brands 57.6%.
Assuming this data would translate if a KGL Menthol was
introduced, the anticipated sales of the menthol brand
would be approximately two to three billiion units during
the first year of introduction.

In evaluating the data shown in the Tables, it should
be remembered that one of the most accepted methods: of fore-
casting sales trends isi a technique called "exponential
smoothing". This simply means: that the most recent data is
given the most weight in the forecast. Because off this, any
data for brands: introduced before 1966 would be superfluous
for this type of forecasting. It can also be seen that if
only the brands: which have been introduced recently are
considered, then the percent of menthol sales relative to
the non-menthol would be greater than 603.
