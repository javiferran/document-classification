New York 17, New York —

‘Dear Dr. Hockett:

In keeping with the regulations for my fellowship, I enclose
herewith a report covering the major direction of my work
in the Tissue Culture Laboratory during the first six months
of my stay in the United States. The format of this report
is the result of a suggestion from Dr. Pomerat since I did
not know exactly how much detail you wanted of the work at
this time.

It is a pleasure to assure you that I am finding my fellowship
experience very profitable.

Sincerely yours,

“y. H. Nakanishi
