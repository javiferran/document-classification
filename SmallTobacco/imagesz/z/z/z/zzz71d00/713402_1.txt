Mr. Wyatt Wk.iams aoe C one 30, 1978

We sincerely appreciate the effort you, Kent Myhre; and Cecil
Wigmore put toward making this happen. From what we saw,
the Donrey personnel were extremely responsive to all the
pressures placed on them.

Thank you once again for your help and we will be looking forward
to hearing from you on the questions listed above.

Sincerely,

L3en-
