Dear Wyatt:

Ted, Gary, and I spent the day in Little Rock yesterday riding the
Rich Lightsâ€™ showing and we were pleased to find that, with one
exception, all the postings were in very food condition.

The one exception was a 30-Sheet board posted at 7th and Park
which was flagging and was also obscured by atree. Due to the
limited visibility, we recommend that that posting be moved to
a different location as opposed to simply correcting the flagging
problem.

There were also two locations that we could not find. One is
indicated on the map as a new location at U.S. 67 and 167 near
the Little Rock Air Force Base, and the other was indicated on
the map at the Junction of U.S. 70 and 130. The only 30-sheet
locations near the latter point were Bordon and Camel Lights.
Could you please advise the status of these two locations.

Finally, we saw a VICEROY parent 30-sheet location located

inbound on Highway 167 one mile west of the Rixie exit which was
virtually falling apart (the physical structure and the paper). The
structure had Baird on it, not Donrey. The location is very good;
however, we should not be paying for it due to its condition. We

would like to have the board completely stripped since its advertising
value is worthless and, in its present condition, is probably detrimental.
Could you please check this out for us.

_ Wyatt, our net impression is that, given that the Little Rock plant a
"is pretty average, to start with, Rich Lights now looks better, as _
"far as posting conditions go, than any other showing: in the market.
