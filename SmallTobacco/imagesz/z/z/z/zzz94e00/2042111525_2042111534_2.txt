The average overall ratings assigned by these smokers on a "1" (worst)
to "7" (best) scale are consistent with the overall preference vote in

| that Winston Red 85mm (4.47) was rated significantly higher (90%
level), than Marlboro Red 85mm (4.19).

A review of the remaining qualitative information (Average Ratings -

Table 3; Reasons For Preference - Table 4; Dislikes - Table 5 and
Likes - Table 6) indicates that these Winston soft pack smokers

perceived their own brand to be more satisfying. Marlboro was
perceived to be milder tasting.
