We have calculated an adjusted yield of PO from the cigs you tested and
it is about 10%. The attached spreadsheet has the calculations. Can you
check to see if you agree with what we have done? As a side note we use
about 40,000 ug of PG per cig. Please respond via email as we need to
make cigs as soon as possible.

Thanx,
