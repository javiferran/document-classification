Importantly, there was some indication that the smooth, rich
connotation associated with gold color in the advertising may
have promoted a certain expectation within some people which the
product did not fulfill. (Steps have already been taken by the
Agency to help alleviate this impression. Additionally, the
Concept Product Test will address this matter and the extent to
which it occurs in greater detail).

When asked for their preference between a cork or white tip
product, most panelis$s favored the type they were smoking.
Males preferred a cork tip (obviously because many of them were
smoking Marlboro and Winston) while females were less adamant in
their preference. Females who smoked cork seemed to go either
way while those that smoked a white tip were hard-pressed to
change. ee" Ba

MARKETING IMPLICATIONS

The True Gold concept generated positive results and follow-up
research is warranted.

Based on reaction to the various advertising approaches it would
seem that subtle modifications are indicated prior to this
undertaking with the emphasis placed on Personal Best.

 

The most notable refinement should reflect a "toning down" of the
gold color in Personal Best as this may help to reduce its

feminine quality and derived product expectations (ultra rich and
smooth). . .

Under ordinary circumstances we would recommend additional
qualitative work to measure reactions to these changes. Since
time is tight, we alternately recommend proceeding with
quantitative concept/product testing utilizing the Personal Best
concept along with the PM Taste-Alike product.

 

 

Advertising testing should be done simultaneously so that we
leave enough time to make changes prior to Test Market launch.
