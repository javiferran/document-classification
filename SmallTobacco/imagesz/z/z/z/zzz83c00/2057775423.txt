PM USA Statement/OSHA

 

Last night PM USA released a statement in which we
calied on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) to withdraw its plan to virtually ban smoking from the
nation's workplaces.

Our statement coincides with our submission today,
OSHA,

ta
of a five-volume legal brief outlining why we believe
OSHA's pian is flawed.

A copy of PM USA's statement is on the back of this
sheet. I hope you will take a few minutes to read it.
