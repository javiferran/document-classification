the HDL contained no detectable apoB-100. Lipoprotein concentrations were
determined by a modified Lowry assay (36) and the apoprotein composition
verified by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Glu-plas-
minogen was purified as described (16, 37}.

Radiolabeling of proteins and lipoproteins. Lpta) and Lp(a)-free LDL
were iodinated using the iodine monochlaride method (38, 39). Specific activi-
ties were 0.60 + 0.03 and 0.56 + 0.02 pCi/ug for °5]-Lpfa) and "-LDL, re-
spectively, and the '*]-Lp(a) and '°51-LDL preparations were 98 + 2 and 97 +
3% precipitable, respectively, in 13% trichloroacetic acid. The integrity of the
'25]-Lp(a) particle was assessed by immunoprecipitating the ligand with the pan
apoB-100 specific monoclonal antibody, MB4? (40). 2ST-Lp(a) was 88% im-
munoprecipitated under conditions where 91% of ”51-LDL was immunopreci-
pitated. In addition, monoclonal antibodies to apota} (specificity verified with
recombinant apo(a)) immunoprecipitated 90% of the "S1-Tp(a) under condi-
tions where <2% of the ?5[-LDL preparation was immunoprecipitated. Plas-
minogen was radioindinated using a modified chloramine T procedure as
described (41).

Cells. U937 manocytoid cells were grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented
with 5% FCS, penicillin G (100 U/ml), 2 mM glutamine and streptomycin
(100 wg/ml). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (second pus-
sage) were cultured as described (42). Unless otherwise indicated, none of
the cells were exposed wo medium containing lipoprotein-depleted serum.
Thus, the high affinity apoB/E receptor for LDL was down regulated in the
cells studied.

Ligand binding assays. U937 cells, at 4 X 10¢%ml in Hanks’ balanced salt *

solution, 0.05 M HEPES, pH 7.4 (HBSS) were incubated with 5] ligands and
competitors in the presence of a final concentration of 0.1% bavine serum
albumin [BSA (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA)] for the times and under the divalent
ion conditions indicated in each experiment. Bound and free ligands were
separated by layering 50 1] triplicate samples over 300 pl of 20% sucrose in
HBSS and centrifuged for 2.5 min in a Beckman microfuge (Beckman Instru-
ments, Inc.), As the density of the sucrose solution is 1.08, "5]-Lp(a) that is not
cell-associated should remain in the supernalant, Over the course of these ex-
periments <0.04% of the added !25]-Lp(a) was recovered in the tube tips after
centrifugation in the absence of cells, The tips of the tubes were cut off and
counted in an Iso-Data gamma counter (Iso-Data, inc., Palatine, IL}. The num-
ber of molecules or particles of ligand bound/cell was determined from the
specific activities of the radiolabeled ligands. Unless otherwise indicated, ull
binding data are presented as the means + standard deviations.

Since Lp(a) is a large lipoprotein particle, we sought to verify that our
binding assay provided sufficient separation of bound from free tigand. This
was determined by applying the washing procedure used by Ho et al (43) to
measure LDL. binding to celts. Briefly, binding assays were carried out in
duplicate volumes of 200 1. Following the incubation, the tubes. were cen-
trifuged in a Beckman Microfuge 12 at 12,000 rpm for 2 min at 22°C. The
Supernatant was removed, the pellet was rinsed (but not resuspended) with
Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, 884 uM CaCl, and 20 mg/ml BSA
(Buffer M) and centrifuged again at 12,000 rpm for 1 min at 22°C. The Super-
natant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 75 yl of Buffer M; 65 jal
were then applied to a 20% sucrose cushion (300 il in Buffer M) and centri-
fuged for 2.5 min at 22° C at 12,000 1pm. The results were compared for incu-
bation mixtures that had been directly applied to the sucrose cushions without
the washing step. At an input concentration of 10: nM STL p(a), 4.6 + 0.2 X
10° and 5.3 + .04 X 10° molecules were hound per cell and total binding was
inhibited by 72% and 76% by 0.6 uM unlabeled Lp(a) for the washed and
unwashed conditions, respectively. At an input concentration of 10 nM
"S[-plasminogen, 10+ 2,7 X 10% and 7.8 + 0.6 X 10* molecules were bound
per cell and total binding was inhibited by 92% and 95% by 0.2 M EACA for
the washed und unwashed conditions, tespectively. These results indicate that
phase separation was not only adequate but also effective.

Binding isotherms were constructed by adding increasing amounts of
"51-Lp(a) or '51-plasminogen to cells for 150 min at 37° C, and the data were
analyzed using the Delta Graph Program on a Macintosh [lIsi computer for
curve fitting and Scatchard plots. For studies to measure reversibility of
binding, '5I-Lp(a) was bound to U 937 cells for 150 min at 37°C ina volume

 

of 200 il. Samples were then diluted to 10 ml with HBSS. Fifteen minutes
later, the samples were centrifuged and the cell pellet was counted for radio-
activity. Cell recovery, from the diluted volume, measured using *!Cr labeled
cells, was determined to be >80%, To calculate percent reversible binding, the
amount of "51-Lp(a} recovered with the diluted cell samples was compared ta
that bound to the undiluted samples, correcting for celt recovery.

For ligand binding analyses with confluent HUVEC monolayers. the cells
were washed four times with HBSS supplemented with 23 mM CaCl, and
0.8 mM MgSO, Then radiolabeled ligands and competitors were added in a
volume of 200 wl. Following incubation for 2 h at 4° C the unbound "S]Heands
were removed by washing four times with HBSS containing 0.1% BSA. The
cell-associated "5[-ligands were extracted with 0.1% SDS (sodium dodecy]
sulfate). This washing protocol is similar to that used to measure lipoprotein
and plasminogen binding to adherent cells (44-46). When culture wells were
treated with BSA alone, minimal Lp(a) binding was detected.

Reagents. Gangliosides and related molecules, soy bean trypsin inhibitor,
crystalline enolase from rabbit muscle and ovalbumin were from Sigma
(St. Louis, MO). RNAse was from Worthington (Frechold, NJ). Trasylol was
from FBA Pharmaceutical (New York, N.Y.). Porcine pancreatic carboxy-
peptidase B (CPB) was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The cell line secreting
the monoclonal antibody W6/32 was from American Type Culture Collection,
and the purified IgG was a gift from Dr. Dario Altieri, The Scripps Research
Institute, La Jolla, CA.

Lp(a} Interacts with Cellular Binding Sites for Plasminogen
and Lipoproteins

As the focus of our studies was to characterize the interaction of
Lp(a) with plasminogen receptors, conditions optimal for plasminogen
binding (37° C without added divalent cations) were selected for analy-
sis. Interactions with the high affinity apoB/E receptor for LDL (typi-
cally measured at 4°C, in the presence of calcium and using cells
grown in lipoprotein-depleted serum) should be minimized under these
conditions. In addition, to minimize potential interactions with scaven-
ger receptors, unstimulated U937 cells were used as this cell line exhi-
bits minimal scavenger receptor expression (47) unless treated with a
differentiation inducing agent (48). Under these experimental condi-
tions, the interaction of '°5]-Lp(a) with U937 cells was examined. With
"51-Lp(a) at 10 nM, time-dependent binding was observed that reached
an apparent steady state at 120 min.

To assess the specificity of this interaction, we compared the effects
of nonlabeled Lp(a) and several other protcins on "3]-Lp(a) binding
(Table 1). Nontabeled Lp(a) produced extensive inhibition (73%) indi-
cating that the interaction of the radiolabeled ligand involved a limited
number of binding sites, i.e., was saturable, Despite being present at a
100-fold molar excess, four unrelated proteins produced minimal inhi-
bition of binding (<15%), suggesting that the interaction of 'S]-Lp(a)
with the cells was specific. Notably, <3% inhibition of binding was
produced by albumin (80mg/ml BSA) at plasma levels. Plasminogen
Was tested as a competitor. In contrast to the unrelated proteins, it prod-
uced significant inhibition (459%). Trasylol, added with the plasmino-
gen to neutralize any plasmin activity, did not eliminate the inhibitory
effect of plasminogen. In addition, the lysine analog, EACA, produced
52% inhibition of '"5I-Lp(a} binding, consistent with a contribution of
the lysine binding site(s) within Lp(a) to its interaction with these cells,
Despite the efforts to limit !°5I-Lp(a) binding dependent upon its lipo-
protein character, LDL produced significant inhibition (Table 1). At
250 nM LDL, 'I-Lp(a) binding was inhibited by 61%. When
'I-Lp(a) binding was measured in the presence of a combination of
0.2 M FACA and 250 nM LDL, 75% inhibition of binding was at-
