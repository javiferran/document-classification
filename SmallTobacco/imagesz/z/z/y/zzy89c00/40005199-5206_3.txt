sults validate our premise that the selected assay conditions effectively
suppressed ']-Lp(a) binding to either the apoB/E receptor (HDL and
acetylated LDL, which are not ligands for this receptor, were inhibi-
tory) or the scavenger receptor (LDL and HDL, which are not ligands
for this receptor, were inhibitory). Thus, the non-selective lipoprotein
binding sites (28-31, 49) must mediate the lipoprotein-dependent
component of Lp(a) binding.

Characteristics of Lp(a) Binding to Plasminogen Receptors

The time course of '?5]-Lp(a) binding to U937 cells was measured in
the presence or absence of a saturating concentration of LDL (Fig. 3).
Apparent steady state binding was achieved within 120 min. In the pre-
sence of LDL, steady state binding was also observed, indicating that
Lp(a) binding to plasminogen receptors also reached a steady state. To
ascertain whether Lp(a) binding to plasminogen receptors was more ra-
pid than total Lp(a) binding, additional experiments were conducted in
which we determined the percent of total Lp(a) binding that was inhib-
ited by EACA or LDL at 5 min intervals over the first 20 min. At these
early time points, of the total binding inhibitable by EACA + LDL,
53-60% depended upon plasminogen binding sites (inhibited by
EACA) and 40-47% on the lipoprotein binding sites. (inhibited by
LDL). Thus, the time course of Lp(a) binding to these two classes of
sites was similar. :

The following observations were made to further characterize the
interaction of !*I-Lp(a) with U937 cells: 1. The interaction was diva-
lent ion independent (Fig. 4). The extent of Lp(a) binding to U937 cells
(150 min at 37° C) was similar in the presence of 2 mM Ca or 5mM
EDTA. In parallel analyses, divalent ion availability also did not affect
'5]-LDL or "5]-plasminogen binding to the cells, 2. The interaction
of "5]-Lp(a) with U937 cells was temperature sensitive, "25.Lp(a)
binding at 4°C was reduced by 88% compared to its binding at 37° C
(Fig. 4). 'I-plasminogen and '°51-LDL binding to U937 cells also
were temperature sensitive, being reduced by 67% and 77%, respec-
tively, at the lower temperature. 3. The binding of !25I-Lp(a) to U937
cells was reversible. "I-Lp(a) was incubated with cells for 60 min at
37° C in a volume of 200 pl. At this time, one sel of samples was
diluted to 10 ml, and the second set remained undiluted, After an addi-
tional 15 min, the cells were recovered by centrifugation. Only 33% of
the Lp(a) bound to the cells in the undiluted samples was recovered
with the diluted cells. Since cell recovery in the diluted sample
exceeded 80%, the dissociation of bound Lp(a) by dilution was exten-
