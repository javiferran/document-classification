USL-Lp(a) at 10M was added ta U937 cells (4 X 10%ml) in the presence of
the indicated protein competitors. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, ovalbumin, ri-
bonuclease and plasminogen were at 1 4M; BSA at 80 mg/ml; LDL at 0.25 pM
and EACA at 0.2 M. Incubations were for 150 min at 37° C

tained, similar to the binding inhibitable by nonlabeled Lp(a) (Table 1).
The effective competitors, LDL and plasminogen, each produced dose-
dependent inhibition of !°°I-Lp(a) (Fig. 1). Neither gave complete inhi-
bition; in Fig. 1, a plateau was reached at 70% inhibition with LDL and
56% inhibition with plasminogen. EACA also gave dose-dependent
and partial inhibition. The relative inhibition of '1-Lp(a) binding by
EACA and LDL was somewhat variable during the course of these stu-
dies: in 10 experiments at a 10 nM input concentration of '5]-Lp(a), the
percent inhibition by EACA or by LDL was 55 + 18%-and 49 + 23%,
respectively. This dual, partial inhibition is consistent with two separate
components of '?5[-Lp(a) binding, one dependent upon the lipoprotein
character of Lp(a) and the second dependent upon the lysine binding
function of apa(a), these latter sites being shared with plasminogen.

To establish that the ability of Lp(a) to interact with these two clas-
ses of binding sites was not an unique property of the particular Lp(a)
isoform [the fast isoform containing apo(a) of Mr 280,000 was used],
we compared its binding to that of a slow isoform {containing apo(a)
of Mr 500,000]. Both isoforms were isolated from the same- donor
by ullracentrifugation and lysine-Sepharose chromatography. At a
10-12 nM input concentration, (150 min at 37° C), 3.3 X 10! and
6.5 X 10* molecules of the fast and slow isoform were bound per cell,
tespectively. Binding of the slow isoform was 69% inhibitable by
0.2 M EACA and 53% inhibitable by 125 j1g/ml LDL, suggesting that
this isoform also interacted with both plasminogen and lipoprotein
binding sites.

To determine whether the interaction of Lp(a) with other cells also
was inhibited by plasminogen, "*]-Lp(a) binding to HUVEC was
examined (Fig. 2). A significant component of the total binding of
"°5]-Lp(a) to these cells was inhibited by plasminogen. EACA produced
similar inhibition, suggesting that the plasminogen-sensitive interaction
depended upon the lysine binding functions of Lp(a). LDL also was
inhibitory. The combination of plasminogen and LDL was more in-
hibitory than each component separately, suggesting that HUVEC also
exhibit both plasminogen binding site-dependent and binding site-
independent (LDL -inhibitable) binding of Lp(a), In controls, !25-plas-
minogen binding was inhibited by EACA and nonlabeled plasminogen
but not by LDL. ’

To understand the basis for the lipoprotein dependent binding as
well as ways to block it so as to measure Lp(a)’s interaction with plas-
minogen binding sites exclusively, we characterized this interaction
further. Various lipoprotein particles, LDL, HDL and acetylated LDL,

were tested as inhibitors of !I-Lp(a) binding to U937 cells. In
preliminary experiments, each lipoprotein was tested in dose titration
experiments such as those shown for LDL in Fig 1, and each produced
a similar inhibition curve. The data summarized in Table 2 were obtain-
ed with a concentration of each lipoprotein particle that produced
maximal inhibition. Lp(a) binding was partially inhibited by LDL,
HDL and acetylated LDL. The extent of maximum inhibition was
similar, ranging for 43 to 51%. The combination of EACA with each
lipoprotein particle gave significantly greater inhibition than with the
lipoprotein particles alone. In controls, the lipoproteins, but not EACA,
inhibited binding of '5I-LDL to the cells (Table 2}; and EACA, but not
the lipoproteins, inhibited '?"I-plasminogen binding. These data further
support the existence of both a lysine binding site-dependent and a
lipoprotein-dependent element of Lp(a) binding. In addition, these re-
