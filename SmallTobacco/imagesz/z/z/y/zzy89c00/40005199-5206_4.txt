Fig. § Concentration dependence of '¥J-Lp(a) (Panel A) and !"5{-plasmino-
gen (Panel B) binding to cells. '5f-Lp(a) or '°I-plasminogen, were added
to U937 cells (8 X L0/ml) at the indicated concentrations and incubated for
120 min at 37° C. For both ligands, the binding isotherms were constructed in
the presence of 250 nM LDL. For !**1-Lp(a), specific binding was calculated by
subtracting counts bound in the presence of LDL + 0.2 M EACA. For
2ST_plasminogen, specific binding was calculated by subtracting counts bound
in the presence of 0.2 M EACA. Scatchard analyses of the data are shown in the
insets

sive; ie., the binding was reversible. Corroboration of this conclusion
was obtained in analyses in which 0.2 M EACA was added to cells
either simultaneously with '*5I-Lp(a) or 150 min after addition of the
radiolabeled ligand. After an additional 150 min incubation, binding
was measured in the two sets of samples. The level of 5I-Lp(a)
binding in these samples was similar (37% when EACA was added
simultaneously with the '"51-Lp(a) and 47% when the EACA was added
after 150 min), indicating complete dissociation of bound Lp(a) from
its plasminogen shared (EACA-inhibitable) binding sites.

With the demonstration that the binding of Lp(a) to the cells was sa-
turable, specific and reversible, we sought to determine the equilibrium
binding parameters of Lp(a) for the cells. Increasing concentrations of
'25]-Lp{a) were added to the cells in the presence of a high concentra-
tion of unlabeled LDL (250 nM} to restrict its interaction to plasmino-
gen receptors. Nonspecific binding was determined as counts bound in
the presence of 0.2 M EACA + LDL. Plasminogen binding isotherms
were constructed in parallel. Representative binding isotherms for
Lp(a) and plasminogen are shown in Fig 5. Because of solubility limi-
tations, high concentrations of Lp(a) could not be added. Nevertheless,
the binding isotherm for Lp(a), as well as for plasminogen, provided
evidence of approaching saturation. Scatchard plots of these data are
shown as insets in Fig.5. The data points for both Lp(a) and plasmino-
gen could be fit to a straight line, suggesting that a single affinity class
of binding sites could mediate the interaction of each ligand, The values
of Kd and B,,,, (number of binding sites) extrapolated from these cur-
ves for Lp(a) and plasminogen, respectively, were: K,= 1.0 and 1.1 pM

and 3.7 and 52 % 10° sites/cell. Thus, Lp(a) and plasminogen interacted
with their shared sites with similar affinity but Lp(a} bound to 14-fold
fewer sites. The binding parameters derived from several such experi-
ments are summarized in Table 3. The Ky values for Lp(a) (2.2 uM}
and plasminogen (2.1 .M) were similar, and the notable difference in
the B,,.. for Lp(a) and for plasminogen- Lp(a) bound to ~10-fold fewer
sites in the presence of LDL than plasminogen- was consistently
observed. This difference was substantiated throughout the course af
these studies: in 10 experiments at a 10 nM input concentration of
either '25]-Lp(a) or 'I-plasminogen, 2.3 + 0.8 X 10 and 3.4 + 1.5 X
10° molecules were bound/cell, respectively.

Nature of the Lp(a) Binding Sites on Cells

Gangliosides and cell-surface proteins with carboxy-terminal lysyl
residues have heen implicated as plasminogen binding sites on cells
(50, 51). We assessed the influence of gangliosides known to inhibit
plasminogen binding on 'J-Lp(a) binding to the cells. Individual
gangliosides (Gpjq, Gey, Gyj, and Gyy) were effective inhibitors of
"°51-Lp(a) binding to U937 cells, producing >79% inhibition at
500 .M, whereas constituents of the gangliosides (galactose, N-acetyl-
D-galactosamine, N-acetylneuraminic acid, ceramides and glucocere-
brosides) were non-inhibitory (Table 4). These results are similar to
those which we reported previously for the effects of these molecules
on plasminogen binding to cells (50). We verified that he ganglioside
preparations did not cause a general perturbation of the cell membrane
by demonstrating that they did not affect the binding of a radiolabeled
monoclonal antibody (W6/32) to the U937 cells (50). As the inhibition
of Lp(a) binding by the gangliosides exceeded 80% in some cases (see
