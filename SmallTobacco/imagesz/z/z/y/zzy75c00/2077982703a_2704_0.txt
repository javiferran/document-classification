Subject: Frosina--ABC Formula Documents

 

John:
Are you okay with this production going forward in this manner?

I will continue discussions with Joseph about the secure room and arrange for Rolf to do a survey
especially if we are agreeing to the production of Cat Il docs in Frosina. | will also work with Joseph and
Hunton on the glyphing issue. (! assume that if we go ahead with Cat |) production and we are unable to
arrange the glyphing for the production we will produce on red paper in the interim and replace the red
paper with glyped copies when they become available.
