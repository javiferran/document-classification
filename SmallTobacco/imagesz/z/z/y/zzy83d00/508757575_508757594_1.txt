‘PRESENTATION |

Although several. smoke. components...and/or. ‘metabolites. have:

been utilized these days for monitoring the. uptake of tobacco >

smoke by active and passive smokers, only the nicotine/cotinine
determination allows the distinction between no tobacco: expos-—
_ure, environmental tobacco exposure, and exposure by active

smoking (1). “However, the monitoring of nicotine/cotinine does

not reflect the uptake of biologically active tobacco= specific

nitrosamines (TSNA) . occurring. in tobacco and tobacco smoke

(slide 2). Human exposure to TSNA depends ‘not. only on their

concentrations in. tobacco. and tobacco: “smoke but: as well. on the ©

physiological conditions favoring the endogenous formation of

TSNA from alkaloids and nitrosating agents (2-7).

When analyzing physiological fluids, it was thus far not

‘possible to differentiate between inhaled. or ingested and. endo-

genously formed TSNA. Due to the limited half-life (<1 hr) of

the two. most biologically - active TSNA [N'-nitrosonornicotine

(NNN) and 4- (methylnitrosamino) - -1- -(3-pyridyl1)- 1~butanone (NK) |

traces of TSNA in physiological fluids... Recently, we have-iden-.

tified and quantitated a nicotine-derived TSNA, 4- (methylnitros-
amino)-4- ~(3-pyridyl) butyric acid (iso-NNAC) in smokeless tobacco
products and in cigarette tobacco (8). Since- iso-NNAC - occurs. in.

cigarette tobacco in relatively low concentrations, and Since
