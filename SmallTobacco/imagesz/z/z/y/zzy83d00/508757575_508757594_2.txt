1%, as we reported earlier, iso-NNAC is’ potentially a suitable

biomarker . for. the endogenous formation ~ of TSNA,: and... thus a

marker of exposure to tobacco-specific nitrosamines in active
and passive smokers..
The overall objectives of our current investigations are
(slide 3):
1. To determine the precursors of iso-NNAC by in vitro
nitrosation of tobacco alkaloids with sodium nitrite
_ under physiological conditions (pH 7, 37°C).

2. To determine a profile of TSNA, including iso-NNAC, in

tobacco and mainstream smoke of commercially available -

nonfilter cigarettes. -

3. To determine,. by spiking nonfilter cigarettes with

potential alkaloid precursors, whether and to what ex-
tent iso-NNAC. is. pyrosynthsized during. smoking.

4. To determine conditions of iso-NNAC formation during
tobacco growth and curing: by feeding tobacco plants
with 14c-labelled alkaloids.

As can be- seen inthe following figure: (slide 4), the major.

mMmeatbolic. product of nicotine is cotinine which. is,. according to.

McKennis’ and coworkers” (9),;-. in dynamic. equilibrium with: 4-(me-.

thylamino)-4-(3-pyrdiyl)butyric acid (COTAC).. In vitro nitrosa-
tion. of. both nicotine metabolites. gave rise to. iso-NNAC.. .. The
yield of iso-NNAC obtained in the reaction with cotinine was

rather low - only 0.001%. (slide 5), even in the presence of
