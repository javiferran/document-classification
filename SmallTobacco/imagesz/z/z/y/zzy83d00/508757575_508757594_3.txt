sodium thiocyanate: which was used as a catalyst. On the other

' hand, a nitrosation. of the. secondary. amine COTAC:’ was almost.

quantiative in the presence of a catalyst. However, in vitro

nitrosation of nicotine did not give rise to iso-NNAC, sugges-

ting that formation of this nitrosamino acid proceeds via coti-

nine (slide 6) rather than via 4-(methylnitrosamino)-4-(3-pyri-

dyl)butanal (NNA) as it was originally’ hypothesized. The evi-

dence that iso-NNAC - ‘can be formed from cotinine and cotinine

acid ‘opens the possibility that iso-NNAC can’ also be formed en—

dogenously from cotinine.

In order to determine whether: iso-NNAC. occurs: in. tobacco. |

smoke, and if it does, whether it originates from tobacco or is
pyrosynthesized during smoking, tobacco and the.mainstream smoke

(MS) of two commer ically available cigarettes were. assayed.

For this study we have. chosen. (slide 7) one .85. mm American. blend.

and one: 70 mm French dark tobacco nonfilter cigarette. | Ciga-
rettes were purchased > on the open market in Westchester County,
NY, in 1989. The sets of 100 cigarettes were. spiked with nico-

tine, nornicotine, cotinine, cotinine acid and. -iso-NNAC (10, 4

and 2, 2, 0.05, 0.1 -mg/cig, respectively) as described in the.

literature (10). Mainstream smoke: generation: and-collection was

completed with a Borgwaldt RM 20/CS 20-port smoking machine with

rotating head..(Heinrich Borgwaldt, Hamburg, Fed. Rep. Germany) .

using a previously described modification (11). ‘Tobacco alka-
