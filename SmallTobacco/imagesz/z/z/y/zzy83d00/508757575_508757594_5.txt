the dark tobacco cigarette (slide 11) enriched with â€˜cotinine in

comparison. with .the- control. sample: verifies: our. previous. con-

consumed by smokers and its lack of genotoxic and biological
activity add qualifying attributes to its utility as a marker of

endogenous. formation of TSNA in active and passive smokers...
