cigarette smoke were analyzed as reported earlier (8).

Data presented in the following table. (slide 8). show.that..

there is no significant difference in nicotine and the total

alkaloid. content of the two cigarettes. On: the. other hand, a.

dark tobacco cigarette. contained lower amounts, of -the minor
alkaloids except cotinine, a trend which is described in the
literature (12). However, TSNA.content of a French cigarette
tobacco was. significantly higher (slide 9), probably due to
higher pH and nitrate content of dark tobaccos (13,14). |

The results of TSNA assay in mainstream smoke showed (slide

10) that iso-NNAC’ formation: occurred only during smoking: of

"American blend cigarettes enriched with cotinine and cotinine
acid. The transfer rate of iso-NNAC from tobacco into main-
stream smoke was proven to be 1% by smoking 100 American blend
cigarettes spiked with a reference cmpound.. “Interestingly, a

doubling of nicotine in. cigarette tobacco did not result in an

increase of NNN. On the other hand, the results shown in this

' table demonstrate that a two-fold increase of nornicotine in

tobacco “resulted in 40% increase of corresponding WN'-nitros-

amine. | A latter finding, which is in disagreement: with data re-.

ported in the literature’§(T5), suggests that secondary: amine:

alkaloids are the immediate precursors of corresponding nitros-

amines, although tertiary. amine. tobacco. alkaloids. should. not be.

‘precluded as indirect precursors for TSNA.
