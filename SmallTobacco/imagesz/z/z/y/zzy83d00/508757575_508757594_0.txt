In order to determine the source of the: nicotine-derived

4-(methylnitrosamino)-4-(3-pyridyl)butyric acid (iso-NNAC) in
tobacco smoke, an American blend and one French dark tobacco

nonfilter cigarette were spiked’ -with nicotine, nornicotine,

cotinine, and iso-NNAC (10, 1, 2, and. 0.1 mg/cig., respective-
ly). Smoke generation, collection and partition were done ac-

cording to a published method. The analysis of tobacco-specific

nitrosamines. (TSNA),.nitrosamino acids (NA), and iso-NNAC in

mainstream smoke (MS) was done by gas chromatography with TEA.

detection. The U.S. blended cigarettes spiked with iso-NNAC

yielded 950 ng/cig.. of iso-NNAC in MS. (0.95% transfer), while .

formation of iso-NNAC (2 ng/cig) was observed only in the MS of
cigarettes spiked with cotinine. The latter finding suggets
that iso-NNAC may be pyrosynthesized during smoking of ciga-

‘rettes rich in cotinine. Data on iso-NNAC formation. ~rom coti-
nine in tobacco plants and in vitro’will be presented. The pos-—

sibility of using iso-NNAC as a biomarker for the exposure to
TSNA of active and passive smokers will be discussed.
