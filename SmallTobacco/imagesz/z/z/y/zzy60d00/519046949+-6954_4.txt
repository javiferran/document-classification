Placarding

The registrants strenuously object to placarding any area other than the structure
under fumigation. Why placard areas that have concentrations less than 0.1 ppm
PH,? Placarding safe areas will breed a “contempt” for the waming signs posted
in areas of genuine danger.

Fumigators are already required to notify appropriate company employees pricr to
application of the product. Perhaps this réquiremeat could be expanded to
include notiGcation of employees likely to be nearby workers. Certainly labcliag

already in place requires protection of all persons, including nearby workers.

ablish and Define ble Exposu its

Worker protection standards currently in place for phosphine fumigations are a
0.3 ppm 8-hour time-weighted average during the fumigation. and a 0.3 ppm
ceiling at any other time. Registrants would prefer to use those standards
recommended by ACGIH. We believe that OSHA uses these same standards,
These standards are a TLV/TWA of 0.3 ppm and a STEL of 1.0 ppm. There is
no scientific reason for having a separate set of standards for fumigators.

Limiting Workers Exposure

Common sense, compliance with regulations presently in place along with present
or proposed exposure limits provide adequate protection for fumigators, nearby
persons and residents.

Restriction on the Use of Phosphine In Recreational Vehicles

Registrants are unaware that phosphine fumigants are being used in recreational
vehicles. This site is not mentioned in the labeling and, thus, would be illegal.
Probably worse than the violation would be the corrosion caused by phosphine
which would likely completely destroy the vehicle. -

estri Use State t
EPA did not mention revision of the restricted use statement in the Human

Health Risk Assessment. However, the registrants request that EPA consider the
following change. The preamble to the restricted use statement reads as follows:
