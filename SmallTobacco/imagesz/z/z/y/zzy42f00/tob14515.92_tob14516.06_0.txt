CIGARETTE ADVERTISING
AND "TARGETING"

 

"It is more accurate to observe that cigarette smoking among

women led tobacco companies to advertise to the ’female

market’ than to suggest that advertising created the market in

the first place."

Prof. Michael Schudson
University of California!

Cigarette advertising is "targeted" at adult smokers. Smokers, like
consumers of other products, are not an undifferentiated mass. All sorts of people
are smokers. Cigarette manufacturers, like manufacturers in other highly competitive
markets, tailor their brand messages to those who consume their products. This is
essential to the task of distinguishing the advertised brand from the multitude of
other brands on the market.

The allegation that cigarette advertising improperly “targets” women,
minorities and "low-income groups" carries more than a little condescension. No one
ever has accused a cigarette manufacturer of improperly "targeting" white male
yuppies -- even though advertising for some cigarette brands features models who fit
that description. The assumption seems to be that women, minorities and "low-

income groups" are less capable than affluent white males to determine andact in

their own best interests and must be "protected" by government censorship.
