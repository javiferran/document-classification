percent), and was estimated to have declined further in 1987 (to 25.6 percent).!6
The 1987 estimate for blacks 20-24 years of age (25.6 percent) is significantly lower
than the 1987 estimate for whites of the same age (30.5 percent).!7 According to
the Surgeon General, this prevalence of smoking among young whites has been

Although data concerning smoking among Hispanics are less developed
than smoking among other ethnic groups, the patterns and trends in smoking among
Hispanics are inconsistent with the premise that Hispanics are "vulnerable" to
cigarette advertising. The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) has
reported that, based on several surveys, "Hispanic women tend to smoke considerably
less than Blacks or Whites, whereas Hispanic men tend to smoke at about the same

Crank has found that: "Hispanic males are as likely to smoke as anglo males; how-

anglo females seldom smoke; when they do, they smoke fewer cigarettes.""° Other
