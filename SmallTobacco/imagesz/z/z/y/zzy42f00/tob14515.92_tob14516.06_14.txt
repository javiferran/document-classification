Cookware manufacturers and food packagers have begun gearing their advertising
to male consumers.” New concern among men for their physiques also has led soft
drink makers to position their "diet" and "light" products to men as well as women?

| The manufacturer of Taster’s Choice instant coffee pulled the image of a woman off
the product’s label and replaced it with that of a man.

These data confirm that the consumption habits of men and women are

converging across the spectrum of consumer products. The consumption patterns of

women with respect to smoking are simply one instance of this general trend.

it in advertising. Advertising is not responsible for women smoking, and banning
advertising would not reduce the numbers of women smokers. Censorship cannot be

justified in the name of "protecting" women from cigarettes.
