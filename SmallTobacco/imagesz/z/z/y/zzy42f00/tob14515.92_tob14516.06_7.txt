particularly in this country. This data is consistent with the overall evidence and,
once again, supports the conclusion that advertising does not make people start
smoking or keep them from stopping. If cigarette advertising were responsible for
smoking among women, the reverse would be true.

Second, in countries where smoking among women has increased, that
increase has been part of a general disintegration of sex-based stereotypes and

consumption patterns over the past 20 years. Women and men today are purchasing

many products that used to be favored by the opposite sex. Advertisers, including
cigarette manufacturers, simply respond to these shifting consumption patterns.

If cigarette advertising and promotion were responsible for smoking
among women, one would expect to find increases in smoking among women where
advertising and promotion are permitted and decreases in smoking among women

where advertising and promotion are prohibited. The facts confound that hypothesis.

United States. Between 1965 and 1987, the incidence of smoking
among women (aged 20 years and older) declined 16 percent -- from 31.9 percent to
26.8 percent. Virtually all of that decline occurred between 1977 and 1987.* Yet,

no significant additional advertising restrictions were imposed after 1977.
