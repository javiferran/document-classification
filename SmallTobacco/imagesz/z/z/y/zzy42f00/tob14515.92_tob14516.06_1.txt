This assumption is both patronizing and demonstrably incorrect.
Commenting on the minority "targeting" issue in particular, Dr. Benjamin L. Hooks,
Executive Director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, had this to say:
"Charges have been made that [the cigarette] companies
are specifically targeting minority communities because they
offer a tempting target and are most likely to be persuaded by
the advertiser’s message than the majority community.
Implicit in this is the premise that Blacks are so naive
they will be persuaded to smoke by a billboard or an ad.
Buried in this line of thinking, and never really mentioned by
these critics, is the rationale that Blacks are not capable of
making their own free choices and need some guardian angels
to protect their best interests.
This is an insidious form of paternalism. Blacks, like the
rest of the populace, can make the choice of whether to smoke
or not."2) -
If prevalence of smoking is taken as a measure of "vulnerability" to
cigarette advertising, then black youth actually are among the least "vulnerable" in
our society. If quitting trends are taken as a measure of "resistance" to cigarette

advertising, then blacks in general are no less "resistant" than whites and black males

actually are more "resistant" than white males.
