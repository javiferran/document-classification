American high school seniors between 1976 and 1989.3 The researchers found that,
after Native American high school seniors, white seniors had the highest rates for
daily use of tobacco. Hispanic seniors had intermediate levels of tobacco use. Asian
Americans had the lowest rates, and black seniors had levels nearly as low.
Moreover, during the past decade smoking rates for whites in this group remained
essentially unchanged while rates have continued to drop among non-white groups.
The researchers suggested that these black/white differences for high school seniors
may be somewhat smaller for high school dropouts but are not basically different,
"because Black and White dropout rates are now fairly similar."
Similar data reported by the Secretary of Health and Human Services

advertising. The Secretary of Health and Human Services reported, for example, that
