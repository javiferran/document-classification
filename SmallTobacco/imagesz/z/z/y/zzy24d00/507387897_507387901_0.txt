RE: Moviegoer â€” CAMEL Perspective

As requested, the following is Media's perspective on Moviegoer Magazine relevant
to CAMEL's continued support/usage in 1987.

BACKGROUND

Moviegoer was developed in 1982 by the 13-30 Corporation for exclusive use by the
CAMEL brand. At that time, CAMEL was seeking a property that delivered impactful
impressions against better educated 18-34 year old males. Both Brand and Media
management felt that Moviegoer could deliver this audience via high levels of
frequency/exposure in selected markets. Attached is the original authorization
request submitted on May 7, 1981, which outlines key brand objectives. -

The three major objectives of Moviegoer were: 1) reach portions of CAMEL's target
not reached by other magazines, 2) generate Brand association/sponsorship ruboff
and 3) heighten awareness/impact via an uncluttered environment.

A five-year contract (1982-1986) was negotiated at a beginning cost of $5.3MM per

year. In 1983, SALEM became a co-advertiser to help offset the impact on CAMEL's

budget. Rate increases have averaged 9% per year, and in 1986, the total Corporate
commitment will be $7.4MM ($4.8MM Media, $2.6MM Promotions). Circulation has

remained controlled at 1.2MM per year.

NEW PROPOSAL

Moviegoer has offered RJR a new three-year proposal (details attached). Briefly,
the total yearly cost will be $5.6MM net (versus $7.4MM in 1985). Issues will be
decreased from 12 to 10, the number of ad pages will be decreased from 60 pages (5
pages x 12 issues) to 52 pages (5 pages x 8 issues and 6 pages x 2 issues).
Circulation will increase 46% from 1.2MM to 1.75MM in eight issues (and to 3.0MM
or 150% for 2 issues). The number of markets will decrease from 127 to 100 (212%).

CURRENT RESEARCH

During the last five years, several studies have been conducted regarding Moviegoer's

readers. For purposes of this perspective, we will summarize key research data/findings

from these studies which we feel are relevant to our CAMEL perspective. Research
data summarized are from the following sources: MDD's recent readership survey,
13-30's research and movie patron demographics/ findings from industry sources.
