QUALITATIVE OBSERVATIONS

In addition to the above research, we feel the following observations should be
included in our CAMEL perspective:

e Moviegoer's cost relative to CAMEL's magazine budget is increasing
dramatically each year. The percent of the total magazine budget
which Moviegoer represents has increased from 9% in 1984 to 21% in
1986.

@ Moviegoer was originally intended as an impressions vehicle to
supplement national coverage in high potential markets. The
current distribution pattern underdelivers in CAMEL's priority
markets. Specifically, 36% of the U.S. population resides. in the
PMSA/MWSA, but only 25% of Moviegoer's circulation falls in those
sales areas (69 Index).

® Moviegoer is very inefficient when used as a targeted younger adult

magazine:

Rolling Stone 22.55 4.39 8.23 13.78 33.97

* All CPMs reflect a single page cost of $108M (10 issues).

e The ad to edit ratio (252/75Z) is acceptable, however, we do not feel
that SALEM on the 3rd cover and CAMEL on the back cover generates the
impact and awareness we desire. Without separation, the two brands could
easily blend together and confuse the reader, and therefore, negate some of
the individual Brand differentiation.

e Awareness .

Among Moviegoer readers, the highest level of ad awareness is among
18-29 year olds, but this awareness has dropped since 1984, |

Total Awareness Decrease (1985 vs 1984)
