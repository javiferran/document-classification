that we have the freedom to review all magazines equally in order to make
‘professional decisions and to ensure that our final recommendations have a minimum
negative impact on the brand's overall impressions/continuity.

Finally, when reviewing Moviegoer's new proposal, we feel this proposal must be
evaluated equally with other publications. Moviegoer's efficiency, impressions
and coverage should meet the same criteria/requirements placed on all publications
on CAMEL's current schedule. They do not. . Moreover, RJR research does not show
that Moviegoer has met the three original objectives of reaching an audience not
reached by other magazines, building sponsorship association and heightening
awareness.

We recognize that Moviegoer (with its new modifications such as reduced price and
increased flexibility) may offer .viable promotional opportunities which the
' Promotion department may wish to explore/address. However, even after reviewing

Moviegoer's new proposal, we strongly recommend against continued support of
Moviegoer as a media vehicle for CAMEL.
