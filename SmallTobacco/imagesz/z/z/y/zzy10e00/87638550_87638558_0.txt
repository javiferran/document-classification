Abstract

An HPLC method using UV detection at 240 nm was developed for
determining ethylenethiourea (ETU) residues in tobacco. ETU
was extracted from tobacco with a solution containing methanol,
water, sodium acetate, L-cysteine, and potassium fluoride.
Interfering compounds in the tobacco extract were removed using a

trated, absorbed onto Gaschrom S, and. â€˜then added to a chromatog-
raphy column containing activated alumina. ETU was eluted from
the column with 2% methanol in methylene chloride. The eluate
was collected in a siliconized round-bottom flask, and water was
added to form a two phase mixture. This mixture was concentrated
under vacuum until the organic layer had been removed. The
remaining portion was diluted to a known volume with water and

analyzed by HPLC.

An ODS Octadecyl column 250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 U, was used for the
HPLC analysis. The mobile phase consisted of water, methanol
(96:4)..at.aflow.rate.of 1.4 mL. per minute... After each analysis,
it was necessary to wash the column for 20 minutes with methanol
at a flow rate of 2 mL per minute. ETU was monitored at 240 nm.

The recovery of ETU was greater than 80% for tobacco fortified
with 0.7 ppm ETU.
