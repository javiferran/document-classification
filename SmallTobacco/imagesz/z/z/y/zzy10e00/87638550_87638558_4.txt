Duplicate analyses were performed on Kentucky Reference 1R4F
tobacco fortified at 0.07 ppm, the detection limit of the method.
The recovery was slightly lower and ranged from 55% to 74%.

Conclusion

An HPLC method was developed for the direct determination of ETU
on tobacco. For tobacco fortified at 0.7 ppm, the average
recovery of ETU was 82.3% with a standard deviation of 6.7 for
eight determinations. The limit of detection for ETU was deter-
mined to be 0.07 ppm. Six tobacco samples of various types and
grades were analyzed for the presence of ETU. The level of ETU
in all of the tobacco samples was less than the detection limit
of this method.
