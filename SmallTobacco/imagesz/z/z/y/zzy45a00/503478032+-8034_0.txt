RE: NoW 100 FRANCHISE RISK STUDY

This reports topline results of the NOW Franchise Risk Study.

of this research were to:

1984

The objectives

e Determine NOW's franchise familiarity with the brand's tar level. In
addition, among franchise smokers who correctly playback its tar level,
measure the relative level of dissatisfaction associated with increasing
the product's tar level to 3mg even though it will deliver more taste
and retain its “lowest” positioning.

Determine why recent NOW 100 switchers “switched” to other brands.
Should the primary reason focus on poor taste delivery (e.g., not enough
taste), this would further support the case for increasing the brand's
tar level from 2 to 3mg.

A. Pranchise Smokers

Approximately 62% of NOW"s franchise were able to playback the brand's
current 2mg tar level, However, this number may be slightly inflated as
the tar level is written on the pack and respondents may have looked at it
during the interview,

Aware of Tar Level*

oh tar 5.0%
3mg tar 1.7%
4-5mg tar 3.7%
Under Img tar 9.6%
Don't know 17.9%

*Question
What is the tar level, in milligrams, of NOW 100 cigarette?

Although there is high awareness of tar content, increasing the tar level
from 2 to 3mg to provide greater taste delivery (while still being the
“lowest 100's“jappears to pose minimal risk to the brand. Only 13% of the
respondents claimed they would switch to another brand.
