CONCLUSIONS

These results suggest that there is little franchise risk assocfated with
increasing NOW 1900's tar as long as it provides Breater taste delivery and is
still perceived as the “lowest 100's” on the market.

® Relative to current 2mg product, 3mg product test results showed it to
provide greater taste delivery,

e Execution of 3mg product in advertising will be done in context of
the “lowest 100's" positioning,
