Dear Mr. Nishimura:

It was a pleasure having you visit RJR on your busy schedule
through the U.S. It was especially gratifying to have several
RJR management member's meet a long-time friend of our Company
and to engage in the helpful exchange of information on ciga-
rette manufacturing. You represented JTS very well.

During your visit, the question was asked about RJR's response
to U.S. government request for list of additives used in ciga-
rette manufacture. This is a very sensitive matter and one
which at this writing is still unresolved. However, we can
Say that the U.S. cigarette manufacturers have negotiated an
agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services
whereby the industry will disclose substances commonly added
during the cigarette manufacturing process and HHS has agreed
to treat such disclosure as CONFIDENTIAL under the Freedom of
Information Act.

I am pleased to enclose a photograph taken during our lunch
together. Standing are Mr. Ingram, Mr. Montgomery, Mr. Sisel,
Mr. Christopher, Mr. Isbister and me. And you will recognize
Mr. Stewart seated. I am sending the photo to Mr. Ishii and
Mr. Yamada also.

Best personal regards.

Sincerely,
