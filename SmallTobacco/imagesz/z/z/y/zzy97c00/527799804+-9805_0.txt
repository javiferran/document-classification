This recommends that Camel replace the Chicago East Ohio Street wall with a 52’ x 52”
wall at Ontario/State (start date 12/10) and a 20' x 20’ wall at Clark south of Addison (on
the corner of Wrigley Field, start date 11/20). The cost is $20.6M (net + commission) per
month and $246.8M for 12 months. (The cost is $23.9M for 1998 and $222.9M for
