The weights other than nicotine and water are calculated by
knowing both the dilution and the puff count of the cigarette
at FTC conditions and combining the total puff volume

(35 cc x puff count) with the molecular weight to give a
delivered weight in milligrams. These are then converted

December 4, 1980

to weight percents and Columns 7 and 8 of Table 1 show results _

for Barclay at 77% dilution, 2.4 mgm tar and 8.3 puff count.
This can be subtracted from 100%

Table 2 shows the relative rankings and values of a large
number of cigarettes on the market. It can be seen that even

the very high delivery cigarettes could be advertised as "93%
Tar Free."

An additional feature shown in Table 2 is the value and
ranking of the Barclay 85 cigarette if it were to be smoked at
25% or 40% dilution, which are closer to the dilution values
found when the Barclay is smoked by human subjects. It can be
seen that a good proportion of smokers do not attain the "99%
Tar Free" claim of the advertisement.

â€˜We would like to thank Dan Simpson for help in developing
the theoretical molecular weight and composition of the gas

stream from the cigarette.
