was prepared in KRP at 4” using a motor-
driven ground glass Potter-Elvehjem homog-
enizer. Enzyme containing supernatants
were then prepared as described above.
Again, siurage at — 20” never exceeded 2 wk.

Cell culture A 0.1 mi aliquot of suspension
of isolated cells was suspended in 2 ml of
McCoys 5A medium (&) (Grand 'sland Biv-
chemical Co., Grand Island, NY) conlainine
20% aulologous serum. This was then added
to acovershp coated with rat tail collapen
and housed in a Leighton tube. Following 4
days incubation at 37°, fresh medium was
added. The culture was terminated 4 days
later with 4% formalin and the coverslip was
Stained with toluidine blue.

England Nuclear Corp.. Boston. MA), was
added and the flask was sealed with a mulu-
ple dose rubber stopper containing a Kontes
plastic center well holding a 2.3 cm Whatman
paper scmnGllation pad. After 1 hr 53 min of
incubation at 37”, 0.2 ml of 1.0 Af hydroxide
of Hyamine in methanol (New England Nu-
cleat) was injected into the center well. and 5
min later the reaction was stopped by addi-
tion of 1.0 ml of 1.0 V perchloric acid into
the incubation solution The flasks were then
shaken for 45 min at room temperature for
trapping evolved “CO. Finally the center
wells wer: added to scintillation vials con-
taining 15 ml of toluene scintillation fluora-
phor and the radioactivity counted in a Uni-
lus 11 scintillation spectrometer (Nuclear

Results, Figure 1 is a phase photomicro-
Eraph (O80) of cells present in the pooled
suspension obtained follawing the described
trypsin treatment. While occasional red cells

fracments are present. it is clearl. evident
