Fic 2 Endothelial cells cultured on rat tail collagen following isolation by luminal enzymatic trpstuar :

(phase, 252 X).

sion are endothelial cells (EC).

The appearance of this suspension foltow-
ing 8 days of culture is shown in Fig. 2
Inspection of this photomicrograph indicates
2 cell populations: fibrophilic endothelial
cells (EC;). and atherophilic endothelial
cells (EC,) characterized by the presence of
Prominent vacuoles. On a relative scale. 30%
of the culture population had the appearance
of atherophilic endothelium and 705¢ fibro-
philic endothelium The appearance of these
cells following § days of culture clearly indi-
Cales the trypsin treatment yielded viabh
¢ ndothelium.

The HFC of both isolated endothelial cells
and their paired intima-media homogenates
is given in Table 1. Each value is the mean of
duplicate HFC determinations for cell sus-
pensions or intima-media Preparations from a
fiven animal: Rroup means. together with
their respective standard errors, are given at
the bottom of the table. These show an
endothelial HFC of 4371 + 506 dpm/mg
protein and an intima-media HFC of 314 +
46 dpm me protein Variance analysis fol-
lowed by Tukey's Least Siznificant. Differ.
ence test (10) indicates this difference js
highly signihcam (p < 01),

Jotialy additional HFC determinations
were also performed on the pellet fraction of

the homogenate obtained following ceuriiy
fation. Since the acuivily of the pellet frat
tion was in all cases not significanuly diflean
from background activity, the extuctre
method employed for this enzyme was ech
tially complete and confrmee work of other
(7.9, 11,12).

Discussion. The morphological and fun
tional! characteristics of arterial endothtlium
are similar to those of continuous-type cpl
laries (14. 15) Similarly, arterial enduhil,
um occupies a key role in the regulation of
