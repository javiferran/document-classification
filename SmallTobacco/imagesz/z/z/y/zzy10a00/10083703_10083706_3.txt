arterial wall permeability similar ta the rale

lary sphincters in the microurculation Thus.
it is reasonable to assume that the BHD ae-
tivity of large artery endothelium should be
<imilar to that of endothehum in the micra-
circulation. The results of this investization
clearly show that under these in vilro asst}
conditions the HD activity of bovine aortic
endothelium is appronimately 15> grezter
than that of subjacent intima-media.

1. is obvious that the HFC of both the
pooled rell suspension and the intima-media
reflerts the sum of individual HD activities
of the various celts found within these Iwo
fractions. Histological studies of untnpsi-
nized tissue employing either theonine or neu-
tral red countersianed with hematoxylin
showed a few granulated mast cells within
the adventitia. None are seen following the
adventitial stripping procedure employed
prior to trypsinization. Thus, the HFC of the
pooled ell suspension is a reasonably quan-
titative measurement of the HD activity of
the endothelium. while that of subjacent inti-
ma-media reflects the HD activity of smooth
muscle

To determine whether trypsin treatment
itelf might contribute tc the difference in
cberved HD activity between wall com-
ponents, the HFC of rectangular specimens
of intima-media devoid of endothelium and
washed with trypsin-KRP solution were also
determined. No significant difference in HFC
was noted between Urypsin-treated and con-
ot intima-media preparations In addition
the trypsin (reatment {failed to produce mast
cell degranu‘ation in those few cells located
al the adventitial-medial junction. While
tnpsin, like dextran. is a potent mast cell
histamine releasing agent, the lack of its

tan undoubted!s be explained by lack of
trypsin diffusion into the inner wall. This is
not surprising in view of the relatively short
lime the tissue was exporcd lo the trypsin
wlution. In addition. trypsinizatien ditt not

tween the endothehum and untima-media
This lack of urypsir effect. as well 25 that of
dextran and other histamine releasing ayents
un histamine synthesis, has been previously
demonstrated (1).

The results of the present investigation
give. to our knowledge, the first experimental
verification of Schayer’s remise that the
endothelium is the major site of histamine

synthesis within the vascular_system under

escenually physiological conditions.
“Summary. The HFC of bovine aortic en-

dothelial ceils was compared to that of sub-
jacent intima -media homogenates. Results in-
dicated that endothelial HEC. and thus the
endothelial histidine decarboxylase system,
was approximately 15 greater than that of
the intima-media.
