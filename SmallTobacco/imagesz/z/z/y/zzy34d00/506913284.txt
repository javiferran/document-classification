Hearing Clerk's Office, Docket No. 77P-0185
Food and Drug Administration

Room 4-65, 5600 Fishers Lane

Rockville, Md. 20857

Dear Sirs:

This is to advise you that I strongly support
the immediate, strict regulation by the Food and Drug
Administration of all cigarettes containing nicotine,
in accordance with the petition filed with you by
Action on Smoking and Health.

There is an overwhelming amount of evidence
that cigarettes containing nicotine fall clearly within
the definition of "drugs" which "are articles intended
to affect the function of the body of man." In addition,
the evidence against such cigarettes as a dangerous health
hazard, both to the smokers themselves and to non-smokers
unavoidably exposed to a smoky environment, is overwhelming -
far stronger, in fact, than any evidence yet revealed
against saccharin, which is already acknowledged to be
under your jurisdiction and concerning which you have
already taken definitive action.

Your prompt regulation of cigarettes containing
nicotine can be a giant step toward saving untold numbers of
U.S. residents, now living and as yet unborn, from illness
and premature death due to lung cancer, heart disease
and other human ailments already linked to cigarette

smoking.
