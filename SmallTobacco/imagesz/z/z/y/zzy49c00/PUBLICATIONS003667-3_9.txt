previvusly published reports. In meeting the needs for restorative treatment shown in
Table 6, the costs would be in excess of the mean numbers of surfaces requiring
treatment multiplied by the cost of treating a surface. Many of the surfaces requuing
restoration are proximal surfaces and two surface restorations (and cost) are involved.

Prior experience with the analysis of dental caries data has facilitated detailed analyses.
One of the goals of the project 1s 10 examine and evaluate scores of parameters reiating to
periodontal disease in order to make their interpretation as meaningful as the present day
interpretation of dental caries information. To that end, scores relaing to periodontal
disease will be analyzed by appropriate multivariate procedures in an attempt to develop
a new index of periodontal disease. Hopefully, this index will be more sensitive than
available measures. This index will ultimately be combined with the components of the
D.M.F. index plus evaluations of prosthetic replacements in order to develop an index of
total oral health.

‘Asin the case of dental caries described above, the universality of periodontal disease is
demonstrated. No 5, was completely free of all of the components of periodontal disease.
Only two Ss had mouths that were completely free of calculus, a significant irritant to the
pingival tissues. Only two Ss failed to demonstrate at least one penodontal pocket
present.

The mean periodontal scores are shown in Table 7 along with the percentages of
subjects with positive evidence of the finding noted. Far greater variability is observed in
analyses of periodontal status thin in D.M.F. analyses due to the larger number of
