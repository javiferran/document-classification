(9) Past caries experience and restorative treatment, the incidence of new caries on

sound and previously restored tooth surfaces.

(10) The apparent need for prosthetic replacements, their provision and their appraisal
of prosthetic replacements in terms of cost, prevalence, Jongevity, guality and function.

Although certain factors in this list appear to be quite simple and basic, little or no
objective information is available to quantitate them. Until these data are available, it is
difficult to establish a measure of total dental health and determine progress in the
delivery of dental health services. The findings of this study will also be valuable in
providing information relevant to the problems encountered in extended programs of the

delivery of health services 10 veterans and other large groups.
