individual components of D.M.F. counts on a nationwide basis. The data from the
Nations] Heath Survey include edentulous subjects in the published values for the
componenis of the D.M.F. counts, that is, mean decayed, mean missing and mean filled
teeth. Jnspection of the data in Table 5 makes it clear that veterans from New England
have similar iotal D.M.F. counts when all edentulous subjects are included. However,
marked differences are present in the three components. In the New England veterans,
the counis of decayed teeth are consistently higher than for all U.S. males. As in the case
of all U.S. males, mean counts of decayed teeth decrease with advancing age. The mean
counts of filled teeth are also higher in all age groups for veterans im New England.
However, as in the case of mean counts of decayed teeth, mean counts of filled teeth for
both groups decrease with increasmg age. Mcan counts of missing teeth for New England
veteians are consistently Jower than those of all U.S. males. The higher caries experience
of New Englanders in general is well known. However, the higher mean counts of filled
teeth, in the light of concomitantly lower counts of missing teeth suggest that these
veierans may have been exposed to higher Icvcls of dental care. This perhaps is the result
of dental trcatment provided during theis service in the Armed Forces and programs of
the Veterans Administration associated with World War J and the Korean conflict,

Mean counts of decayed tooth surfaces are shown in Table 6 according to age. Mean
numbers of decayed surfaces are shown on surfaces without prior restorations (first
column), on surfaces with prior restorations (second column), and for all surfaces (third
column). it is obvious that in all age groups the need for restorative dentistry continues to
be a real problem. Furthermore, more than half of the decayed surfaces exist on tooth
Surfaces that were restored (at least once) before. This finding is consistent with
