About 65 percent of the Ss reported that they did not use tobacco. Some 8 percent of
the cigarette smokers use more than one pack per day. Cigar and pipe smokers
constituted only 16 percent of the total sample. In the next sezies of cross-tabulations
prepared, the oral health of users and non-users will be compared.

Only 16 percent of the study population stated that they Inad not received dental
treatment since joining the parent study. At first this may seein like a high level of dental
care, in comparison to the findings of the U.S. National Health: Survey, but it must be
kept in mind that Ss have been in the parent study from 1-7 years and past dental service
has accumulated. The details of the ty pe of dental treatment teceived are noteworthy.

Although the age of the group is the One in which periodontal disease is a major problem,
only 6 percent stated that they received periodontal services. Examination of subsequent
data indicates that only iwo Ss with teeth were free of calculus and two Ss without at
Jeast one periodontal pocket. These findings sugyest the allleged “old fashioned”,
“mechanistic” types of dental practice have not been replaced 10 any great extent by
modern biologic concepts.

Enquiries related to toothbrushing habits suggest that toothbrushing before breakfast
and before bed is far more common than brushing after eating. The latter procedure is
much more effective for plaque removal and protection of tiue teeth and periodontal
structure. Futhermore, upward of half of the Ss reported that their present toothbrush
was about 6 months old. While a third of the Ss used auxiliary hygiene devices such as
toothpicks and dental floss, 47 percent stated that they used mouthwash. These findings
in an adult group attest more to the power of television adwertising than to effective
preventive dentistry. As might be expected, Crest and Colgate toothpastes accounted for
58 percent of all toothpaste users, consistent with maiketing reports,
