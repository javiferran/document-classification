components of periodontal disease. Furthermore, periodontal disease becomes well
established only later in Jife and the sample size evaluated here is relatively small when
individual age brackets are considered. Analysis of the available data illustrates this
iricrease in severity associated with age. Mean scores for alveolar bone loss advance
steadily (0.24-0.83) with the 25-34 to 65:74 age groups. However, mean scores for
hygiene, calculus, gingivitis, mobility and pockets are quite similas in all age groups (Table
7). Analyses of longitudinal data will ultimately provide reliable information on reasons
for tooth loss. As distussed earlier and shown in Table 5, mean counts of missing teeth
increase with increasing age. However, it is the mean counts of filled teeth and decayed
testh which decrease markedly. In other words, with advancing age, those teeth which
have had prior restorative experience are extracted rather than the sound teeth. While
posterior teeth are more Lable 10 be decayed and filled, there is no reason to expect them
to be more susceptible 10 periodontal disease than anterior teeth. Some complex
aigociation is involved here and is difficult to discern at this point. The possibility of
some iatrogenic effect must be considered. Additional computer programming and
analyses of the effects of variables such as overhanging fillings, food impaction and the
iiteraction of different variables are in progress to help elucidate this problem. In
addition, the individual parameters shown in Table 7 will be examined collectively and
different weightings applied in order to evaluate their relative significance in periodcntal
disease as well as to develop a mote sensitive index of periodontal discase.
