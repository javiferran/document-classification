Recommended Programs (Continued)

A. Core Brand Defense (Continued)

2. Carton Insert Program (Continued)

The carton insert will also provide a toll-free number

for franchise smokers to use to participate ina
bounceback offer of six $1.00 carton coupons. The

program is therefore designed to be self-selecting, or

targeted to price-sensitive franchise smokers.

The core brands account for approximately 14MM
smokers. Assuming that 50% of these smokers are
reached through the insert program and that 30% of
these respond, 2.1MM franchise smokers will
participate in the rebate program. Assuming 50% of
coupons are redeemed, 1.3 billion units of volume are

protected.

The total cost of the program is estimated to be

$10.1MM.

- Reply Card/bounceback booklet/postage $ .9MM

- 1-800 charges 2.1MM

~ Redemption 7.1MM
Total $10.1MM

The program should commence in Manufacturing in mid-July
in order for insert product to be available at retail in
the August-September period. The decision date on
inserts would be early June.

B. Savings Segment Program

To capitalize on switching volume resulting from an FET
increase, the following aggressive Savings Segment
support is recommended:

1. Accelerated national introduction of MS, to July Ly
1087. â€˜This timing will allow MS to establish retail
distribution and generate consumer awareness prior to
an October tax increase. A go/no go decision will be
made mid-April when results of the total proposition
test are available. 1987 marketing expenses are
estimated to be $45MM. Total 1987 volume contribution
is projected to be 2.1 billion units, of which 1.6
billion is incremental.

2. National expansion of DORAL ULT 100's July 1,,1987. A
July expansion of DORAL ULT 100's is projected to
generate incremental volume of 191MM units in 1987
with marketing expenses of $700MM. Decision date for
a July DTS is mid-April.
