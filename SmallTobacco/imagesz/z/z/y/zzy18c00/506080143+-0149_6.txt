Summary

The recommended program assumes an FET increase effective
October 1, 1987. While the core defense and DORAL/CENTURY
programs could be accelerated to accommodate a July tax
increase, timing on MS is fairly inflexible. The total
program (ex. carton insert core defense program) would,
however, be effective with timing adjustments for a July
excise increase as well as an October increase.

Other Considerations

It should be noted that the base excise tax increase volume
forecast inherently assumes that defensive programs will be
utilized on established brands and that RJR will achieve a
35% share of the Savings Segment on DORAL and CENTURY.
Hence, additional revenue has not been assigned to the
programs behind these brands as it is included in the
forecast.

In addition, whether or not a FET increase is legislated in
1987 or not, pricing pressures will continue to mount with
local/state excise tax and manufacturer's price increase
activity. Therefore, development of half-cartons and
smaller size packs, which should appeal to younger adult and
minority smokers, will continue to be aggressively pursued
for testing. These programs are not recommended as a
response to the 1987 excise due to the lead times involved.
