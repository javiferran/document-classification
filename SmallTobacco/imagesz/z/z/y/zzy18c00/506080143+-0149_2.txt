IV. Recommended Programs (Continued)

A. Core Brand Defense (Continued)

- inform franchise smokers of the potential tax increase
and ask them to write in opposition to their
representatives in Washington; and,

- offer a tax rebate/coupon program, contingent upon the
tax increase, which will defray the retail price
increase in the short term.

These programs will, therefore, initiate a grass roots
effort to fight the increase and protect our most
price-sensitive core brand smokers if an increase occurs.

1. July On-Carton Program Expansion

The current July on-carton program consists of 4.8MM
$2.00 on-carton coupons on core brand styles. It is
recommended that this program be expanded by an
additional 1.2MM coupons and modified to include the
following FET defense feature:

- Postage paid business reply card provided on (or
in) carton for smokers to voice their opposition to
a FET increase to appropriate parties in Congress.

- 1-800 number for smokers to call for additional tax
protection if an increase does in fact occur.
Contingent upon an increase, six $1.00 carton
coupons will be mailed back to consumers. Total
volume protected by this program is 1.1 billion
units. (This assumes a 30% response rate and 50%
of coupons redeemed).

Total incremental program cost is estimated to be

$11.3MM.
- 1,2MM incremental on-carton coupons $ 2.5MM
- = Reply card/bounceback booklet/postage 1.0MM
- 1-800 charges 1,.8MM
- Redemption 6.0MM
Total $11.3MM

2. Third Quarter Carton Insert Program

A carton insert will be placed in two weeks production
of all key core brand styles to create smoker
awareness of the potential FET increase. A postage
paid business reply card will be included to
facilitate smoker response to Washington.
