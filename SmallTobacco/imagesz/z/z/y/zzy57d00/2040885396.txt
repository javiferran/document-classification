Marlboro Promotion Programs Qualitative Report

Attached Is the moderator's report on the recently conducted series of focus groups on
Marlboro promotion ideas developed by Young & Rubicam. Key findings include:

» "Marlboro Country" offers opportunities to broaden and contemporize ihe brand's
image through connections to both environmentalism and adventure.

* The concept of “The Mariboro Foundation" which would purchase open jand for
preservation offered particularly strong imagery and made consumers feel good about
choosing Marlboro. However, there was also considerable cynicism as to the company's
motives which made any retail tie-in suspect.

* The "Marlboro Adventure Team" concept (as executed by Y&R) offered greater
potential for promotional programs but was more limited in its imagery. While some
men relished the idea of an all out adventure in Marlboro Country, most were somewhat

intimidated. They would prefer weekend hiking or fishing trips rather than more
strenuous “Adventures.”

« Some of the later groups combined the ideas and were excited by the concept of a
Marlboro Environmental SWAT Team that would perform "heroic" clean-ups and
respond to natural disasters such as Hurricane Andrew. There appeared to be strong

appeal to the idea of modern-day Marlboro Men publicly performing strenuous “good
deeds."
