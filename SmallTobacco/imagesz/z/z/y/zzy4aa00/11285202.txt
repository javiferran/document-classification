Dear Dr. Little:

I am sure you are aware of the advertisement placed in Monday's
Wall Street Journal by the "Topacca Institute", which quotes
you extensively, Although, I am sure your remarks are quite
valid within a proper context, their appearance in such an
advertisement can only mislead and confuse,

Whether or no there be a demonstrated causal relationship
between smoking and any disease, the statistical evidence
is overwhelming that smoking is harmful, Any ex=smoker will
also testify to a general improvement in his health upon
stopping smoking.

I find that I dare not smoke a single cigarette lest I fall

victim once again to the habit. When I was a heavy smoker

(23 packs a day) 1 found I did enjoy a few cigarettes Occasionally,
Most cigarettes I smoked however because of the habit

It would seem to me that the most fruitful avenue for tobacco=
related research would be in the field of addiction. If you
could identify the addicting agents and remove them from
tobacco smoke, you might make it possible for a person like

me to enjoy an occasional cigarette without fear of addiction,

In any event there are any number of thing the tobacco industry

could do that would be batter than denying what is well known.
Propaganda is not an adequate substitute for knowledge.
