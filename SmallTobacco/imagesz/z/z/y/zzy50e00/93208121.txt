MEMORANDUM

May 16, 1994

TO: Mr. R. H. Orcutt

FROM: R. B. Spell .

 

The attached two pages reflect the number of retail outlets
participating in our P.A.P. Program and the expenditures against
Harley and Style during March and April.

Please note: Monies reflect quantity of product bought down, not
sold through. I can not determine movement or
growth until the number of outlets being added
stabilizes.

These monies do not reflect added expenditure. Each dollar spent
toward P.A.P. must have an equal value of coupons/stickers removed
from allotment and held in division offices.

R. B. Spell
