e PRESSURE ZONING FOR SMOKING AREAS

Indoor environments may also effectively deal with indoor smoking using pressure
zoning. The technique of “air pressure zoning” has been described in a recent publication for design

engineers:

Air generally flows from areas of higher air pressure to areas of lower air
pressure, from positive pressure in the direction of negative pressure. Using
this simple concept, areas set aside for nonsmokers can be maintained at a
slight negative relative air pressure, This will produce a slight airflow from
the nonsmoking area into the smoking area, keeping the air from the smoking
area. Through thoughtful planning and carefully supervised and tested
balancing of the HVAC system, the preferences of both smokers and
nonsmokers can be accommodated without any additional cost to building

operations.
Thus, negative pressurization can be achieved by separate exhaust to the outdoors or
by simple adjustment of volumes of supply and exhaust air.

E. Sterling and Collett have reported on the effect of negative pressurization upon
levels of ETS in offices. The data indicate that, under conditions of minimal recirculation and
negative pressurization, “ETS was not detected in the adfacent non-smoking areas.” The
researchers concluded that “negative pressurization is equally effective in virtually eliminating
nonsmokers’ exposure to ETS under different workplace smoking configurations, such as

designated lounges or division of the workplace into smoking and non-smoking offices.”

Pressure-zoning and negative pressurization are feasible options for dealing with
workplace smoking using existing exhaust and supply air locations in a building, without
physical barrier supplementation or direct exhaust to the outdoors. Proper pressure-zoning
will virtually eliminate “drift” of tobacco smoke into nonsmoking areas, thereby minimizing

to a great degree nonsmoker exposure to ETs:!
