e SEPARATELY VENTILATED, SEPARATELY EXHAUSTED SMOKING ROOMS
[THE U.S. EPA APPROACH]

The U.S. EPA and other federal agencies advocate a regulatory approach that
mandates separately ventilated and separately exhausted smoking rooms operated at negative
pressure. We oppose this approach as a mandatory regulatory strategy in part because:

. One-size-does-not-fit-all;

. The approach ignores options already successfully used by business;

, It is cost prohibitive when applied across the board;

. It is technologically infeasible in many instances; and

. It is not supported by the science.

Although separately ventilated smoking rooms should not provide the basis for
mandatory regulation, separately ventilated rooms may be the preferred choice for some businesses.
24510 As long as the separate smoking room is an optional choice for those businesses that can
withstand the costs it can be considered as a part of the overall, comprehensive approach to indoor

smoking. [For reference see the Materials Volume at Tab No. 12. Fora discussion of the OSHA
version of the EPA approach see the Materials Volume at Tab No. 10.]
