« SMOKING GUIDELINES, SMOKING POLICIES AND ACCOMMODATION
PROGRAMS UTILIZING ADEQUATE VENTILATION

Smoking guidelines, smoking policies and accommodation can offer methods (i) to

address the interests of smokers and nonsmokers, (ii) to reduce nonsmoker exposure to ETS -» the

extent depending upon the type of policy or accommodation that is implemented, all (iii) at little or

no additional cost.!

Because most of all U.S. businesses have smoking policies, federal regulation that
encourages the use of individualized policies should be heipful to business, Such flexibility will also
allow employees and employers to interact in a meaningful way on these issues to craft the best
possible solution for their work environment, [For reference, see Materials Volume at Tab No. 2,

and Tab No. 3,]

e SEPARATION OF SMOKERS AND NONSMOKERS, SHARING A COMMON
VENTILATION SYSTEM

Simple spatial separation of smokers and nonsmokers in the workplace has a
profound effect upon nonsmoker exposure to ETS, Depending upon the configuration of individual
workplaces, exposures of nonsmokers to ETS constituents Teportedly have been reduced
dramatically ~ in some instances, to levels at or below the limits of detection or quantitation for air
monitoring devices. Further, simple spatial separation of smokers and nonsmokers has proven
effective in minimizing nonsmoker exposure to ETS in a variety of settings under various existing
HVAC configurations, including those that provide recirculated air, existing exhausts, pressure-
zoning and/or local filtration. In short, simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers

significantly reduces nonsmoker exposure to ETS, at little or no additional cost.
