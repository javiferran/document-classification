The Honorable Michael Bilirakis, Chairman
Commerce Subcommittee on Health & Environment
U.S. House of Representatives

Washington, D.C.

Dear Honorable Bilirakis:

The California Beverage Merchants Association, representing over 3,000 mom
and pop liquor and convenience store owners in California, has been pleased to
promote the We Card program to itâ€™s members for over a year. We have
publicized the program through our newsletters, distributed materials in our
membership kits, and championed the We Card Kits at membership meetings.

We believe that this program is an important tool for our members to use in
training their staff in responsible retailing, and have had very positive feedback
from them.

As a member of the Coalition for Responsible Tobacco Retailing, we have
helped to set up and promote training for members and non-members alike,
including planning an aggressive program of training for California retailers in
April, May and June of this year.

We Card has significantly helped our members and their employees in lowering
the incidents of sales to minors, and we are pleased to be a part of this important

effort.

Sincerely,

 

Judith L. Ashley
Executive Director
