OREGON:
- Eugene, OR: meetings held with Mark W. Perrin, atty.;
re: sampling ordinance. Perrin has meeting scheduled with
city Atty for 5/5/86.

Attempts to re-generate coalition formed several years
ago, during Eugene public smoking ordinance debates, not
meeting with success. Local vendors not supportive of
sampling programs; restaurateurs don't want sampling; not
yet getting sympathetic response from C of C.

WASHINGTON: ~
- Contacted David Figuracion; Tacoma, WA; re: press
reports about his potential suit challenging SB 4519. He
was working with an attorney on a "volunteer" basis, but
now that he finds he has to actually file suit challenging
emergency clause vs filing of referendum, atty is not
available (atty works in County Prosecutor's office).
Told him, as instructed, that we could have our attorney's
share research on SB 4519 with his attorney(s). He has
spoken with several people who have expressed support;
they will probably help him raise $70 filing fee; he'll
explore finding an attorney and get back to us. He has
own computer software firm he operates from his home-not
unusual in Puget Sound area.
