Subject: FW: FCTC Meeting in DC May 14

One of the attendees this morning at the meeting described below was Rosemarie Henson, the new Director of the
Office on Smoking and Health. Following our general meeting, having heard our positions on many of the issues, she
approached me and said that she would love to meet with our team that could give her details on our positions and
product work relating to:

She

protocols for assessing cigarette ingredients
benchmarking of smoke constituents
assessing reduced risk products

legislation providing for FDA regulation

seemed surprised at many of the positions that we have long taken.

Does it make sense to convene a discussion of how we might best follow up on this contact?
