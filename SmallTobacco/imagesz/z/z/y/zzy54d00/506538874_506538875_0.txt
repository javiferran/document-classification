SUBJECT: The Archer Company -
of January 25, 1988

eekly Activity Report for Week

1. Genesis Packaging - TAC's peelable retortable lidding structure is
the material of choice at Genesis, who requested 3MM square inches
for further machine evaluations. Genesis has sold two machines for
applying our flexible membranes to their plastic barrier containers
and retorting products to replace metal cans. One machine is at
National Food Laboratories; the other machine's location is
confidential. Genesis and TAC management will meet during the
second quarter to coordinate efforts geared for production
quantities early 1989,

2. Polaroid - A management/technical team from Polaroid is visiting
TAC 1/26-27/88 to review the technical issues on modifying their
structure for one mil pod foil to enable TAC to receive a 500%
permanent increase in business. One mil pod is presently produced
on a unique multi-faustel laminator that is already at capacity and
Polaroid desires to have the new structure approved by 10/1/88.
Both companies are working to make the opportunity happen.

3. Campbell (Plastigon Program - Retortable Soups) - TAC's lidding
material (utilizing a proprietary sealant film produced on the
oriented film line at the pilot plant) has just passed U.S.D.A.
protocol testing. Material to be tested at their Maxton, NC plant
this week. The Plastigon program will leapfrog Campbell into new
technology and markets.

4. Miles Laboratories - After three price negotiation sessions, we
have still not resolved our 1/1/88 price. Our cost increases
justified a price increase proposal of 7.75%. Miles countered with
an offer of 2.0%. We have countered with a 5.5% price increase for
S4MM of business and a 5.0% increase for $5MM of business. We
expect to settle on the latter and and finalize this agreement by
1/29/88.

5. Converter Foil Pricing ~ Alcoa has announced a price increase of 6%
to be effective on all new orders and on existing orders shipped
after 4/18/88. We will support this increase and advise our
customers that our prices have increased by 6% effective on and
after 4/18/88. This action will also precipitate a general price
increase on our foil-bearing converted products, and TAC Marketing
will determine the level and timing of this increase.

6. TAC's Northeast Sales office has relocated from Long Island to

Wilton, Connecticut. Ralph Klein, Sales Manager, expects to have a
secretary hired the week of 2/2/88.
