Implantation and Uterine Function in the Rat.

Considerable evidence indicates that nicotine adversely affects
pregnancy in the rat. Among such disruptive effects are increased frequency of
fetal resorption, reduced litter size and weight, and delayed parturition. The
primary objective of the experiments embodied in this study is to gain a greater
understanding of the means by which nicotine exerts disruptive effects on the
normal course of pregnancy, and more particularly, how the chief alkaloid of tobacco
reduces litter size and delays parturition. To this end, a variety of parameters
will be measured to assess reproductive efficiency, time of implantation, fetal
growth and development, and normalcy of parturition in nicotine-treated vs.
control rats.

Severa] experimentally testable hypotheses are proposed. Specifically,
experiments will be conducted to determine if nicotine-induced reduction in litter
size and delay in parturition are related to alterations in uterine sensitivity
to implantation. The time of onset, magnitude and duration of sensitivity to
decidualization will be compared in treated and control rats. In addition, the
effects of nicotine on duration of gestation will be determined by an accurate
measurement of the time of parturition.

Recent experiments have demonstrated that both the development of the
preimplantation blastocyst and the time of zona pellucida loss are delayed in
nicotine-treated rats. Experiments are in progress to assess: (1) the magnitude
of the delay, (2) the hormonal conditions under which it occurs, and (3) various
aspects of the intrauterine environment.
