Dear Mark:

As a follow-up to Les Richter’s letter of March 19, 1990 regarding
The Winston, we would like to advise you of details of this event below:

Winston Tea arbe

On Friday, May 18, we have planned an informal barbecue to be held in the
Winston Cup giant tent adjacent to the garage area. Please feel free to stop
by with the members of the Folgers team immediately following Sportsman
qualifying.

e Winston Driver Sweepsta - Saturd Ma 9

As an alternative to the Autograph session last year, we are planning a
sweepstakes where the fans can win a nice prize which will be drawn by you.
Humpy’s boxing ring will be set-up at the start/finish line all day and you
will be escorted to the stage at 5:00 p.m. by the Winston Cup Team (see
attached schedule and list of prizes) to draw for the Brass Bed.

Pre-race - Sunday, May 20

So you will not be surprised by the pre-race show we have planned for The
Winston, the stage will consist of a large (5' x 7') drawing of you facing the
fans in the grandstand. You will be lined up according to your qualifying
order behind the stage. When the MC introduces you, simply step through the
paper photo of yourself onto the stage and then through the drill team and
honor guard to your race car.

Since the inception of The Winston in 1985 we have continually strived to
build this event into the world’s premier winners-only event. Your support of
this event is greatly appreciated and good luck to the Folgers team!

Sincerely,

Rick Hauser
