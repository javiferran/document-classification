Attorneys General Proposed Settlement

Earlier today you received Geoff Bible’s desk drop on the proposed settlement with
the state attorneys general. I want to take this opportunity to reiterate that this is
just the beginning of the process and until we know that the requisite number of
states agree to participate, it is premature for us to discuss any of the implications of

this agreement.

l intend to address all PM USA employees early in December with my “state of the
union” message. At that time, I think we should have some insights as to what this
agreement represents for our business and our plans as we go forward; and as a

result, I will be prepared to go into much more detail with each of you.

As Geoff indicated, we are all very appreciative of your ongoing support in this

matter,
