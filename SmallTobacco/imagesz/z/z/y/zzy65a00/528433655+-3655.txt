Problems

Most of this week has been dedicated to find a solution to an EMM386 error that’s
occurring on several PC machines, mostly in the Training Room. I talked to a Microsoft
engineer about this problem in great detail. He tells me the Upper Memory Blocks on the PC
machines are incorrectly mapped by PC applications. He instructed me how to exclude regions
of memory from being mapped. However, it did not solve the problem. I will continue to bug
Microsoft.

Also, last Wednesday, a problem with the network was being affected throughout the
building. I and several users were hit with dropped connections or Microsoft Mail errors. I
didn’t think to look at our sniffer to see if there was anything loading the system. If it happens
again, I'll investigate the sniffer.

Opportunities

Most of the Statisticians group and myself met to discuss SAS. I demonstrated how to
connect and install the server application. With the exception of Mike Morton trying to print his
data, most are ready to evaluate the SAS application.

Mary Ann and I helped Patrice Sigmon with her Workgroups classes.
