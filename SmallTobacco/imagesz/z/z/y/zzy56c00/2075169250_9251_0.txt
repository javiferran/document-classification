Inter-office Memorandum

   

    
 

TO: Liz Chambers Sept. 9, 1997
FROM: Richard Jupe
SUBJECT: Salem Pianissimo - Japan

At your request, the following information has been compiled in reference to the filter systems used for
the Salem Pianissimo 100’s (2 mg) and Salem Pianissimo Lights 100’s (6 mg) products produced by RJ
Reynolds for the Japanese market. Although the product claims low side stream, there is nothing too
unique concerning the filter systems for either of these products.

As the attached PTL data indicate, the filters for both products are conventional mono-acetate plugs. Both
- products use one row of Hauni on-line ventilation (20 holes per row) to achieve the ventilation levels for
the products. The measured ventilation levels used to achieve the tar values, are comparable to the levels
used by numerous products to meet those tar deliveries. It would appear that the high level of ventilation
and the level of expanded tobacco are the mechanisms used to acquire a low tar delivery for the 2 mg

product.
