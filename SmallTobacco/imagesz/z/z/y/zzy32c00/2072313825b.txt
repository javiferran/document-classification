Even,

Don't be horrified. When there is too much to do, it is impossible to remember everything. Yesterday,
Karsten Schmidt took the position, prompted by Helmut Reif, that to meet with the German Minister of
Health with a publication already in hand would be counter productive. This position carried the day.
Therefore, the document will not be published. | think that | can speak for all of the scientists who were
involved, even marginally, in this effort that this decision is consistent with our position. Now we can go
on to the next step.

Best regards.

Ted
