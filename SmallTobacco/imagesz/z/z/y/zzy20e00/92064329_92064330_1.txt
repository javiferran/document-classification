85 NM vs. 100 MM Smokers +

 

The 85 MM smokers were far more critical in their evaluation
for Harley Lts. 100 MM than were 100 MM smokers. The key
problems were for its "lack of strength", "need to be
sweeter" and its unpleasant aftertaste".

These "criticisms" were far less pronounced among the 100 MM
smokers although they also perceived the product as
â€œsomewhat weak tasting".

(See Table 3)
MPID Commentary

Consideration should be given to increasing the Harley
Lights 100 MM's strength in order to enhance its appeal

especially among 18-29 year olds.
