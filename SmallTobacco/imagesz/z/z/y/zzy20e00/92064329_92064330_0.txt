MEMORANDUM
September 24, 1993
TO: W. R. Deaton
FROM: E. F. DeLaura
RE: Panel Results: Harley Lights 100 MM R&D #1385-6/93

Attached are the Low Tar panel results for The Harley Lights
V 1OOMM proto.

Results for the previously reported Harley Lights V 85 MM
and the Regular brand are also shown as a source of
reference.

Just to note, the Regular brand testing in which these Low
Tar NM panel members tested their own brand blinded, will
serve as benchmark data in this and subsequent/panel memos.
The Regular brand results represent the "ideal ratings" as
most respondents were extremely favorable in their
evaluations for their regular brand (in test).

Product Specs are as follows:

Harley Lts. 100 MM 9.8 mgs. tar -71 mgs. nic.
Harley Lts. 85 MM 8.5 mgs. tar .66 mgs. nic.
Conclusions

The Harley Lts. 100 MM proto (1385-6-93) attained an average
acceptance of 6.5 among total respondents. While the
product scored well among 100 MM and smokers 30 years of age
and over, it netted out poorly with the 85 MM smokers and

those 18 to 29 years of age.

The 85 MM proto (1592/93-93) fared better in total, 6.8, and
among all sub groups. Of note is how the 18-29 year old
smokers rated all three products the lowest of all the
sub-groups.

(See Table 1)

Product Performance
Total Smokers

The key problem with Harley Lts. 100 MM is its "too
light/not strong enough" taste. It was not cited as overly
harsh tasting or having an unpleasant aftertaste.
