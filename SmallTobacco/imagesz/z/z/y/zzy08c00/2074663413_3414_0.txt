Re: Appearance by Ian L. Uydess at The Coalition for a Smoke-

Free Erie County Awards Luncheon.

The luncheon today was sold out and I did not hear the
keynote speaker, Ian L. Uydess. There were about 120 people
present at the luncheon.

According to the luncheon program (copy attached) Dr.
Uydess was introduced by K. Michael Cummings of Roswell Park Cancer
Institute, who was recently in the news in connection with the
Roswell survey concerning smoking by 9th grade students.

According to the program, the following were given
awards: Dennis T. Gorski (Erie County Executive), Randi Cohen-
Kennedy (Erie County Legislator), Charles Swanick (Chair of Erie
County Legislature), Bud Caroll (New Voice Club), Louise
Hallingsworth-Lindsey (American Cancer Society), Phillip Morris
(man featured in local anti-smoking ad campaign), Gail O'Brien
(Teacher at Casey Middle School), Sheila Mahoney (Channel 7
Eyewitness News), and Quality Markets. The Distinguished Service
Award was given to Dr. Cummings. Presenting the awards for The
Coalition for a Smoke-Free Erie County were Gretchen Leffler,

Executive Director, and Phil Habishaw.
