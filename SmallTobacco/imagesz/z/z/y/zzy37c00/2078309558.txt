From today's daybooks:

Towa Attorney General Tom Miller holds a series of press conferences around
the state to announce his 1998 legislative agenda on tobacco. First one is
9:30 a.m. CST, Hoover Building, Des Moines IA. Later press conferences will
be held in Davenport, Cedar Rapids, Mason City and Sioux City.

Assume product liability legislation is included in his proposals. Do we expect
Miller to announce his support for a tax increas as well? Any other info on what
he's supporting?

Towa AP wire story indicated that the tax issue is D.O.A. with Republicans,
including Branstad. On the media front, it's probably best to let the Governor
and other legislators speak out against increasing taxes of any kind. If
they're going to oppose the tax increase, we might be better off focusing the
efforts of our allies on the other components of Miller's agenda. Thoughts?
