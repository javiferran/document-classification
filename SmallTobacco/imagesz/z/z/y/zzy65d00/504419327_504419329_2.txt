Highlights of the latest Brand FF Team meeting minutes were reviewed.
Of particular interest were the NFO results from CAMEL F prototypes
FT-3846A & B, where attribute scores could not account for the lower %
7+ ratings when compared to Marlboro KS among competitive smokers.

The team agreed that tipping paper differences may be having an in-
fluence on acceptance and that this issue should be resolved.

(Results were issued to team for reference. )

Meetings will be held about once a month according to Brand Team
schedule. The next meeting will be August 16, if everyone can attend.
