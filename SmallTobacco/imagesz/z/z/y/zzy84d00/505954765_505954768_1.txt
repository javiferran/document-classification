An important consequence of the increased heat transfer to
the capsule is a lowering of the combustion temperature produced
by a heat sink effect from the aluminum fingers. It is
advantageous to increase the puff count and to lower the CO
production and both these effects are achieved when the fuel burns
at a lower temperature.

Scope of Invention

The essential elements of this apparatus are the aluminum
fingers which encompass the fuel source and bring the heat back to
the macrocapsule body. A diagram is shown below.

Examples

Devices tested thus far in the laboratory are made with 40 mm
aluminum macrocapsules. The capsule is shaped with siccors
producing a 30 mm body with fingers protruding 8 mm from the end
as shown in the above diagram. Models with two and three fingers
have been tried and appear satisfactory.

Temperatures have been measured on the surface of the
macrocapsule body 5, 15 and 25 mm bagk. The fuel sources were 10
mm in length, with 2 mm inserted inside the macrocapsule body.
The finger-capsules had two fingers each 2.5 mm wide, so that 36%
of the surface of the fuel source was covered with aluminum
fingers(the combined width of the fingers is 5 mm, while the
circumference of the entire macrocapsule is 14 mm). The puff by
puff temperatures have been compared to those with standard
Macrocapsules (without fingers) and are presented in graphical
form in Figures 1 and 2. The second puff was taken 4 seconds
following the first puff but the succeeding puffs were all 60
seconds apart. Figure 1 shows the maximum temperatures recorded
during the puff while the smolder temperatures are depicted in
