ratio also decreases suggests that the DMgersi ly eye combustion
temperature of the burning fuel cone. The increase Ofi—cowrt— is

probably also a result of this lower temperature produced by the heat

sink effect of the fingers.

The best finger-capsule design contains two or three fingers
covering a total of between 14 and 36 percent of the fuel source

area and extending its entire length.

°

Conclusion a

The potential advantages with the use of a finger-capsule
are: (1) more rapid and efficient heat transfer from the fuel
source back to the substrate and tobacco, (2) increased puff count

and (3) lower mainstream CO per puff.
