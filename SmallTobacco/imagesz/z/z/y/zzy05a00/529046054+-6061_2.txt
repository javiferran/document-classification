Angelle Seeling prior to the 36" Annual Pontiac Excitement Nationals:

“We're approaching Columbus with the same attitude we had at Chicago. We've
never been to a final at Columbus and we’d like to end that sircak at this race. We had
another disappointing week at Chicago — just like last year — but we're still No. 1 in the
Winston points. We’re in the lead, but we’re not looking at it like we're the leaders.
George (Bryce) and I want to go rounds and win races. That’s our goal every week. If
we can do that, and not be concerned with who’s in front of or who’s behind us, we’re
going to be in a position to win the Winston championship when we get to Pomona.”
