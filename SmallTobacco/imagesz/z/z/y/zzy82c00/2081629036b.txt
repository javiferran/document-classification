Dear Charlie,

According to BPC, they had a retailer (chained account) complaint concerning for outside spec. of P100B(7400).
Total 9 packs out of one carton were collected from that retailer.

A few month ago, there was an incident on the news that some forgery tobacco (JT brand) which illegally imported
from China were found by consumer who bought cigarettes from a retailer. Since them, consumer as well as
retailer are quite nervous about the product.

We believe that this is isolated incident as no other complaints are reported. However, please kindly inspect the
sample and answer to the following questions.

1. Is it a genuine PM products?
2. If yes, which region was it suppose to be exported?
3. Is there any possibility that it can be misplaced in the Japan Domestic products?

One sample pack is being sent to you via TNT AWB# 228750764 for your inspection and the remaining 8 packs
are being sent to you under JPQ# 39146 by BPC.

Your early reply would be highly appreciated.
Thank you in advance for your help.

Best regards,

Kayoko Sonoda
