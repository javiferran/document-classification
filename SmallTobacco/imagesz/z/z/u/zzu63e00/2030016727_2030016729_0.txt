Subject: Pulper Discharge Pumps - Line 3

Status

A plan to test two alternative types of stators on the Line 3
Netzsch Pulper discharge pumps (memo attached for ref.) was ap-
proved and the purchase requisition submitted in mid-December.

As part of the recently implemented Omnibus purchasing process,
these items now must be ordered from Netzsch through Ferguson En-
terprises rather than from the local Netzsch factory rep., Wood
Equipment. I was informed by Wood’s sales rep. Friday 1/14/94
that the order had not been placed. According to Ferguson, as of
1/21/94, the stators are on order and delivery will be expedited.
Ordinarily delivery is 6-8 weeks.

Recommendation:

I would like to add an additional evaluation to this testing
plan. This would be to install one of the next larger size of
the Netzch pump (Model NE90A) on Line 3 for a direct comparison
with the existing smaller model (NE80A). This would enable us to
determine if the larger pump is worth the additional cost in
terms of extending pump life. The existing drive and motor from
the smaller pump can be reused so the primary difference between
the two models is the stator and rotor size. The additional cost
per pump (with the standard Ethylene Propylene (EP) stator and
316 SS rotor) is $1908.
