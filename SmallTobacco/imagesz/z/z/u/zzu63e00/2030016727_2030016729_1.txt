The larger pump should operate fine in our service on A Nol
based on its pump curve. This is true throughout the potent SAB
operating envelope from 7.0-9.5% consistency. This range is C
chosen based on my discussions with the area experts and from the
original criteria used to size these pumps.

The larger pump should go in with minimum, if any, modifications
to the piping system. The existing base plate may require some
minor modification due to the new pump being 4" longer. As stat-
ed above, the power frame is the same for the two pumps. The
aifferences are the stator and rotor length.

Revised Testing Plan:

Previously the plan was to test the NE80A standard stator, an ad-
justable type stator and one made of Buna CB for cost/benefit
analysis. Three of each type of stator will be used in the test-
ing. The NE90A would be tested in the same manner, i.e. three
stators of each type are to be installed and the results com-
pared. The incremental cost to test the larger pump over and
above that currently spent on maintaining these pumps through
this number of stator replacements is $4906. These costs are
summarized below.

which was a misquote by the vendor.

** The Buna CB stators are less expensive than the EP for a given
size. Vendor originally stated this as the opposite case as

stated in the original test proposal.
