MARLIN APRIL TOPLINE REPORT
The MARLIN Topline Report covering the April period was issued on May 30.

Performance Overview:

- Industry Full Price/Savings mix held about flat in April. Retail performance of most

companies was also stable month-to-month.

RJR’s Full Price performance was in line with expectations. We experienced continued slight
SOM and SOFP softness related to increased retail presence on Marlboro, continued high
levels of competitive Branded Savings discounting, and less aggressive discounting activity
than anticipated on our own key FP brands.

RJR’s Savings business stayed on trend from March to April, with slight growth on DORAL
partially offsetting continued softness on MONARCH and BEST VALUE.

Outlook:

- We don’t expect to see any change in our FP performance in May. We have no national

workplan activities on CAMEL/SELECT for May and we'll continue to be impacted by the
same competitive factors that contributed in April.

Our Savings business in total will also likely remain somewhat soft, but DORAL is expected
to gain share in May as retail support (BSGSF) increases.

- Given the MARLIN audit schedule for the May period, retail data for May is expected to

show little, if any, impact from the PM product recall.
