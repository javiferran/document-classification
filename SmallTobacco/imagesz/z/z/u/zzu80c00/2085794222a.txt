Subject: Superslims US patient case - it's aver

i'm pleased to report that the B&W patent infringement suit re Virginia Slims Superstims is finally over in the US. PM USA
has won.

In particular, last fall PM USA was successful at the Federal Circuit in arguing that the relevant claims of B&W's US
Reissue Patent 32,615 re a cigarette w/ a reduced circumference were invalid, which upheld a '99 ruling to the same effect
by federal district court in Louisville in a trial beginning in '89. B&W attempted to have a rehearing at the Federal Circuit
and was denied. The time has now passed for B&W's last recourse, a petition to the Supreme Court, without any filing by
them.

Re specifics, this clears the way for future PM USA production of Superslims for export, assuming no relevant BAT patents
in the particular countries of destination. We are currently researching the issue specifically in Japan to see if there are
other BAT patents in addition to the BAT Japanese patent successfully invalidated by JT with PM assistance and will
report the results when available in ~3-6 weeks. Of course, our proposed global resolution to BAT in response to their
offer to setile the issue in Australia would resolve this question on a worldwide basis.

Special recognition needs to be made of Jim Schardt, who handled this entire matter for many years with great skill,
patience, and foresight.

We'll keep you posted. Pls. let me know if you have any questions. thanks
