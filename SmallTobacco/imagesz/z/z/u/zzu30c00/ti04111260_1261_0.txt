Dear Editorialist:

Over the past few years, many state and local legislators
have been grappling with a new issue -- whether or not to
restrict smoking in many "public" places.

The debate is often emotional. It revolves around issues
of health, management of private property, personal freedom
and law enforcement, to name a few.

The enclosed reprint, from our publication, LEGISLATIVE
POLICY, provides a thought-provoking perspective on the
subject.

I think you'll find it both informative interesting.
