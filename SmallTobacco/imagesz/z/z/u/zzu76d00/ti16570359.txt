Dear Roger.

On behalf of the Los Angeles Hospitality Coalition, I want to thank you in ad-
vance for your support of our efforts to qualify a referendum overturning the Los Angeles
City smoking ban. [f left unchallenged, the ban passed Iast week by the Los Angeles City
Council would have a devastating impact on city rescaurants, hotels and the entire Los An-
geles hospitality industry.

We hope that RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company will make a contribution in the
amount of $71,619.00. Please forward your check to the attention of Cary Davidson at 777
Figueroa Street, Suite 3400, Los Angeles, CA, 90017. As this effort is extremely time sensi-
uve, please have your check or wire to our office or bank on July 1, 1993 if at all possible.

Again, thank you for agreeing to help preserve a positive, competitive business
climate for the Los Angeles city hospitality industry.

Sincerely,
a
jer han
Lee Stitzenberger
