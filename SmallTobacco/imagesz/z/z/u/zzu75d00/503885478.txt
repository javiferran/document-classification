Dear Ron:

This is in response to your letter of October 13 asking
for Reynolds to assist you as you plan to participate in
the World Cup and the U.S. Ski Team. Unfortunately, I
must advise you, Ron, that we do not sponsor individuals
in such events and, therefore, I am afraid that we cannot
be of any assistance to you. However, I was very pleased
to hear from you again and I am also very impressed with
the goals that you have set for yourself. Please give my
best to your Mom and Dad, "

Warm regards.
Sincerely,
(S /
