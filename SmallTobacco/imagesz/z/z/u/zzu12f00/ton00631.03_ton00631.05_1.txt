Much of what Dr. Halperin had to say was for statisticians

in statistical jargon. He distributed a number of tables which
he referred to in his talk. His reference to "lower risk scores"
in fact referred to upper risk groups. One of his tables appears
to imply that the longer the study goes on the less likely it
will be to detect "the anticipated effect of intervention."

The reason for this is explained by a lag factor which represents
the time between beginning of intervention and the point at which
intervention reaches its maximal effect.

In another table, Dr. Halperin indicates that the percent of
non-smokers in the MRFIT screening process is already observably
higher than the percent of non-smokers in the Framingham study.

Some of the problems alluded to by Dr. Halperin were highlighted
in the questions raised by members of the audience. Mr. Mantel.
asked “Are you using just one age category, namely 35- “57, in
your analysis?" Answer: Yes.

Question: Are not the age increments important even in this
range?
Answer: Yes

(Mr. Ederer) Question: What would a negative result imply at
end of this study?

(Halperin's answer was the usual one given by a statistician
to a question of this type): Statistics studies
are not designed to “accept” the hypothesis being
tested.

Kastenbaum referred to Table 3 of the handout which suggests
that it is probably likely that a2 negative result will indeed
be forthcoming.

Kastenbaum asked if estimates of errors had been calculated
for the projected risks. The answer was that these errors are
difficult to estimate but that they have been looked at.
