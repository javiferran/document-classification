Process Technology & Development

I. ADVANCED PROCESS TECHNOLOGY

e Extraction Investigation

The extraction/spray drying process line in 112 Shed is
operational. Equipment characterization is in progress
and minor modifications are being made as necessary.
Several extended runs, 24 hours or more, are planned in
order to achieve equilibrium operation and develop com-
plete mass balance data. Spray dried extracts are being
evaluated in products. The extracted tobacco is also
being studied to determine its potential uses.

II. PROCESS DEVELOPMENT
e® G-7 Pilot Line

Qualification G-7 product has been prepared via the G-7
Pilot Line and will be evaluated against G-7 plant prod-
uct to establish base line parity. Brand R&D and PT&D
have finalized plans for separate extraction .G-7 prod-
ucts which will be prepared during April. The plans
consist of 12 products to determine the influences of
stem, scrap, flue-cured and burley extract.

e Primary Processing Specifications

The strategy for obtaining target and control limits has
been developed. Brand R&D will determine the initial
reject limits for casing, G-13, and top flavor

" application.
