CENTURY

American Decal reported difficulty in Panama City, Florida,
with their water decal tax stamps not sticking to the film on
CENTURY in the Eli Witt account. No other states or areas have
reported difficulty. Should this become widespread, we would
recommend Mobil's acrylic coated film rather than Norprop's
co-extruded film for these products.

FF 'Tar' Limits Study

Puff-by-puff analyses of seven products have been completed.

Data reduction and analysis is in progress. MDD Topline results
will be available the week of July 25. An informal work session
has been scheduled to review these results on July 28.
