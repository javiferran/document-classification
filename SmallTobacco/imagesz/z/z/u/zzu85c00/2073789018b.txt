Subject: Aniicle in British Medical Journal

Attached is a recent article in British Medical Journal that describes tobacco litigation in the US
and reviews developments elsewhere. Also included is an editorial announcing a theme issue to
be published in August on tobacco control.

Piease be forewarned that if you try to print these articles, you will get areas that are blacked out.
These are most fikely placed by the publishers to discourage readers from printing large numbers
of paper copies. If you want a paper copy, | was able to retrieve the same article from another
System which | printed out. Let me know if you want it. Judy
