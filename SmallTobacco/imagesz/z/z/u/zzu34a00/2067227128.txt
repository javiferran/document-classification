Subject: SCoR, clinical study 09/02

Dear Hans and Debbie,

In order to be prepared to any inquiries about this study to start in September with white packs of ‘U5’, Mike Pfeil suggests
that a holding statement be prepared. Could you give me your facts input such as

Start and end of clinical trial

Number and characteristics of subjects (e.g., gender, race, voluntary and reimbursed, pregnancy, age)
Locations of trial

CRO and principal investigator

How is addressed that subjects are not exposed to increased risks

How does the test smoking relate to the ‘normal’ smoking of the subjects?

What is the purpose of the study?

By the way: What arrangement is contracted with the GRO in case they obtain media inquiries?

Regards,
Roger
