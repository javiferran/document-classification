OBJECT:

To provide the means for the identification and analysis of low
molecular weight syrup fragments in enzyme-hydrolyzed hydroxypropylated

starch.

SUMMARY : -

The possibility was recognized that syrups of enzyme-hydrolyzed
hydroxypropylated starch might be of commercial value. However, prior
to obtaining FDA approval for the sale of such material, a survey of
the low molecular weight fragments to DP4 would have been desired.
Penick & Ford requested an estimate of the effort that might be required
to obtain and develop the methods and information. Preliminary analyses
of typical syrups from Penick & Ford were made using .gas chromatography (1)
and thin-layer chromatography (2). The results of this investigation, along
with recommendations for possible paths of approach, were furnished
Penick & Ford. Since then, the decision has been reached by them to

terminate this program.

MEMORANDUM:

Three samples of enzyme degraded hydroxypropyl] starch syrups were
prepared by Mr. R. B. Nelson of Penick & Ford from propylene oxide-substituted
corn starch (3). These ranged in D.E. from 14.6 to 16.7%. The base starches
used in the production of these syrups ranged from 1.30 to 4.42% propylene
oxide substitution based on dry substance. The syrups were carbon treated,
ion-exchanged and concentrated to about 80% total solids prior to being

received by us.
