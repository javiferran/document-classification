A preliminary examination was made using gas chromatography and
thin-layer chromatography. Existing methods (1, 2) were used for this
purpose. In this examination, no substances were found other than normal
sugars (dextrose, maltose, maltotriose, and maltotetraose). On this
basis, it was suspected that the enzyme might selectively degrade the
starch, avoiding groups that have been hydroxypropylated. This would
help to explain the high viscosities of the resulting syrups. Some
possible methods suggested to prove or disprove this were:

I. Use of Pellicon Membranes - These membranes have a molecular
cutoff range of 800-1000. Using these membranes, the low
molecular weight material could be isolated and a colorimetric
method (4) applied which would measure the hydroxypropyl] groups
present. This could be compared with the total hydroxypropyl]
group content of the material.

II. Gel Permeation Chromatography - A closer examination of hydroxypropyl]
content vs. molecular weight could be attained using this technique.

III. Continued Enzyme Degradation - The material could be subjected to
enzyme hydrolysis over a long period of time. If selective hydrolysis

occurs, the D.E. should remain at a low value.

It was recommended that techniques I and III be applied first. The estimated
time was one month.

After the above recommendation was made to Penick & Ford, the entire
project was re-evaluated. The decision was made to stop the project at
this point.
