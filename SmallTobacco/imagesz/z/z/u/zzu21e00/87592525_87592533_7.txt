pup appeared pale. A dark red mark was noted on the head of two low level
pups. Otherwise, observations on the appearance of the fetuses were not

. Natural Delivery, Lactation, and Weaning Data

Gestation, live birth, and lactation indices; litter size, and
mean pup weights obtained from females littering normally are presented
in Table No. 3.

The duration of the gestation period was comparable between
control and test animals (control, 22 days; 15 mg/kg/day, 22 days; and
75 mg/kg/day, 21.8 days). No instances of abortion, dystocia’ or of delayed
or prolonged labor were observed. The gestation index was 100% for all
- groups.

‘Two control females and two high level pups (one male and one
female) were found dead at birth; these animals were preserved in 102%
neutral buffered formalin. The live birth index for the control and
high level groups was 98% and for the low level group was 100%. The
pups of one high level litter appeared small.

Two control pups (males), five low level pups (two males
and three females), and six high level pups (three males and three
females) were found dead or missing (apparently cannibalized) during
the nursing period. The lactation indices obtained were as follows:

controls - 97%, low level - 92%, and high level - 922.
