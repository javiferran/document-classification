SUMMARY

This study was initiated to evaluate the effect of a synthetic
chemical on the general reproductive performance of albino rats. The
test material was administered orally to male albino rats for 60 days
and to female albino rats for 14 days prior to mating at dosage levels
of 0, 15, and 75 mg/kg/day. Approximately one-half of the females were
sacrificed on Day 14 of gestation and Caesarean sections were performed.
The renaining females were allowed to deliver normally, and the litters

“were carried to weaning. Administration of the test compound continued
throughout the study. |

All parental animals survived the study, and no outstanding
effects were noted in the males or females. .

There were no meaningful differences in the number and
placement of implantation sites, resorption sites, and live fetuses among
the females sacrificed on Day 14 of gestation.

Fertility indices for the animals that received the test

material were not meaningfully different from the controls. Gestation,
