Normal Delivery of Offspring

The remaining does were allowed to litter normally. The litters
were examined within 24 hours after birth for litter size, dead pups, live
pups, and external anatomical structure of the newborn. Body weights of
the litters were recorded by sex, and the litters were arbitrarily reduced
to a maximum of eight pups to be carried through a 21-day lactation period
to weaning. Pup weights by sex were recorded after culling and again at
four days and at 21 days postparturition (at weaning). Mortality,
appearance, and behavior of the offspring were observed frequently
throughout lactation. Following weaning of the last litter, the offspring

and all male and remaining female parents were sacrificed and discarded.

Tissue Preservation
“The ovaries and uterus of each female sacrificed for Caesarean
- delivery, fetuses delivered by Caesarean section, and dead pups which were
recovered from normally delivered litters were preserved in 10% neutral
buffered formalin. All tissues are being held at Hazleton Laboratories, Inc.,

‘for possible future examination.

Analysis of Data

Indices of fertility, gestation, live birth, and lactation were
derived as follows: fertility index, number of pregnancies observed divided

by number of females mated; gestation index, number of full-term litters

born divided by the number of pregnancies observed in females which were
