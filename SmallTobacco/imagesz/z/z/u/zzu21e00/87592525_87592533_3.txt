HAZLETON LABORATORIES

 

Two females were placed with’ one male (within each group) in
breeding cages, and the males were rotated weekly. Using the vaginal
douche method, each female was examined daily for a maximum of 21
consecutive days for the presence of spermatozoa. The day on which
sperm were first observed was designated as Day 0 of gestation. Upon
observation of sperm or following the 21-day period of mating, the
females were individually housed. Following nating, the males were

returned to their individual cages until the completion of the study.

Observations and Records

Mortality, appearance, and behavior of the males and females
were observed daily. Food consumption was tecorded weekly during the
premating period only. Body weights were recorded weekly throughout

the study.

Interval Sacrifice for Caesarean Delivery

| Approximately one-half of the females in which sperm were
' observed were sacrificed on Day 14 of gestation. Caesarean sections
were performed, and the following observations were recorded: number
and placement of uterine implantation and resorption sites, number
and placement of live and dead fetuses, fetal weight and length

(crown --rump), and fetal anatomical structure. Gross necropsies with

examination of uterine and visceral structures were performed on each

of the females sacrificed for Caesarean delivery.
