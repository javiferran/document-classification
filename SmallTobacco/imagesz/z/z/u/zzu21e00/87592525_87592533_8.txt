Mean litter size and mean pup weights at birth (within 24 hours),
at four days postpartum, and at weaning were comparable among control and
test groups. One control pup, one low level pup, and one high level litter
were observed to be small at weaning.‚Äù Necropsy findings on approximately
one-third of each litter at weaning were not remarkable; findings were

confined to a green-tinged kidney and dark red medulla of one low level

male.
