Mating Behavior and Fertility Data

The mean number of days from pairing to observation of sperm in

Control 15 mg/kg/day 75_ mg/kg/day
No. of matings 20 20 . 20
No. of pregnancies 20 18: ° ” 16
Fertility Index 100% 90% 80%

The fertility indices for the test groups are lower than the
controls in this study, but are-within acceptable ranges as based on

previous experience in this laboratory with studies of similar design.
