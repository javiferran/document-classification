mean lung function residuals of sons or

_ daughters of fathers from the various occu-

pational groups. Also, there were no differ-
ences in children’s residuals among the
four groups defined according to mothers’
work and smoking status (housewife or
working: nonsmoking or smoking).

A comparison of lung function residuals
between groups eliminates the effects of
height, weight and age (12). Thus, any
correlation between residuals of spouses,
parents and children, or of siblings would
suggest an effect of other factors, such as
family resemblance in lung function (ta-
bles 7 and 8). Analysis of covariance

showed that lung function residuals of
children in the four parent smoking
groups (both smokers; father smoker,
mather nonsmoker; mother smoker, father
honsmoker; both nonsmokers) were the
same after adjusting for mothers’ and fa-

thers’ residuals. Hence, the different
smoking groups may be combined for the
analysis of parent-child correlations. In
these correlations, each parent-child pair
was counted independently; i.e., ifa father
had three sons. he was included three
times, once with each son, in the fether-
son correlation. For the sibling correla-
tions, the oldest sib was paired with the sib
closest to him in age. Then the second
oldest was paired with the third oldest and
60 on. Thus each sib except the oldest and
youngest was a member of two pairs, once
as the older and once as the youngest of
the pair. None of the correlation coeffi-
cients between spouses were significant.
In other pairs, at least three out of the five
residuals yielded significant results, ex-
cept between brothers. For children who
had never smoked, the correlations were
similar to those in all children shown in
