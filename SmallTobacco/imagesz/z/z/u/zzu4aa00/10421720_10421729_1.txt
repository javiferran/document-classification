+ the conclusion

 

 

‘that passive smoking (inhaling other peo-

ple’s smoke) is injurious to health, particu-
larly that of children (8).

The prevalence of cough in children
however, is not only associated with pa-
rental smoking, but. also with respiratory
symptoms among parents (6, 7). After ad-
justment for the positive correlation be-
tween symptoms in parents and children,
parental smoking had no significant effect
on children’s symptoms. Thus, smoking
parents may affect their offepring’s respi-
ratory system indirectly, rather than via a
direct effect of smoke. For example, smck-
ing adults often cough and produce phlegm
and thereby tranamit infection (6).

All these results are based on children’s
symptoms as described by their parents.
This may introduce bias. Parents who
smoke have more symptoms and may be
more conscious of them in their children.
Parents who over- or under-report their
own symptoms may do the same for their
children. In this study, we have asited the
children themselves some of the questions
on respiratory symptoms. Also, children of
smoking parents are more likely to smoke
than children of nonsmokers (8). Unlike
the previous studies, we have considered
smoking habits of children in our analy-
BEB.

Familial resemblance in lung function,
apart from the known factors of height,
sex and ethnic group, appears to be slight,
according to studies in twin pairs (9). Peak
flow in five-year-old children correlates
with peak flow in their parents (10), but
this may be due to correlation between
their heights. Peak flow in children was
significantly related to their own histories
of bronchitis and pneumonia. but there
was no association between their peak
flow and their parents’ smoking habits,
respiratory morbidity and social class. In
the Tecumseh study (8), age- and height-
adjusted FEV,. scores correzated signifi-
cantly not only betweer: parents and their
children, but also between siblings and
even between-spouses. However, these re-

sults were not controlled fdr smoking
habits, nor were the possible effects of pas-
sive smoking on lung function considered.

In the present study we have attempted to
separate the effects of smoking from other

familial factors on both hung function and

respiratory symptoms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

This investigation was part of a large
survey on lung disease in the three towns
of Lebanon and Ansonia in Connecticut,
and Winnsboro in South Carolina. Fami-
lies in which both parents and at least one
child between the ages of seven and 18 had
been examined were identified by name,
address and telephone number. Family
groups were checked from replies by par-
ents about the numbers and namesof their
children and replies by children about
their brothers and sisters, to eliminate
these in which there was any doubt about
the accuracy of the family grouping. There
were 418 families with data for both par-
ents and 915 children. We only report on
the 376 white families since there were too
few blacks for detailed analysis. Table 1
shows the distribution of the white fami-
lies by town and by age and sex of the
children.

The methods used for interviewing sub-
jects and for measuring lung function have
been described elsewhere (11). Prediction
equations for lung function in white males
and females were derived from the data of
ell healthy, lifetime nonsmoking adults
and children in the total survey population
(12). From these equations, the proportion
(R?) of the total variance in lung function
