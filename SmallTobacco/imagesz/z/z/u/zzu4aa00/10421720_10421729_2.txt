which is expiained by height, weight. and
age is determined.

The prediction equations were derived
separately for boys aged 7-17 and men
aged 18+, and for girls aged 7-14 and
women aged 154 (12). Since there were
few older children, only the girls aged 7-14
and boys aged 7-17 (the age ranges in the
prediction equations for children) were in-

chided in the present analysia of lung func-
tidn. Residual lung function was obtained
for each subject by subtracting the pre-
dicted value from the cbserved value. A
residual of less than zero meane that lung
function is lower than expected from the
data in healthy Mfetime nonsmokers.
Since the prediction equations for girls and
boys use the natura! logarithm (In) of the
function values. the residuals of children
are obtained in transformed units (e.g.,
residual In FVC); values for men and
women are expressed in liters or liters/sec.

Syroptoms and chest illnesses were de-
fined as follows:

Cough and/or phlegm—usual cough at
any time of the day or night. and/or
usual phlegm production at any time
of the day or night.

Wheeze—any history of wheezing or
chest tightness.

Asthma — “yes” to the question, “Have
you ever had bronchial asthma?"

Bronchitis—“ves* to the question,
“Have you ever had bronchitis?"

Pneumonia-"yes” to the question,
“Have vou ever had pneumonia?”

Family history of asthma—“yes” to the
question. “Have your parents. broth-
ets, sisters. or children ever had
asthma?”

All subjects including children an-
awered the questions on smoking, cough
and phlegm for themselves. Parents an-
swered the questions on wheeze and on
family history of asthma for children aged
14 and under. Data on chest illnesses in
children were not analyzed because some
of the answers were thought to be unrelia-
ble.

To relate the socioeconomic class of par-
ents to the symptoms ond lung function of
their children, we clossified fathers into
eight groups based on the US Department
of Labor's occupational classification of
1865 (13), and mothers as either house-
wives or those working outside their
homes.

Symptoms. We determined the preva-
lence of symptoms in groups according to
symptom prevalence i in parents: 1) neither
porent had the symptom, 2) mother only
had the symptom, 3) father only had the
symptom. or 4) both parents had the symp-
tom. Prevalences of cough and/or phlegm
were highest in children in group 4, but
there was no association between parents’
and children's symptoms when all four
groups were compared (table 2). The re-
sults were the same for children who had
never smoked. For wheeze, the prevalence
in parents correlated significantly with
that in their children aged 15 years and
under, but not with prevalence in older
children, possibly because of smaller num-
bers (table 3). However, parents answered
the wheeze questions for the younger chil-
dren; only the older ones answered for
themselves. Again, the results were simi-
lar in the subsample of children who had
never smoked.
