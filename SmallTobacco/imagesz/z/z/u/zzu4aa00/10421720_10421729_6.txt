tables 7 and 8. Positive correlations be-
tween parents’ and children’s lung func-
tion residuals persisted when families
with histories of asthma in parents or rela-
tives were excluded.

The contribution of familial factors ahd
passive smoking to children’s lung func-
tion can be assessed from a multiple
regression anlaysis (table 9). The child's
lung function measurement (not the resid-
ual: was the dependent variable. The inde-
pendent variables were the height,
weight. and age terms from the original
prediction equation (12), and the parents’
lung function residuals. the four parents”
smoking categones, and a family history
of asthma. Mothers’ or fathers’ residuals.
or both, were significant variables for sev-
eral measurements in boys as well as girls.
The variable representing families in
which the mother smokes was significant
for MEF50% in girls. For girls aged 10
years, of average height and weight (148
cm, 37 kg), the predicted MEF50% was
2.86 liters/sec if the mother smoked, and
3.05 liters/sec if she did not. The family
history of asthma variable was significant
for boys’ FEV,» and MEF25%. Quantita-
tively, this variable, too, caused only a
small difference in predicted values (e.g.,
at age 10. height 148 cm. weight 40 ke.
FEV,» for boys with a family history of
asthma was 2.19 liters, versus 2.25 liters
for those without). When only children
who had never smoked were included in
the analysis. the results were similar. ex-
cept that the family history of asthma var-

iable was also significant for boys’
MEF50. ,

Table 9 also shows the percentage of the
variance (R*) in the children’s lung func-
tion measurements which is explained by
the height, weight and age terms, and by
the addition of the significant family
terms. The greatest proportion of the vari-
ance is explained by the height, weight,
and age terms (Rj). Relatively little is
added by the parents’ residuals, the smok-
ing term, or the asthma term (compare Ri
with R34).

Discussion

We have found no significant relation
between parents’ smoking and respiratory
symptoms or lung function in their chil-
dren. Previous reports that “passive smok-
ing” may cause respiratory disease in chil-
dren (1, 3, 4) were based on symptoms
only. They did not exclude the possibility
that the effect of passive smoking may be
indirect, by transmission of infection from
coughing parents to their children. In two
studies (6, 7), the association between pa-
rental smoking and symptoms could be
attributed to increased cough or phlegm
among smoking parents. In only one study
(2), infant respiratory disease was associ-
ated with parental smoking. even if the
parents had no symptoms, but this associ-
ation was absent in children aged 1-5.

In relating parents’ and children’s symp-
toms, bias may be introduced when par-
ets answer the questions for their off-
spring. In our study, all children them-
