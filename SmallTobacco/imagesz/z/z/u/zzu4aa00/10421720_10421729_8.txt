not examined at the same time; in Tecum-
seh, spouses were usually seen together,
and thus calibration and other factors
(e.g., acute respiratory illness in family)
might yield slightly higher correlations. In
addition, we found no significant correla-
tions between brothers aged 7-17, al-
though there were significant correlations
between sisters 7-14 and in brother-sister
pairs. Excluding boys aged 15-17, thus
making the age grouping comparable to
that for girls, does not change the results
for brother pairs. Nor are the results dif-
ferent when boys who have smoked ciga-
rettes are excluded. The lack of a signifi-
cant correlation in brothers is difficult to
explain.

_ After accounting for height, weight,
age. sex and race, the additional contribu-
tion to children’s lung function from the
parents, although significant. is relatively
small (table 9). It could easily be missed
when smaller numbers are studied (9).
The largest relative increase of R? occurs
for MEF25% in bovs. where the height,
weight and age terms explain 54.5 per cent
of the variance: the other family factors
add a further 3.& per cent. Even here, the
effect on the absolute value of lung func-
tion is small. Predicted MEF25% fer 11.
year-old boys theight 161 cm, weight 45
kg) is 1.62 liters/sec if only height. weight
and age are considered. Adding the aver-
age mothers’ residual decreases this value
to 1.60 liters/sec, and further addition of
the family history of asthma variable de-
creases MEF25% to 1.48 liters/sec. Thus
familia) factors. apart from those related
to height. weight, age, sex and race, are
relatively unimportant in determining
lung function.

Chronic obstructive lung disease and
even more, asthma. may in part be deter-
mined genetically (14-16). Children with a
family history of asthma have lower resid-
uals for al! lung function measvrements
than children without such a history (table
6). Girls show the same trends as boys but
the differences are not so marked. Wheez-

ing in parents is associated with lower
lung furiction residuals in boys but not in
girls. Asthma may begin at an earlier age
in boys than in girls (17, 18), and boys
tuight be more exposed to antigenic agents
in their work or hobbies. Both familial and
environmental factors may contribute to
reduction of lung function in children who
have a family history of asthma or whose
parents wheeze.

There have been no convincing reports
ori the influence of passive smoking on
either adults’ or children’s lung function.
In our study, as expected, adult smokers
had much lewer lung function residuals
than the nonsmokers (table 5), but there
was no evidence that exposure to one's
spouse's cigarette smoke affected lung
function. Nor do the results of this study
suggest that parents’ smoking has any-
thing but a minor effect on children’s lung
function. The only significant finding was
that daughters’ flow rates were lowest in
families in which the mother smoked and
the father was a nonsmoker (table 9. This
could be due to chance, and the effect is in
any case small.

Heavy exposure to other people's smoke
causes nonsmokers to absorb carbon mon-
oxide and nicotine, and sensitive individ-
uals to develop cough, wheeze. and respi-
ratory distress (19). People are. however.
rarely if ever subjected to such extreme
coriditions in the home. Although an envi-
ronmental study af 20 homes showed
higher particulate levels in hemes with
smokers. there was no evidence that this
was related to the presence or absence of
disease in children (20). We conclude that
exposure to low levels of smoke produced
by cigarette smokers does not result in
chronic respiratory symptoms or loss of
lung function among children nor among
adults.
