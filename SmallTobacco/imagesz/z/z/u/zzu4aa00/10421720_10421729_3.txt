ined by comparing a group in which par-
ents were both present nonsmokers with a
group in which at least one parent was a
present cigarette smoker. There were no
significant . differences between these
groups in the prevalence of either cough
and/or phlegm or wheeze in either boys or
girls. When the nonsmokers were further
divided into either ex-smokers or lifetime
nonsmokers, the results remained insig-
nificant. Also, there was no significant in-
teraction between parent's symptoms and
smoking in relation to children's symp-
toms.

 

 

 

 

 

the prevalence of cough and/or phlegm be-
tween mothers and fathers, there was a
significant relationship in the prevalence
of wheeze (x? = 6.44; p < 0,025). Symptoms
in parents were related to their smoking
habits. Cough, phlegm and wheeze were
significantly more prevalent among male
and female current smokers. However,
prevalence of these symptoms in nonsmok-
ers was untelated to whether or not their
spouses smbked.

We also attempted to relate symptom
prevolences in children to their parents’
reports of respiratory illness. Families
were classified into non-mutually exclu-
sive groups in which at least one parent
