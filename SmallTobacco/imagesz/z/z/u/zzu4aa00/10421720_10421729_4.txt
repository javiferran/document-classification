Lung function. To examine both active
and passive smoking in relation to lung
function in parents, we divided the fami-
lies into four groups according to parents’
current cigarette smoking: 1) both smok-
ers, 2} father smoker, mother nonsmoker,
3) mother smoker, father rionsmoker, 4)
both nonsmokers. Forty-six families in
which one parent strioked only pipes or
cigars were excluded because the numbers
were too small. The results of an analysis
of variance for residual FEV,» in the four
groups are shown in table 5. The highly
significant differences in the mean resid-
uals indicate the expected adverse effect of
active smoking. with one exception: the
men in the group where only their wives
smoked also had low residuals. These men
were farther subdivided by their past
smoking history. The men who never
smoked themselves (but whose wives
smoked: did not deviate significantly from
normal: the male ex-smokers in the group
had particularly low lung function. In the
families in which only the father smoked.
the mother's lung function was similar to
that in which neither parent smoked.
Thus. passive sticking was not an impor-
tant factor affecting adult lung function.

To determine the effect of passive smok-
ing on lung function in children, we used
analysis of variance to compare lung fune-

tion residuals of boys aged 7-17 or girls
aged 7-14, divided according to the four
parent smoking categories. Girls’
MEF50% and MEF25% were lowest in
those families in which only the mothers
smoked, but differences were not signifi-
cant. When the analysis was repeated for
the subsample of children who had neves
smoked themselves, this difference for
MEF50% was significant (F = 2.65; p <
0.05).

Residual lung function in children was
also studied in relation to their parents’
history of chest illness. Boys aged 7-17 and
girls aged 7-14 were classified into parent-
illness groups, as for the symptom analy-
sis. For the asthma group, the five mean
residuals were lower in both boys and girls
than in the parent no-illness group. These
differences were significant for FEV,» (¢ =
2.08; p < 0.05) and PEF (¢ = 3.51; p <
0.001) in girls. The trend toward lower
function residuals in children of parents
with bronchitis cr pneumonia was not sig-
nificant.

From parents’ answers to the questions
on family history of asthma. we obtained
information on the children’s first and sec-
ond degree relatives. All mean residuals
were lower in the children who had at
least one relative with asthma, compared
to children whd had none: results were
significant for FEV,, MEF50%, and
MEF25% in boys (table 6).

There was no significant relation be-
tween family sociceconomic status and
