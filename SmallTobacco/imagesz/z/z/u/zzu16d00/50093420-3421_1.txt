or suppress antigenic tumor cells before they grow into sizable malignancies. For
this reason studies will be made as described in our application designed to analyze

approaches are not directed primarily toward therapeutic goals but are designed
to obtain a better understanding of the process by which antigenic carcinogen-
induced tumors manage to grow and escape the immune defense mechanisms.

will permit your Committee to come to a final decision on its merit and on its
relevance to your mission.

With best regards,

Sincerely yours,
