This memo reviews the study design and rationale behind conducting a
package design test which includes Leo Burnett's suggested pack for PM
Blues.

While an ad/pack test is planned, a package design test would provide
Marketing with results in a shorter time frame and serve as an early
read of smoker interest and choice within the packaging alternatives.

“The test would follow the same format as previous Blues pack test. 300
full flavor menthol smokers would be interviewed with 75% 18-34 years of
age and 25% 35-54 years of age. The sample would be evenly divided by
sex and size of cigarette smoked.

Eligible respondents would be exposed to each of the three packs, one at
a time, on a rotated basis. Following the exposure and rating.of the
packs monadically, participants would be shown the three Blues packs —
side-by-side and questioned as to their preference and reasons why.
Consumers would then be exposed to a few unfinished ads; more
specifically, just pictures of people smoking, and then they would be
asked to select the one pack which best fits with the pictures of the
people.

Daniel, I will need six sets of packs. I already have the ad pictures
needed for this test.
