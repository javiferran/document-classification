The above quantities are based on best estimates of per man distribution
by area. Obviously, more sampling can be readily accomplished on the
: Jersey Shore boardwalks than in the small shore townships up the coast.

The sampling location will be selocted by the D.M., but dit ds envisioned
to occur in resort and beach areas = with the objective of reaching
largo groups of young adult consumers where they congregate and while
thoy're in a relaxed frame of mind. This would include restaurants,
canteens, hot-dog stands, bowling alleys, etc,

Where feasible, a sampling brochure {currently in use with our 20~-pack
sampling program) would be distributed along with the 4-pack. Quantities
these are available in the Division involved,

Any sample 4-packs remaining, after the major group effort, would be
distrisuted during the normal course of retail work in subsequent weeks.

To insure fresiness, we have been advised that 30 days is the recommended
life of a 4-pack, therefore the West Coast product will be produced
© during the week of June 4th, to arrive on the coast June 13th and the
East Coast product will be produced during the week of June 17th, to
arrive in Divisions by June 27th. :

If you have any questions or comments, please let me know. Legal aspects
of this sampling program are being covered.
