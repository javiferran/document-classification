To answer a key concern of whether Harley cigarettes are
perceived as a fad or an established brand, respondents were
asked this straightforwardly... how they viewed Harley. The
Majority, 71%, felt Harley was a fad while only 24% saw
Harley as an established brand.

Many of those who said Harley was a fad related their
concerns to Harley's imagery; thus associated it with a
limited appeal, i.e., for bikers and younger smokers.

(See Table 6)

A final report will be issued mid-January. If you have questions
in the meantime, please call.
