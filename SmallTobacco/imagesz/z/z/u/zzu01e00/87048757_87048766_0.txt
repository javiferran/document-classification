RE: -~DA ~WEEK T

Attached are some key findings from Harley's initial test market
performance in Terre Haute, Indiana.

KGROUND

Harley-Davidson cigarettes were introduced in test market in
early September of this year. The brand was moderately sampled
and supported by newspaper and FSI inserts during its first few
months.

DESIGN

A 12-week AAU was conducted in mid-November among non-menthol,
Lo-Fi/Low Tar smokers which were further defined by the following
specifications:

Target Group
- Males, 18-49 yrs., less than 2 yrs. of college

Additional Sub-G

- Males 50 yrs. and older

- Males 18-49 better educated

- Females 18-49 yrs., less than 2 yrs. of
college

MRD_ NOTE

Please note that prior to the AAU, Lorillard's Telemarketing
Program was conducting its screening for its two carton free-
offer in Terre Haute. Although no product (Harley) had been
dropped, the incentive post card for the free cartons was mailed
to those who had been screened. There is the likelihood that
some of the respondents in the AAU received the Harley carton
offer prior to the AAU interviewing. Thus, awareness levels may
have been affected by this mail-in offer; no estimate can be
made.
