Subject: Visit to Japan

Dear Sam,

Please accept my thanks for your hospitality, and assistance with arrangements,
during my recent visit to Japan. Would you also please pass on my appreciation
to Koko for her help.

We are currently putting together the samples you requested of the different
pack sizes, and should be able to get them to you in a few days.

I understand that the visit here by Chip Brumberg went well. He has confirmed
that the CV reduction is due to leaf crop changes, and some minor modifications
tp processing specifications have been agreed. This should settle things

down with respect to DIET processing for JT, although you should not expect
DIET CV's to return to earlier levels as long as this blend / crop is in use.

I look forward to having you visit us over here at some time in the future.
Best regards, e

Robin
