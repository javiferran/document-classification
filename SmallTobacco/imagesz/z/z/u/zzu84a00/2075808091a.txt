Subject: Bofetta/Phase III
Ted:

We have been informed that the Aug. 6 edition of Nature will carry an article
by Paolo Boffetta critical of the use of the scientific studies cited in the
Phase III campaign. Specifically, Boffetta apparently makes two claims.

First, that we have drawn conclusions from the studies which are not consistent
with those stated or intended by the authors.

Second, that it is inappropriate to compare conclusions from a meta~analysis
of ETS with single study findings.

Richard suggested that you begin to consider responses to these allegations.
In the meantime, we'll let you know if we learn more about the article and
will see if it is possible to obtain an early copy.

David: I will continue to brief our consultant to get his view on how IARC
might regard the campaign. But after we see the Boffetta piece we
may want to revise the brief. a -
