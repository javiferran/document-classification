Answers to such questions would provide a sound basis, on which to make product
decisions and would guide SA #2 product development efforts. There are thousands of
aromas at the disposal of the product development team. Feeble attempts have been
made to reduce these numbers to a select few; however, the empirical approach to
selection of THE appropriate aroma is strictly a hit and miss proposition. The
preferable procedure would be to develop direction based on consumer evaluation and
then follow that by a quantitative consumer screening technique. This process would
allow definition of desired aroma categories as well as provide information on
specific aromas within the category. Subsequent to such marketing research,
products could be developed with various aroma characteristics. These could then be
used in concert with the newly developed concepts in order to assess a Product/

Concept fit.
