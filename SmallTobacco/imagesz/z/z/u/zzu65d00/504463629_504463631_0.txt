TOBACCO PROJECTS

 

I. __PUFFED TOBACCO

A. Tobacco Studies (Project 185: Fredrickson, Harper, Hickman)

 

Study of the effect of sucker control agents on â€˜the response of tobacco
to puffing processes is in progress. Composites of flue-cured tobacco from
Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia were used. The samples
were composites of the leaves from the upper two-thirds of the plant. Compo-
sites of burley from Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia are
also being studied. The sucker control agents are two systemic agents, MH-30
and the potassium salt of maleic hydrazide, and four contact agents, l-octanol,
j-decanol, cocodimethylamine caprate, dimethyldodecylamine acetate (Penar).
Hand-suckered tobaccos were used as controls. All samples were puffed with
pentane/wet steam. All flue-cured samples treated with sucker control agents
were more responsive to puffing than the hand-suckered tobacco. However, the
increases in the filling value for the treated flue-cured samples were similar.
The increases in the intracellular volume measured with an air pycnometer were
more variable. No data are available for the burley sample at present.

The expansion of stalk composites of 15 commercial flue-cured varieties
grown at Oxford, North Carolina is in progress.

An exploratory study of the constituents involved in the thermo-plastic
deformation of tobacco during expansion has been initiated.

B. Smoke Studies (Project 180: Schumacher, Green)

Study of the particulate phase components of a control and wholly puffed
tobacco blend continues. Four of the 10 major chromatographic fractions from
the ether extract of each condensate have been investigated; study of a fifth
is well underway. Recent findings are shown on following page:
