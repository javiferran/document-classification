II. HOMOGENIZED TOBACCO (Project 183: Neumann, Newell, Best)

As described previously, three varieties of Blend VIII cigarettes
were prepared for panel testing. These included: (1) Whole leaf control,
(2) Homogenized, autoclaved blend (containing Turkish as whole leaf).

(3) A blend similar to (2), but with the homogenized stem component puffed.
These cigarette samples, with and without filters, were panel tested under
-blue light. Results are shown below:

Results from the expert panel have not been received.

Work on determination of the physical properties of our homogenized products
continues. Preliminary experiments on making properties of our products at
different cut widths and moisture levels have been completed;the data are being
compiled. Work on new methods for “quick ageing" our product has begun; some of
the new procedures show promise. Work on VPC analysis of our products has been
temporarily suspended.
