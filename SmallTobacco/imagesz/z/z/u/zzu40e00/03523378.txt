TO: MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

FROM: SAMUEL D. CHILCOTE, JR. —

Every week or two we invite a Member of Congress to address

The Institute staff and your Washington office representatives
on current issues. Last week Senator Ford, one of our industry's
strongest supporters, was our guest. -

THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE

The Senator chose to speak from a text in which he reaffirmed
his support and included several emphatic descriptions of our
problems as he sees them, and his suggested solutions. I am
enclosing his text for your information.
