Letter to the Editor of Personnel Administrator

 

To the Editor:

As the owner of a company with about 100 employees, I found
Lewis Solmon's recent article, "The other side of the smoking
worker controversy,‚Äù interesting. I'd like to share my own

views, since I've had some experience with the issue.

A small but vocal group of employees have pressured me to
either ban smoking or to segregate smokers and nonsmokers.
When they first approached me I considered the situation but,

for several reasons, decided against any restrictions.

First, implementing smoking policies would have required ;
that I take action against good employees who have worked

for me for quite some time. Second, to implement a smoking
policy would have disrupted my company's work process, since,
as in many offices, employees with similar skills and responsi-

bilities work together.

Furthermore, once I took a hard look at the situation, I dis-
covered that the vast majority of my employees were neither

aware of nor particularly interested in the problem.

I have not read any of Weis' articles to which Solmon referred
nor have I considered the economic aspect of the argument on
which Solmon's article was based. But common sense suggcsts
that rearranging people, changing policies, implementing re-

strictions, and disrupting my workforce won't save me moncy.

Sincerely,
