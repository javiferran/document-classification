The filters come out fighting

® New filters coming
® Clamor of claims here

Filter cigarettes are edging toward
their biggest fight yet week, fol-
lowing the latest smoking-cancer scare.

Taking more of the total market all
the time, filter smokes Agure to climb
even faster, observers believe, now that
smokers are back to fidgeting about
their health. Meanwhile, filter folks are
turning loose a clamor of claims in
current promotion. Riggio Tobacco,
which the king-size Regent, came
out with a filter-tip Regent last week
and claims it is the “only one to give
you filtered smoke but unfiltered flavor.”

Da Maurier, a recent filter entry, is
Full paging this appeal: “Start today to
smoke with greater peace of mind...
with the world’s most efficient filter.”
P. Lorillard’s Kent, now also king-size,
says its filter “takes out more nicotine
and tars than any other filter cigarette.”
Liggett & Myers continues to thunder
claims for its L&M Filter and repor.s
sales are soaring. Brown & William.
son is on a rampage of TV spots for
its Viceroy; other filters are shrilling
thaw safeguards to uncisy smokers.
Ant American ‘lohaees. onl major

company without a filter offering, al-
most certanly will have one soon.

None of this advertising, except
Regent's, broke after release of Amer-
{ean Cancer Society’s study on effects
of smoking. But filter makers won't be
long in ig & cue from the study,
judging from du Maurier’s repeated
advice on how to smoke “with greater
peace of mind.” Impact of ACS’ study,
too, will put an edge on competition
between filters. Already Kent, which
has steadily insisted its micronite filter
is the best of any major brand, is un-
derstood to be bristling wver du Maurier
claim to the “most efficient Blter.”

Meanwhile, the cigarette clan as a
whole is making no public predictions
on the effect of the ACS report. But
last week the Tobacco Industry Re
search Committee named Timothy V.
Hartnett as full-time chairman. 0.
Parker McComas, president, Philip
| Morris & Co., has been 'TIRC chrirman
for the past S months. Mr, Hartnett
retired as president of Brown & Wil
Kamson Tohaceo to head TIRC. One
of B&W’s line is the Viceroy filter,
whose advertising shelved its heavy
accent on health a while ago ond now
talks of filter officiency.

Tn taking the post, Mr. Hortuett
noted that there is still no “conchisive

proof of a link between smoking and
cancer” and said “the millions of le
who derive pleasure and satisfaction
from smoking «an be reassured that
every scientific means will be used to
get all the facts os soon as possible.”
Along with getting these facts, an im-
mediate problem for the industry and
Mr. Hartnett will be to determine the
tone of future cigarette advertising,
After the widespread use of alarming
medical copy a short time ago, many in
the industry have returned to talking
soothingly of the pleasure in smoking,
of quality, etc. Question now seems to
be: Will they stick to it in the face of
the current cancer threat?
