AN OVERVIEW OF MEDICAL RESEARCH

Introduction

< oo A few years ago I had the privilege of attending a. previous

"symposium here at the University of Kentucky when appropriations for
tobacco and health research had been received from the U. S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture. Among the presentations made at that time were
several by members of the University faculty and Experiment Station
staff, who provided a very considerabie parade of taient. I especially
remember being impressed by the potentials for modifyimg the chemical
and physical properties of tobacco by means of genetic manipulations, —-
variations in cultural conditions, and by alterations in processing
methods. The repetitive plea of these scientists was, “If the investiga-
tors of health problems can tell us how they want tobacco altered to
make it ‘safer’ for smoking in the form of cigarettes; we are quite
confident of being able to accomplish the changes desixed.” ~

There was, however, no answer given to this question. The -

geneticists, biochemists. agronomists, and processing experts were
compelled to retire without having been given any clear health-related
goals toward which to target their investigations.

uae The inability of health researchers at that time, to provide such

' goals, did not, of course, stop all progress. It did however, compel the
geneticists and agronomists to conduct their studies largely at a descrip-
