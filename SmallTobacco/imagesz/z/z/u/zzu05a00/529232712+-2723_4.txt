SUMMARY

Shipments for the week ending 8/27/99 reflect the following:
- BSGSF shipments on DORAL (39MM)

- Increased purchases by many top wholesalers due to price increase speculation
- Full allocation purchases by McLane

- The L.E. issued 6/28/99 reflects the expected impact of the November 1998 price increase on total shipments for full
year 1999. This L.E. also assumes a 4th quarter payback of the remaining inventory excess. Additionally, price
increases attendant to the MSA (Master Settlement Agreement), and the 10 cent FET increase, are assumed to be

effective 1/1/00. Competitive and RJR discounting assumptions are also presumed to occur as detailed in the L.E.
letter

for the Volume Outlook.

- The Most Likely for Q3 assumes actual shipments through the current week.
