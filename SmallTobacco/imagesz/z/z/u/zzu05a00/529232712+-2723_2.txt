OTHER KEY POINTS/RECOMMENDATIONS

‘The L.E. issued 6/28/99 reflects the expected impact of the November 1993 price increase on total shipments for full year 1999. This L.E. also
assumes a 4th quarter payback of the remaining inventory excess. Additionally, price increases attendant to the MSA (Master Settlement
Agreement), and the 10 cent FET increase, are assumed to be effective 1/1/00. Competitive and RJR discounting assumptions are also
presumed to occur as detailed in the L.E. letter for the Volume Outicok.

The Most Likely for Q3 assumes actual shipments through the current week.
