Fic. 2. A, binding of cytosolic prateins from PC12 cells and T cells to the NEAT site. Ammonium sulfate-precipitated cytosolic proteins from PC12
cells (anes 1-6) and from C1.7W2 T cells (lanes 7-12) were incubated with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the distal NFAT site of
the murine IL-2 promoter, and binding was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. For anes 2-6 and lanes 8-12, the indicated competitor
oligonucleotide was included in the binding reaction at 200- or 400-fald excess. The sequences of competitor oligonucleotides are: NFAT, GC-
CCAAAGAGGAAAATTTGTTTICATACAG; M1, CCCCAAAGACCTTAATTTGTTTCATACAG; M2, GCCCAAAGAGGAAAATGGACTICATACAG;
M3, GCCCAAAGAGGAASATTTGTTTATATCAG. In these sequences alterations from the wild-type NFAT site are indicated in boldface type. The
positions of the NFATp-DNA complex (filled arrowheads) and of a complex formed by an unrelated protein that bound DNA with the same
specificity (open arrowhead) are indicated. B, antiserum against a peptide of NFATp recognizes the NFATp-DNA complex from PC12 cells and from

T cells. The binding of ammonium sul fate-precipitated cytosolic proteins

from PC12 cells anes 1-5) and from CL7W2 T cells (lanes 6-10) to the

NFAT oligonucleotide was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay in the absence (/anes 7 and 6) or presence (lanes 2 and 7) of an antiserum
against a peptide (67.1) in the N-terminal region af NFATp. The specificity of the supershift seen in lanes 2 and 7 was established by preincubating
the antiserum with the corresponding peptide (lanes 3 and 9) or with an irrelevant peptide (Zanes ¢ and 9) before incubation with the extract and
the labeled probe. Antiserum alone did not bind appreciably to the probe (Janes 5 and 10). The positions of the NFATp-DNA complexes and the
supershifted complexes are indicated. A second protein-DNA complex formed with PC 12 cytosolic proteins (lanes 1-5), which was not recognized
by the antiserum, is marked with an open arrowhead. C, antiserum against a recombinant fragment of NFATp recognizes the NFATp-DNA complex
from PC12 cells and from T cells, The binding of ammonium sulfate-precipitated cytosolic proteins from PC12 cells (lanes 1-3) and from CLTW2
T cells (lanes 4-6) to the NFAT oligonucleotide was assessed in the absence (lanes I and 4) or presence (lanes 3 and §) of an antiserum to &
recombinant fragment of NFATp containing the DNA-binding domain or in the presence of preimmune serum from the same rabbit (Janes 2 and
5). Most of the supershifted protein-DNA complexes migrated at the top of the gel as large aggregates. Antiserum alone (dane 7) did not bind
appreciably to the probe. Ab, antibody. D, fractionation and renaturation of cytosolic proteins from PC12 cells and from T cells. 500 pg of cytosolic
protein from PC12 cells (upper panel) or 250 ng of cytosolic protein from C1.7W2 T cells (dower pane!) was fractionated in a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide
gel, proteins were eluted from the individual gel slices and renatured, and the ability of proteins in each fraction to bind to a labeled NFAT
oligonucleotide was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In both the PO12 cell and T cell extracts, most of the DNA binding activity was
recovered from the fifth gel slice (upper and lower panels, jane 5), representing a molecular mass range of 115-130 kDa. Proteins forming the faster
migrating complexes in lanes 7-10 were probably proteolytic products of NFATp. The PC12 extract exhibited an additional band in the electro-
phoretic mobility shift assay, formed by proteins eluted fram the seventh slice (upper panel, lane 7). The positions of the molecular mass standards

(kDa} relative to the gel slices are indicated on the schematic diagram at t

he top of the figure. The ranges of apparent molecular mass eorresponding

to the fourth, sixth, and seventh slices are 130-146, 103-115, and 92-103 kDa, respectively.

assay for their ability to bind to the NFAT site of the murine
IL-2 promoter, most of the DNA binding activity was recovered
from the gel slice corresponding to an apparent molecular mass
range of 115 to 130 kDa (Fig. 2D, upper panei, lane 5), as was
observed for proteins from T cell cytosolic extracts (lower panel,
lane 5). Renatured PC12 cell proteins from this fraction could
be supershifted by an antipeptide antiserum against NFATp
and exhibited a competition pattern with NFAT oligonucleo-

tides identical to that of T cell NFAT... (data not shown). The
faster migrating complexes in lanes 7-16 of the electrophoretic
mobility shift assay most likely resulted from partial proteoly-
sis of NFATp. Both PC12 cells and T cells also contained a
minor amount of renaturable activity migrating with an appar-
ent molecular mass of about 140 kDa (upper and lower panels,
lane 4) that has not been further characterized, PC12 cells, but
not T celis, contained a protein with apparent molecular mass
