Expression of NFATp in PC12 Cells and in Neurons

 

 

Fic. 4. Immunohistochemieal localization of NFATp in murine
olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb. Tissue sections were
stained using antiserum directed against peptide 67.1 of NFATp and a
fluorescent second antiserum. Mature receptor neurons in the olfactory
epithelium (upper panel) and glomeruli in the olfactory bulb (lower
panel) were specifically labeled.

that two C-terminal peptides corresponding to the major alter-
natively spliced forms of NFATp in T cells can he detected in the
neuronal cells by Western blotting or immunvhistochemistry.’
In view of the identical mobility of brain and T cell NFATp on
SDS-polyacrylamide gels and the array of cormmon antigenic
determinants, the simplest interpretation is that the neuronal
and T cell isoforms are identical.

Since this paper was submitted, NFATp mRNA has been
detected in mouse brain by an RNase protection assay using a
probe based on the sequence of T cell NFATp (37). This finding
complements our demonstration that the functional NFAT p
protein is expressed in a subset of cells in the nervous system
and strengthens the case that the T cell and neuronal forms of
NFATp are products of a single gene. More detailed RNase
protection studies might show whether there are distinct neu-
ronal isoforms of NFATp.

The sequence of a second NFAT family protein, NFATe, has
been reported recently (37). NFATc does not contain peptides
67.1, 67.2, 72, or the C-terminal peptides recognized by our
antisera and, therefore, would not have been detected in our
experiments. It is unlikely, however, that NFATe is abundant in
brain since RNase protection assays failed to detect the mRNA
encoding NFATc (37). Further work will be required to deter-
mine whether ather NFATp family proteins are present in the
nervous system.

An important question for future investigation is whether
the fanction of NFATp is regulated similarly in neural cells and
in T cells. In T cells, NFATp is recruited to participate in the
transcription of several cytokine genes, including the genes for
IL-2, IL-8, IL-4, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor, and tumor necrosis factor a, by a mechanism that in-

volves cytosolic calcium mobilization, activation of the calcium-
and calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase cal-
cineurin, and translocation of NFAT+p from the cytosol into the
nucleus (reviewed in Ref. 38). Activation of NFATp in neural
cells may be regulated by the same signaling pathway, since
increases in cytosolic calcium occur in response to electrical
signaling and to neurotransmitters and since calmodulin and
calcineurin are widely distributed in the brain (23, 24). The
transcriptional activity of nuclear NFATp in T cells is further
controlled in some cases by its association with other transcrip-
tion factors. Transcription from the IL-2, IL-3, granulocyte-
macrophage colony-stimulating factor promoters in T cells re-
quires cooperation between NFATp and Fos/Jun family
proteins (38), and it is likely that transcription of some neuro-
nal genes will also require association of NFATp with these
proteins. Fos/Jun family proteins are induced in the nervous
system by growth factors and by a variety of other physiological
signals (25-29). It remains possible, of course, that the activa-
tion and transcriptional functions of NFATp are regulated by
additional pathways in neural cells that differ from those in T
cells.

The experiments reported here document the presence of
NFATp in the olfactory receptor cells of the murine nervous
system and in the PC12 cell line. The cellular mechanisms that
control the activation and transcriptional function of NFATp in
neuronal cells can be addressed in studies of PC12 celts, for
which a wealth of information is available about calcium-acti-
yated, nerve growth factor-activated, and other signaling path-
ways. Insights into the biological functions of NFATp in neu-
rons may be obtained from a closer investigation of the
distribution of NFAT» in the nervous system and the timing of
its appearance in the.developing nervous system. Combined
use of these approaches promises rapid progress toward under-
standing the role of NFATp in neuronal gene transcription.
