DURATION

in order to fully assess this alternat‘ve method, it is
recomnended that three (3) waves of this AIM method be conducted
while at the same time, continuing with the current ("read
slogan") tracking system.

EVALUATION

A comparison of the "read only slogen" and “ad exposure" results
will be made. While there is no gold standard of truth, judgments
based on face validity and reasonable expectations will lead to
the resolution of which system better provides the more reasonable
and useful information. At that point, a decision can be made as
to which tracking methodology te adopt for this purpose.

SAMPLE SIZE & COMPOSITION

Bruskin's AIM service interviews 2,000 adults 18 yars old cr
older in each wave. The samole for the ad exposure would be
adults 21 years old or older who sncke cigarettes. This would
yiela epproximately 875 completed interviews per wave.

Inasmuch as AIM is conducted equally among males and females, a
statistical weighting fector would be applied to reflect the
cigarette smoxer universe.
