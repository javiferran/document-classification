SACCHARIN

Several tipping papers and one reference tipping paper a
sample were analyzed for saccharin. The qualitative and g
quantitative analyses were performed by HPLC. The method
involved acid (0.05N H SO,) and diethyl ether extraction
and determination on aÂ°C8 column (15 cm) with water, acetic @4
acid, methanol (59/1/40) eluent. 5

All results were confirmed by 6C 2 Ms after gerivatization
of saccharin to N-methyl saccharin (2) by M (197) and
fragmentation. Results have been submitted to OC PME

(3) (4).

At the request of QC PME. a rather simple spot test for the
presence of sodium saccharin on TP is being sought. The
precipitation reaction between a dilute acidic silver nitrate
solution and sodium saccharin seems promising. Work is
continuing concerning the sensitivity and the selectivity

of the method.
