WEEKLY HIGHLIGHTS
AUGUST 8 - 14, 1989

* Mainstream and sidestream ’TPM’ fractions from the Beta 90
nicotine and glycerol fate in total smoke studies have been
combined and concentrated in preparation for determination of
levels of intact starting materials (percentage of radioactivity
that is due to unchanged nicotine or glycerol). This is a tedious
process because care has to be taken not to lose any
radioactivity during concentration.

* Experiments have been designed, solutions prepared and time
scheduled to determine the fates of nicotine and glycerol in 3
more Beta 90 protocepts. These studies will start on 8/15/89.

* Currently consulting with Bill Needs to determine the best
statistical approach for evaluation of the data already obtained.
