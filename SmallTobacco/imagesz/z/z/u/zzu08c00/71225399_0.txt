M E PROPOSED Tl

The proposed resolution, which would be implemented through legislation and a binding
contractual protocol to be entered into by participating members of the tobacco industry,
mandates a total reformation and restructuring of how tobacco products are manufactured,
marketed and distributed in the United States:

(1) by seeking to prevent underage access to, and dramatically reduce underage use of,

(2) by confirming the Food & Drug Administration’s authority to regulate tobacco

products;

(3) by mandating changes in the corporate culture of tobacco companies; -

(4) by setting national requirements limiting smoking in public places (with State and
local governments remaining free to set more stringent requirements),

(5) by requiring that the participating members of the tobacco industry pay hundreds of
billions of dollars to fund medical research; public education; cessation programs; health-care
costs incurred by federal, state and local governments; and federal and state enforcement of the
restrictions imposed by the proposed resolution;

(6) by preserving the rights of individuals to sue the tobacco industry;

(7) by ensuring that members of the tobacco industry who seek to avoid the strictures of
the new regime will be held fully accountable for any injuries their products may cause; and

(8) by establishing a comprehensive regime of federal regulation and federal and state
enforcement to implement these requirements.

The principal details follow.

drastically curtailing advertising and marketing practices that have been criticized as appealing to
