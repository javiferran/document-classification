approaching three of two (Olive II (57%) ve. Caster (43%).

on the “very good'=(1) te "not good at all"=(7) scale are partially

confirmatory of the preferance vota,
The average rating generated by the two products ware not stat-
istically or aven meaningfully different (Olive Il - 3.82 va.
Caster - 3,87).

It should be noted that beth products generated above average’
sCOres,

When comparing those tespondents who rated Oliva II higher than
Caster and vice-versa, wa obtain a aplit of 56% to 44% in favor
of Olive II. This split, while not statistically significant,

closely replicated tha preference split,

(SEE TABLE 7)

The relatively insensitive Comparison with Regular Brand measura
ahowed the blends at parity in that one-third of the smokers rated
both blends “better than/equal to" their regular brands,

(SEE TABLE 8)

The direct attributes favored Olive II for having more flavor,
batter aftertaste, more sweatness and better filter.
