SUMMATION

Olive IL tested exceptionally well among Caster smokers and
adequately among the non-Caster smokers,

The Olive II prototype, despite its lowar numbers compared to
Caster, was perceivad to deliver more body, more flavor and
richer/fullar taste. Its only negative was a perception of
irritation among the general smoker population.

Preference for the plastic fluted filter was much more
discernable among Caster smokers than non-Gaster smokers, It can

‘be hypothesized that the Caster smoker's graatar health concern

takes him more consefous of filtration,
Olive II is clearly viable from a product characteristic

atandpoint and, lika Olive I, should be considered for comercial
davalopment, -
