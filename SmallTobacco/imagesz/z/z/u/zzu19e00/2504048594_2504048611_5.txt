margin. (Olive - 59% vs, Caster - 41%). The preference was
consistent among all sub-groups,

After the basic interview had tranapired, Caster smokers were asked —

The monadic ratings aasigned by Caster amokers on the "vary

of the preference vote,

-- The average rating generated by Olive Li (4,95) was directionally
better than the rating assigned Caster (3.70), Note: Lower ts

-+ When comparing these smokere rating Olive II better than Caster
and vice-versa, we obtain a split or Ulive 11 (33%) va. Gasvar
(47%). This aplit constitutes "nolse” in that it likely
occurred by chance and 4s non-confirmatory of the preference

The Comparison with Regular Brand Measure found the products at

blends "better than/equal to" their regular brand. A high number.

(SEE TABLE 3)

The direct qualitative comparisons,as they often do, seem to ba
influenced by the overall preference score and thus reflecting a
“halo effect." With this caveat in mind, Olive II was preferred on
a wide variety of dimensions including taste, after- tagta, ease of
draw, mildness, and filtration.

(SEE TABLE 4)
The “harder* indirect dimensions indicate that Olive II was
pereaived to deliver more flavor, the fuller/richer taste and the
stronger aromatic strength. In addition, the plastic Fluted filter

was perceived as far firmer.
