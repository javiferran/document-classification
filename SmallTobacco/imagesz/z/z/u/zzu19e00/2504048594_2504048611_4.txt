A word should be said about irritation, As sometimes happens,
the blend which delivers more gratification also seems to
irritate a bit more. We don't sea this aa a major problem .

' because, in the end, Oliva II tested acceptably, -

DISCUSSTON

Olive I and Olive Il teagted in similar fashion. Both test products
were highly preferred to Caster among Caster smokers and acceptable
among the non-Gaster smokers, Both teat products delivered mora
impact and pleasure vs. Caster whila irritating a bit more, Neither
product emitted a serious qualitative deficiency.

Byih products appear viable aud should be considered for
commercialization.

Since the results ware go close, the question of which Olive product
tested better is very difficult to answer from standard analysis, To
address this question we are compiling a special analysis which
focuses on a direct comparision between Olive I and Olive If.
