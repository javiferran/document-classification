In addition to the circumference matrix, three other pairs of_
cigarettes will be investigated for sidestream deliveries of
certain components. These cigarettes represent three different tar
categories; full flavor, flavor low, and ultra low tar, all with
the 12% Mg(OH)2 wrapper. Each tar level has a commercial control
companion. The mainstream deliveries for these cigarettes are shown

.s

in Tables IV, V, and VI.

It is also strongly recommended that a prototype with higher levels
of Mg(OH)2 (35-40%) in the wrapper utilizing 100% expanded tobaccos

be analyzed. Selection of such a model is in progress.
