Dear Dr. Taylor:

The Scientific Director and CTR's staff have discussed your request for partial support of the
conference named above. The program contains topics of interest to The Council, and the list of
_ speakers ensures the scientific quality of the meeting . I am pleased to inform you that we will
make a contribution of $2,000 to help defray , in part, the costs of the conference. A check
payable to FASEB in that amount, together with a copy of this letter, was forwarded to the
- attention of Adele Hewitt at FASEB.

It would assist in our record-keeping if we could have a short written acknowledgment of the
contribution. We request only that these funds not be used to reimburse expenses incurred by
participants from the industrial sector.

Sincerely Yours, Bec: ROK, LP, Auditors,

. f Administrative Actions

George A. Hashim
