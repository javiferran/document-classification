AMES TESTING
Cindy Fulp and Sarah Bess

STATUS: Ten samples were tested for Melanie Stevenson (Growth/Improvement of Existing Business
222). These samples were identified as follows: (a) Heritage Full Flavor; (b) Heritage Light 85; (c)
Pyramid Full Flavor; (d) Pyramid Light 85; (e) Best Value 85; (f) Best Value Light 85; (g) Winston King Full
Flavor; (h) Winston Light 85; (i) FL-911198A; and (j) FL-911198B. The purpose of this experiment is to
establish a data base of subgeneric products made with and without cellulose in sheet material.
SIGNIFICANCE: Samples were statistically compared on a revertant/mg TAR basis as follows: (1) all full
fiavor products were compared; (2) all Light products were compared; and (3) the FL-911198 prototypes
were compared. No statistical differences were detected.

STATUS: Five samples were tested for Steve Sohn (New Materials Development 504). All of the products
in this experiment were made in a Full Flavor Non-Menthol configuration using a generic base blend of
G-298. The differences were in the type of G7 in the base blend. The G7 materials used were as follows:
(a) Control G7-1; (b) G7-4 TPD-429; (c) Regular G7-10; and (d) G7-25 [91-073A]}. A current Camel Filter
85 product was also tested. The purpose of this experiment is to establish a data base for heat treating
G7 extract and adding DAP.

SIGNIFICANCE: No statistical differences were detected among these samples.

STATUS: Four samples were tested for Tom Perfetti (XB 113). The products in this experiment were
described as follows: (a) Winston King Size (WKS) blend containing 25% G7-1 with the Tobacco Based
Flavor 440725 applied; (b) WKS blend containing 25% G7-1 with TBF 440725-1 and levulinic acid applied;
(c) WKS blend containing 25% G7-1 with TBF 447327-1 applied; and (d) WKS blend containing 25% G7-1
with TBF 447327-1 and levulinic acid applied.

SIGNIFICANCE: No statistical differences were detected among these samples.

STATUS: Six samples were tested for Patricia Martin and Art Milhous (XA 112). These samples were
identified as follows: (a) Mainstream and Sidestream particulate from XA prototype CT2286E prepared
with an Ecusta TD5504 low sidestream outer wrap, and a Kimberly-Clark P-2540-195 inner wrap; (b)
Mainstream and Sidestream particulate from a market Marlboro Light 85; and (c) Mainstream and
Sidestream particulate from a market Camel Light 85.

SIGNIFICANCE: No statistical differences were detected among the mainstream or among the
sidestream samples with strain TA98. However, with TA100 the CT2286E MS prototype was statistically
higher than the Camel Light MS; and, the CT2286E SS prototype was statistically higher than both the
Marlboro Light SS and the Camel Light SS.
