STATUS: Four samples were tested for Steve Sohn (New Materials Developement 504). These products
were prepared in a Full Flavor Low Tar configuration using the blend H-199. The differences were in the
type of G7 used in the base blend. The G7 materials employed were as follows: (a) Regular G7-1; (b)
Control G7-4 TPD-429; (c) Regular G7-10, and (d) G7-25 [91-073A].

STATUS: One additive from Johnnie Hayes was tested for Nabisco (Service to Nabisco Brands 605).
This additive was identified as TAG A7200.

SIGNIFICANCE: This sample was negative and non-toxic in the Ames assay under the conditions tested.
Sample precipitation was detected at 1000 ug/plate but did not interfere with counting.

STATUS: Eight tobacco fractions were supplied by Julio Munoz for evaluation in anti-mutagenicity testing.
These fractions were identified as follows: (1) N1 [neutral compounds]; (2) N2 [neutrals]; (3) B [basic
compounds]; (4) AB [amphoteric fraction]; (5) A1 [acidic compounds]; (6) A2 [phenolics]; (7) A2N1
[phenolics and long chain fatty acids]; and (8) InP [gummy residue]. All fractions were evaluated for
mutagenicity in the presence and absence of metabolic activation with TA98.
