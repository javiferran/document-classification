SUBJECT: Analysis of Phenols in an Experimental Cigarette Sample
Made With Brown Wrapping Paper and Compared to the
Reference Cigarette, 1725-89 (PROJECT B 451 CMP)

Phenols in the mainstream smoke of 85 mm straight cigarette
sample, submitted by J. H. Bell, were quantitated by HPLC (1).
The sample cigarettes were made of brown wrapping paper. An
earlier memorandum (2) on phenol results for the brown paper
cigarettes is invalid since the sample was incorrectly identi-
fied.

Three cigarettes per pad were smoked by a single port smoking
machine in J. H. Bell’s laboratory. The Cambridge pad containing
the particulates of the mainstream smoke was extracted with 20 mil
of isopropanol from the smoking laboratory. The isopropanol
extract was diluted with equal volume of 6% aqueous acetic acid
and analyzed for phenols. Results of the analyses are presented
in Tables I and II.

A review of the results based on wet tar suggested lower hydro-
quinone levels in the brown paper cigarettes compared to the
reference, 1725-89. The results of the brown paper cigarettes
were not consistent as seen from the relative standard deviations
being greater than 25%, whereas the control showed a relative
standard deviation 4-7%.
