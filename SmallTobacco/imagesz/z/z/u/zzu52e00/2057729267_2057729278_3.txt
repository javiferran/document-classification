POL’s 0397 and 0398 were made in the Semi-Works to evaluate 100% ETOH
reduction in the BTC on Marlboro cigarettes. Semi-Works Merit KS filler was
processed to evaluate 100% ETOH reduction in the BTC. Cigarettes are being
made for internal evaluations.

DRY FLAVOR REPLACEMENT

After equipment checkout and calibration, implementation of the dry flavor
replacement is scheduled for startup June 12, 1991 at Park 500. Initial
production of RLB with the replacements will be monitored by FTD personnel.

Evaluations of the dry flavor replacement formulations in RCB produced in the
Cast Leaf lab are in progress. Production trials at the BL Plant are
scheduled for June.

MONADTC RESEARCH ; oo
Marlboro Monadic Panel: POL 0366 (Winston) has been analyzed. This

is the new Winston which has the new blend and filter construction. The
Winston smokers rated the new Winston lower on liking and less intense than
the older Winstons. Both the Marlboro soft pack and box smokers rated the
new Winstons lower on liking than the older Winstons.

POL 02011 (Camel) has closed out. The results showed that, based on its tar
per puff and tipping paper, the Camel cigarettes were rated as expected on
strength, but not on liking. The liking ratings were significantly lower
than expected.

85 mm Nonmenthol Monadic Panel: POL 02017 (Virginia Slims KS) has
closed out. The results showed that the Virginia Slims KS with a 23.0 mm
circumference was rated as expected on liking and strength compared to
24.8 mm circumference cigarettes with similar tar/puff and tipping color.

POL 02018 (Virginia Slims Lights KS) has closed out. The results showed that
the Virginia Slims Lights KS with a 23.0 mm circumference was rated lower on
liking and strength than cigarettes with similar tar per puff and tipping
color with a 24.8 mm circumference.

100mm Nonmenthol Monadic Panel: Winston 100’s (POL 0575) has closed.

Results showed that no significant difference in strength was found between
this Winston 100 and a previous Winston 100 (0556). Based on tar per puff
and tipping color, the strength and liking ratings were not significantly
different from expected.

85mm Menthol Monadic Panel: Monadic liking results for POL 0478

(Marlboro Menthol BBET substitution benchmark) showed that it was rated
similar to the previous Marlboro Menthol by the total panel and by all tar-
per-puff groups. The supplemented panel data will be compared with that of
POL 0479 (BLDET) when it closes on June 7.
