filter tow with white tow on charcoal-filtered cigarette brands. The four
brands affected are: _ : :

* Parliament 100 SP/FTB (export & domestic)

* Virginia Slims Lights 100 FTB Charcoal (Japan)
« Lark Deluxe Milds 100 FIB (export)

¢ Multifilter KS SP (domestic)

Specifications for Virginia Slims Lights 100 Charcoal and all of the
Parliament brands (domestic and export) affected by the elimination of black
tow have been issued. Meetings were held the week of 5/20/91 with R&D,
Operations Services and Purchasing to discuss the logistics of the tow
elimination program. As a result of these meetings, two possible options
were selected for implementation. These options represent the best method
for depleting black tow without coinciding with the Parliament graphics
changes, while minimizing the impact on normal production procedures. The
logistics for the changeover are being finalized.

the new package design began the week of 5/20/91. In addition to the newly
designed graphics, the FTB packings will have an embossed crest. The SP will
not have the embossed crest. The current conversion timetable is as follows:

¢ KS FTB (Japan) 6/5/91
