Re: Topics on Smoking Issues for West Palm Beach Trip

Moderation

e Provide greater satisfaction in fewer cigarettes per pack so...
that smokers can cut down their daily consumption.

e Increase tar and nicotine in first puffs of cigarette with

the decreasing strength so smoker effectively moderates
intake while receiving satisfying smoke at first.

Social Acceptability

e Reduce the irritation of smoke to non-smokers by adding
aromatics as is done in pipe tobaccos.

e Provide a foreign cigarette positioned to college educated,
affluent, 30-40 year old smokers that will have greater
perceived quality, higher price and possibly be aromatic.

@ Deliver nicotine through filter with reduced tar level in

smoke to provide smoker satifaction while reducing perceived
irritation to non-smokers.
