OBJECT: To study means of flavoring TC devices to further augment the taste
of very low tar (less than 10 mg) cigarettes.

INTRODUCTION: New TC devices have many advantages, the most obvious of which

is lessened tar delivery. The alr dilution causes smaller amounts of mainstream
smoke to reach the consumer. Present TC cigarettes have deslrable flavor.
However, If tar levels were to continue to drop lower, perhaps to less than

10 mg/cigarette, lessened flavor might result. It Is thts possible reduction

in taste which makes the successful addition of flavorants to plastic TC devices
desirable.

PROPOSAL: It Is suggested that a study of flavor transfer from TC devices be
initiated. The flavorant would of necessity be held In a solid matrix, either
on an adsorbent granule or in a permeable solid. The project would ascertain
the delivery properties of mode! compounds such as menthol, nicotine or
flavorants to the mainstream smoke. It would require the services of one B.S.
chemist for approximately 6 months. No new capital expenditures for equipment
would be required.
