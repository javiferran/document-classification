d.
e. Calibration of pump flow rates

III.

IV.

Zero Balance of instrumentation

Possible performance checks

Possible to use one of the particle analyzers (e.g. HAM)
as a secondard reference method.

Standard gases confirmed by independent laboratory method

Site Selection

a. Office space -
ob. Public space
c. Placement of sampling device

1. Representative of space and people occupying the space

Data Collection

a.

b.

Sampling duration-1 week continuous during. period space
is open to occupancy

Ambient sampling of outside air-if CO/CO2 is unusually
elevated during the sampling interval (Day one)

c. Nicotine-as per RJR procedure (time-weighted)
d.

Respirable Particulates (Gravimetric)

¥. Maintaining Log of Observations during Sampling

VI.
