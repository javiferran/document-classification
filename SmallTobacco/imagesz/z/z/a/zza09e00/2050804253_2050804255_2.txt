Symposium of the Experimental Carcinogenesis Section/Heidelberg

Prof. A. reported on the symposium (and a workshop) concerning the
endogenous carcinogenesis, where Prof. Schmidt is said to have
been severely attacked. The organizer, Prof. Zenker, described the
behaviour of Prof. Schmidt as unacceptable in a letter to

Mr. Wille. WPA discussed whether and in what way this statement by
Prof. Zenker might be made available to a wider public.

Report on the Topic of Passive Smoking in Canada

In Canada, the publication of a report on the topic of passive
smoking by Prof. Spitzer is imminent (Summary encl. 3).

Prof. A. reported that Prof. Spitzer had been persuaded by John
Rupp to prepare this report on the topic of passive smoking. In
accordance with the attitude of Prof. Spitzer, this report has now
turned out to be "anti" rather than "pro". The view of WPA is that
it was not advisable to make use of this report.

Date of the next meeting : July 12, 1989, at 9:00, at VDC Hamburg.
