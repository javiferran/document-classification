PROJECT : ANALYSIS OF N-NITROSONORNICOTINE (NNN)
at EE RIMM ELVEN OUNININ

INTRODUCTION

The analysis of volatile nitrosamines in tobacco smoke
(mainstream and sidestream) has been worked out in this

lab using the TEA detector. It is now desirable to have
available a routine procedure for the non-volatile, tobacco-
specific nitrosamines in both processed tobacco and tobacco
smoke. It is also planned to apply this method to indoor
studies and to monitor NINO extracts.

PROCEDURES

A review of the current literature was made and there are
several chromatographic methods available : rucl), GLC2-4)
Gc-ms5), uprcé-8) and HPLC-TEAY) , Although the analysis
of NNN is the major goal, it is conceivable to incluée

 

other tobacco-specific nitrosamines such as NNK and N-nitroso-

anatabin (NAtB). The possible presence of the latter was
first mentioned by Klus and Kuhn!) and later confirmed by
mass spectrometry, for both tobacco and tobacco smoke

It is planned to apply GLC, HPLC and HPLC-TEA methods and
to compare the results obtained in addition to the feasi-
bility to have a technician use a practical method on a
routine basis.
