REDUCED PREMIUMS FOR
NON-SMOKERS

Whether you haven't smoked for a year,
or you've never smoked, there's good
news from INA about the cost of life
insurance. Besides the obvious health
benefits from not smoking cigarettes,
there are now financial benefits.

Government medical studies have
proven again and again that people who
don’t smoke generally are healthier and,
therefore, tend to live longer. They are
better insurance risks, so why shouldn't
this fact be reflected when it comes to |
the cost of life insurance?
