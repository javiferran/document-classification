Subject: VA req. to add clubs on milit. bases

| received a request from Chuck Brady, on behalf of the VA alliance of B&G Clubs, to include the clubs on military
bases in the PM-supported SMART Moves initiative. Funds for inclusion of these clubs would come from shifting
some line items in the current grant, such as overhead. The alliance pledged to absorb these expenses so that the
military base clubs can be included.

As the request adds additional youth to our sponsored initiative, and does not involve new PM funds, | recommend we
support the request to add military base clubs to the alliance grant.

| will send the enclosed letter to Chuck unless there are questions/comments.
