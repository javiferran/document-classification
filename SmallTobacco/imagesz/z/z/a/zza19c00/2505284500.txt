The ex vivo genotoxicity assay (HPRT) utilizes cells that have been exposed in the
intact organism. Isolated target cells may also be useful for other endpoints (DNA
analysis, comet assay)

. Optimization of cell isolation from control rats by sub-characterization of ex vivo Mar.2000
pulmonary cells types (e.g. antibodies to surfactant proteins, alkaline phosphatase,
cytokeratins and surface antigenes)

2. Study the proliferative capacity of type II cell fractions to allow normalization of Jun.2000
mutation frequencies

3. Abstract submission (methodology) Sep.2000

4. Comparison and optimization of mutation expression kinetics (i vitro and in vivo) | Jun.2001
following exposure to a model mutagen (target date depends on starting time)

5. Planning and execution of an ex vivo positive control by instillation of rats with Dec.2000
quartz particles using the same strain and experimental design as in the RASS/DEE
study

6. Re-evaluation of RASS/DEE study data in light of improved understanding of
say conditions

Mar.2001

7. Monitor literature continuous
