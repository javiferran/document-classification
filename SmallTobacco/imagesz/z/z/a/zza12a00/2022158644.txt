Natural Base Filler (NBF

1.

Two large batches of lemon albedo, product C-106,

were ozonated in a large glass column, This material
produced a designed filler slurry of an adequate
viscosity, and it was easily converted into an accept-
able designed filler sheet.*

The sheet was cut into small squares and blended with
tobacco at the 50% level. Flavors will be applied|,
and the machine made cigarettes will be evaluated by
Lab and POL panels.

A medium. size extractor was obtained, and! one pound

quantities of coffee bean hulls are being extracted.
This material will be used as a designed filler base
in a. larger evaluation,
