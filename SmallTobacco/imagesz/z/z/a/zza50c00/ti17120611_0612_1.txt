Tobacco Institute's 1995 Lobbying Expenditures
w=

We have carefully reviewed the Lobby Commission's 1995 report on lobby activitics.
We oan find uo disclosure of $279,700 in oxponditures by tobaoco-roluted clicnts or lobbyists
that matches the information included in the Tobacco Institute's budget document. Nevertheless,
it seems clear that the expenditure was directly related to the tobacco industry's unsuccesefu)
efforts in 1995 to pase a statewide precmption bill. (See, e.z., $.5414-A/1995,}

While we do nat have a copy of the “New York Preemption Plan," we believe that it ie
reasonable to conclude that the plan was devised to influence legislators and, possibly, the public
with tegard to preemption legislation. Therefure, sume or all of the epending should have been
reported lo the Lobby Commission and made availible to the public.

We urge that the Lobby Commission use al! the powers at its disposal, including ite
powers to subpoena witnesses and documents, and promptly investigate this discrepancy. In the
event that al] or port of the $279,700 reported in the Tobacco Institute's budget was spent to
influence legistation and lawmakers in New York State, the omitted data should be made public
itmmedietely a¢ full sanctions and penalties applied to all culpable partics. The integrity of New
York's lobby disclosure laws depends on your swift and sure action.
