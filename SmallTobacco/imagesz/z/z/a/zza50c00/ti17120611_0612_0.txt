Re; 1995 lobbying activities of the Tobacco Institute
Dear Mé. Clemente:

We are requesting that the Lobby Commission investigate whether an epregious omission
in lobby disclosures for 1995 was made by the tobacco industry, its trade association and their
lobbyists. Information made public az a result of the settlement of a lawsuit brought by the State
of Minnesota against cigarette manufacturers provides disturbing ovidence of a tobacco industry
campaign to kil! tebacco contro} legislation in New York State,

According to the 1996 budget of the Tobarco Institute, the trade association for the :
tohacco industry, an expenditure of $279,700 was made in 1995 for something denominated as :
the "New York State Preemption Plan." This item is reported om page 3-17 in the 100-plus page
budget. The liew ix assigned to the Nationa! Headquarters "Spectal Projects” Account. The
budget provides spending by line item for 1996 md includes 1995 spending figures. spparently
for comparison purposes. In fight of the fact that this entry appears in a document dated October
27, 1995, which provides hudget as wall as estimate entries for 1995 spending, indiootes that the
monies identified were actually being spent. (A copy of the budget document ie attached hereto.)

The $279,700 expenditure for the New York State Preemption Plan” is reported
separately and appears to be in addition to routine lobbying expenses reported on pages 3-10 and :
4.14, and in addition to other expenditures including donations to accociated business ‘
organizations, campaign contributions and professional fees.

Preemption by the state of laws and regulations enacted by local government is 3 primary
suiateyy of the tobacco industry ag it attempts to frustrate and overtum efforts to regulate the use
and marketing of tobacco products, Evidence that the Tobacco Institute clneely tracked the
progress of state preemption legislation is provided by a May 1993 Tobacco Institute document
tracking the progrees of such bills in a number of states. (A copy is attached hereto.)
