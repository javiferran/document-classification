MEMORANDUM

TO: The Members of the Executive Committee

     
 

FROM: Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr.

Administrative Law Judge Vitonne yesterday presided over the
opening day of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration’s (OSHA) scheduled 11l-week hearings on the
proposed indoor air quality standard. OSHA staff testified in
the morning; the balance of the day was consumed by a cross-
examination period.

Dr. Michael Silverstein, OSHA’s director of policy, expressed the
Agency’s intent to use the information obtained at the hearing to
“assure that the final rule is effective." Noting that ETS
issues had received a disproportionate amount of pre-hearing
attention, Silverstein stressed that tobacco is only one of many
airborne “hazards" OSHA would address in the final rule. He
denied any political motivation for the rulemaking.

John Martonik, acting director of health standards programs for
OSHA, stressed that the regulation would not ban smoking, but
only restrict smoking to separately exhausted smoking areas under
negative pressure so that nonsmoking coworkers are "protected ...
from the adverse health effects of ETS." Martonik estimated that
4.4 million buildings and 70.7 million workers would be affected
by the ruie. Compliance with the IAQ standard is estimated at
$8.1 billion.

Following the opening statements, nearly a dozen individuals
acknowledged their intent to cross-examine OSHA staffers. The
questions, primarily from tobacco industry representatives,
sought to clarify matters ranging from the scope of the rule to
the research the Agency cited to support the proposed action.
Following one lengthy exchange, Agency staffers stated that the
rule as written does not preempt state and local laws
banning/restricting smoking.
