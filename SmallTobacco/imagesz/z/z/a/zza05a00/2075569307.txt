The computer hardware which will rm the Media Management System is being
installed this week . The application will be loaded and tested this week —

also. If there are no problems, we will begin loading the inventory as early

as next week.

All of the media is in off-site storage except R&D. They are loading the
media into containers and should begin shipments to the off-site location

this week or next. Jon Tabb was on vacation last week and does not return
until 9/11. This may explain some of their delay. -

Jon Tabb, John Ruis and I will visit Seattle this week along with Dan Shinn.

Jerry Ward is continuing to research possibilities with processing the IBM

mail systems.

This is to provide alternative approaches if necessary.
