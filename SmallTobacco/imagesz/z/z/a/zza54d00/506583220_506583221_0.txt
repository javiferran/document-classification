PROJECT: Flavored Triacetin Plasticizer
Study - WINSTON Light 100 Box

TEST: Non-Menthol Discrimination

     
     

YEAR OF REPORT: 1987
NO. OF PAGES: 5.

     
  
     

OBJECTIVE:

 
  

To determine if there is a perceptual difference between the current WINSTON
Light 100 Box product and a WINSTON Light 100 Box prototype which has tow
item made with additional flavorants added to the triacetin.

 
    
 

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION:

 
  

Recently WINSTON Light 100 Box product was produced using either tow item or
box material which had a high level of residual acetone. This product gave
an “off" odor upon opening of the box. The Flavor Division recommends the
addition of flavors to the WINSTON Light 100 Box tow item in order to mask
high levels of residual acetone, should they occur in the product in the
future.

 
     
    

      
 

Discrimination results showed there was no perceptual difference between the
current WINSTON Light 100 Box product and a WINSTON Light 100 Box prototype
which has tow item made with additional flavorants added to the triacetin.

  
     

These results show that the addition of the flavorants will not change the
perception of the WINSTON Light 100 Box product, but does not indicate
whether or not the additional flavorants would mask any “off" odors caused by
high levels of residual acetones.

         
    
 

STATUS:

 

 
 

Sensory testing of the products was completed on September 14, 1987.

   

Brands Development and the Flavor Division are investigating the possibility
of creating products with high level of residual ecetone, in order to "create
the problem" again. Half of the prototypes made with high levels of residual
acetone will have no flavorants added to the triacetin and the other half
will have the flavorants added. These two prototypes will then be submitted
for discrimination testing. The hypothesis being that if the added
flavorants mask the "off" odor the products should be perceptually different.
This test would then be followed up with descriptive testing in order to
describe and quantify these differences.
