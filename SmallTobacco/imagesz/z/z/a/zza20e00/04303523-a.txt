_In-Office Spirometry
Can Aid Respiratory

Disorder Diagnosis
‘In High-Risk Smoker

{ international Medical News Service
BETHESDA, Md. — Physicians: can
" use in-office spirometry, to identify, cig-
_ afette smokers: who have a high risk of
“developing chronic lung: disease and to
diagnose respiratory: disorders, Dr.

, Reuben M. Cherniack said at an allergy’

* symposium sponsered by the National
: Institute of Allergy: and Infectious Dis-
eases.

QQ) | “Every pHysician should measure the

forced expiratory. volume and forced

: Vital capacity. ofievery [adult] patient,”

W | said Dr. Chemiack, chairman of the

department of: medicine, National Jew-

- ish Hospital and Research Center/Na-

\ tional Asthma Center, Denver.

i) | Forced vitallcapacity (FYC),, which is

analogous to systolic BP, and the FEV),

Wi analogous to diastolic BP; are two: par-

ticularly, important: spirometric. mea-
sureiments,. he’ said.

In nonsmoking adults, Fev) declines

‘about 30 mi/yean. In some smokers,,

; however, this volume declines 60-100
; mi/year.
| An Fvc that is lower than normal for
}@ patient's age, sex, and height indi-
;, cates reduced distensibility of the chest,
I usually, the result of a restrictive disor-
der. The patient’s lungs may have been
. stiffened! possibly. by: fibrosis: or con-
| gestion, or the chest wall may Have

' become rigid, as in Kyphoscoliosis.

KR Forced’ vital capacity: may: also: be
reduced in patients with obstructive
disorders. When the cause ofia low Fvc
is elusive, FEV\/FVC ratio, an indicator
of airflow. resistance may be substitut-
ed,, Dr. Chemiack said. /

In restrictive disorders, the FEV,/FVC
ratio is greater than normal, but. the
Fvc is lower than normal. In obstruc-

‘tive. disorders, the ratio is markedly
reduced. In: healthy people, FEV, is
70% or moreof'Fvc. | |

The FEV\/FVC ratio may appear nor-

to pulmonary’ disease, such: as. chest
muscle weakness, chest pain, or cardi+
ac dyspnea. However, the. F¥c will be
low Because the patient: cannot fully
exhale, he said.

When a physician in the audience ©
asserted that the flowmeter is an eco- .
nomical though less desirable alterna-
tive tothe spirometer, Dr. Cherniack
disagreed! Results obtained with a peak
flow metering. device are deceptive be-
cause they. depend on patient effort.

The level of expiratory effort can be
affected by. a wide range of physical
and psychological factors, he said.

CDC, Canadian Officials Will Collaborate on

International Medical News Service
"ATLANTA — The Centers for Disease
Control and Canadian heath officials
have. agreed to: collaborate. on a: pro-

about health risks.

The project, called “Health Risk Ap-
praisal,” assesses.by computer an indi-
vidual’s family. medical history, person-
al biomedical information such as
height, weight, blood pressure, or
cervical! smear; and lifestyle informa-
tion such as occupation, whether the
individual wears safety belts, and eat-
ing and smoking habits.

This combined information is used
to predict an individual’s. nsk age of

Public Education Program on Health Risks

and chronologic age, according. to
Charles. Althafer, director for special
projects of the cpc’s Center for Health:
Promotion and Education.

Under the agreement, the United
States. andi Canada are attempting to:
upgrade their risk factor data and to
share that information and research.

The assessment of health risks has
been in process in the United States

since .the. late 1960’s. Currently, the. .

University: of California,, Los. Angeles,
School of Public Health, and the Amer-
ican College of Preventive Medicine
and the General Health Corporation,
both of Washington, are working under
contract with the CDC to update risk
factor data and improve methodology.
