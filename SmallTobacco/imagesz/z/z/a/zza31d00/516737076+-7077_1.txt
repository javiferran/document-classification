As an additional consumer attraction, the Winston Mobile Activity Unit (MAU) will be at
Firebird International Raceway again. Several key features of the MAU include the
Winston Motorsports simulator, Winston Drag Thunder Theater, competitive pack
exchange booths, interactive race games, and a premium redemption center where
smokers can trade in their Winston wrappers for merchandise.

We will be contacting your office closer to the event date with additional information to
coordinate your activities. The Winston Team would again like to provide Winston
Drag Racing shirts to RJR Sales Managers who will be attending the event. If you
could fax the list of sizes to me at 910-741-6651. We will also need a complete guest
list for the Winston Suite, which should include customer titles and company affiliations,
faxed by February 18. Also, your assistance in banner placement at retail and RJR
product sales at the event is appreciated. If you have any questions, please do not
hesitate to call Rick, Bryan, or me in Winston-Salem.

The Smokin’ Joe’s race teams in 1997 will now be sponsored by Winston with Whit
Bazemore driving the Funny Car and Gary Scelzi driving the Alan Johnson-tuned Top
Fuel car. All Team Winston activities need to be coordinated through Bobby Masten at
910/741-6481 or Greg Felts at 910/741-4747. A raceday honorary crew member is
being offered to a valued customer, so please let Bobby or Greg know their name and
shirt size.

On behalf of the Winston Drag Racing Team, we are most appreciative of your help in
promoting the Winston and Select brands. We look forward to working with you again.
We hope that you will enjoy the enclosed 1996 Winston Drag Racing yearbooks.

Best Regards,

Deb
