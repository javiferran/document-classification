Dear Dr. McAllister:

I would appreciate your considering the enclosed preliminary outline
for support by the Council. I have also attached a CV, bibliography and
copies of one publication and one manuscript. The publication is in the
area of lipoprotein metabolism. The manuscript is in the area of molecular
genetics. As will be apparent from the enclosed study, I am proposing to
combine my previous training and interests into a research program that
uses the techniques of molecular genetics to study the regulation of
lipoprotein metabolism and to determine genetic risk factors for heart
disease.

@ I will be pleased to furnish any other information to you or the
Scientific Advisory Board that may be needed to review my proposal. I look
forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Edward A. Fisher, M.D., Ph.D.
Associate Professor of Pediatrics
EAF/rfk Division of Human Genetics
