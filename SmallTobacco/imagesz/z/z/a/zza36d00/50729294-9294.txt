Abstract

We recently reported that the pineal hormone melatonin protected neuronal cultures from excitotoxicity mediated via
kainate-sensitive glutamate receptors and from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. It has been shown that in rats. a systemic
administration of kainate induces apoptotic cell death in various brain regions. Jn this study, we assayed the extent of brain injury
after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 10 mg/kg kainate to rats, using the quantitative TUNEL technique and Nissl staining
We examined the role of melatonin on kainate-induced brain injury by (a) injecting melatonin (4 x 2.5 mg/kg ip.) prior to and
after kainate injection and (b) injecting kainate at the time of low circulating melatonin levels (day/light), and high melatonin
levels (night/dark). The extent of kainate-triggered DNA damage and the loss of Niss! staining were lower in animals treated with
melatonin, or when kainate was injected at night, i.e. in the presence of high endogenous levels of melatonin. Our results suggest
that both the pharmacological use of melatonin and the circadian secretion of endogenous melatonin during the night may reduce
the extent of excitotoxic brain injury. Further studies are needed 1o fully characterize the relevance of our findings for the
treatment of progressive neurodegenerative processes which involve excitotoxicity and apoptotic neuronal! death.

melatonin may include the scavenging of free radicals

The pineal hormone melatonin is synthesized from {12,22], the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase {20}, the
serotonin by an initial N-acetylation, a rate limiting quenching of singlet oxygen [5] and the stimulation of
step in melatonin synthesis which is catalyzed by the glutathione peroxidase [1]. The antioxidative action of
enzyme serotonin N-acetyltransferase. In the rat pineal melatonin has been proposed as a putative endogenous

neuroprotective mechanism [22].

Direct evidence of the neuroprotective action of
melatonin has been found in experiments with primary
neuronal cultures; it has been shown that mclatonin
reduces the excitotoxic action of the glutamate receptor
agonist kainate [10]. In vivo, melatonin reduced the
extent of kainate-triggered brain damage [11]. A possi-
ble mechanism of protection against kainate ncuroloxt-
city may include the melatonin-provided prevention of
kainate-triggered lipid peroxidation [16]. In vivo,
kainate, which triggers convulsions and brain damage,

gland, the night-to-day ratio of serotonin N-acetyl-
transferase mRNA content is more than 150 [3,6].
Thus, it appears that in the rat, both transcriptional
and posttranscriptional mechanisms are involved in the
increase of melatonin levels during the night (for re-
view, see (21}).

In the brain, the biological action of melatonin may
involve specific G-protein-coupled membrane receptors
{24}, nuclear melatonin receptors [2] and the antioxida-
