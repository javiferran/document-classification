Tore Dalhamn - 'PMO" Patent Application
Foreign Filings

 

Professor Dalhamn's basic patent, dealing with oxadiazole
additives to tobacco, has issued in the United States. Patents
corresponding to that patent have issued in Belgium, Canada,
France and Switzerland. Further applications for corresponding
patents are pending in Demnark, Great Britain, West Germany,
Italy, Holland and Sweden.

A second United States patent, of a related nature, is now
pending in the United States. A decision with respect to those
foreign countries in which corresponding applications should be
sought is now in order. Such filings must be completed no later
than October 30th; therefore, our immediate attention to this
matter is necessary.

I have reviewed this matter with Dr. Spears, and we are of
the joint conclusion that corresponding foreign applications
with respect to the latest U. ยง. application should be sought in
all those foreign countries set forth above in which applications
have been sought to correspond to the basic issued U. S. Dalhamn
patent.

We assume that the aforesaid foreign countries include those
in which there is the greatest cigarette consumption, and to
which Lorillard now exports or will potentially export the great~
est numbers of cigarettes. If this is not the case, such addi-
tional countries as fall into those categories should be considered
for addition to the list. 03726299
