Mr. T. E. Miller
Dear Tom:

SUBJECT: Carlton 70mm Filter with 1 mg. of tar
and .l me. of nicotine

I have checked a number of jobbers in town,
and find that American seems to be shipping

3m shipoing cases from their Durham, N. C.
pliant by UPI.

Most of the Carlton 70mm seems to be sent to
American's main pick up jobbers, approximately
one 3m case per salesman.

J also checked with P. H, S. Tobacco Company
in Houston. They were shipped one 3m case,
American salesmen do not normally pick up
from this jabher,

I have not seen any point-of-sale material
- on Carlton 70mm, gor hav ribution

on the trade. American Tobacco salesmen—arg
selling but it is very low key, an
certainly far from the norr ©
an introductions
Sincerely,
fu
