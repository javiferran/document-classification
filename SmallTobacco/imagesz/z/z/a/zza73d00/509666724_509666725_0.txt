Dear Mr. Eschwege:

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed
the General Accounting Office (GAO) draft report entitled
"Regulations of Cancer-Causing Food Additives -- Is It Time
for a Change?“

The report discusses the Delaney Clause of the 1958
Food Additives Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act, which directs the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) to ban the use of cancer-causing food additives.
According to the draft report, food safety experts believe
the Delaney Clause should be changed because of its
inflexibility; however, they disagree on alternative
regulations to the present statute.

The GAO report also points out that the requirements
of the Delaney Clause are inconsistent with the statutes
mandating the approaches used by EPA, the Consumer Product
Safety Commission (CPSC) and the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA). For this reason and also
because of advances in scientific methodology, uncertainties
about the human risks from low-level carcinogens and the
inflexibility that exists under the Delaney Clause, GAO
recommends that Congress reexamine the Delaney Clause.

‘EPA concurs with the general findings and conclusions
that GAO has reached in its analysis. EPA also concurs that
these findings provide a sound basis for GAO's recommendation
that Congress reexamine the Delaney Clause.
