APPENDIX VII APPENDIX VII

GAO has also specifically recommended that Congress
consider three possible approaches for amending the Delaney
Clause:

1. Set an acceptable level of risk;

2. Compare health benefits of using a carcinogen
with health risks of not using it; and

3. Compare risks and benefits.

Under various circumstances, EPA has used all three
approaches in regulating pollutants under its different
statutes. Other Federal agencies, in particular, OSHA and
CPSC, have also used some of the above approaches in various
regulatory actions. All three alternatives would require a
case-by-case assessment of risk. None of these three alter-
natives would conflict with EPA's regulatory approach to

carcinogens.

Public Law 96-223 requires EPA to submit comments on
the draft report so that GAO may consider our statements
prior to publication of the final report. Technical comments

are enclosed.

We appreciate very much the opportunity to comment on
this GAO draft report.

Sincerely yours,

heoangla Coamrin,

Acting Associate Administrator
