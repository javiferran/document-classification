Re: Project AA Menthol

As you requested, the Brand has conducted an analysis to deter-
mine the viability for introducing Project AA as a 100mm Full
Flavor and Fuller Flavor Low Tar menthol only brand family
targeted at stylish females and selling at a premium price. The
following advantages and disadvantages are apparent from this
proposition:

Advantages

o Introducing AA as a menthol would give a separate reason for
being to both AA and MG. Switching interaction would be
Minimal if AA were the menthol prestige positioned brand
targeted toward women and MG were non-menthol prestige brand
for men. In effect, this action would give each brand a
separate, unique identity.

© Currently, there are no “stand alone" prestigious positioned

7 menthol brands on the cigarette market. Female menthol
smokers who desire feminine, stylish, prestigious image
reinforcement must choose from B & H Deluxe Ultra Light,
Players, Satin or Sterling. All four of these brands have
menthol and non-menthol style alternatives which account for
-89 and 1.21 % SOM respectively (as of May, 1984 YTD). Also,
only Satin offers female intensive image reinforcement.
There is a potential for AA, as a menthol FF/FFLT style with
a prestige, female image, to find a niche among these
stylish/prestigious brands.

e A potential exists for increasing switching gains for AA from
female Berson & Hedges Menthol (FF and FFLT) and Virginia
Slims Ment >1 (FF and FFLT) given AA's female specific image
reinforcen. < (which Benson & Hedges lacks) and AA's
prestigiou: mage reinforcement (which is not available in
Virginia S1 -).
