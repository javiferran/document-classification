e As a stand alone menthol brand, even though we would pull
business from the menthol stylish segment brands, we would
also interact with the coolness segment. In effect, we would
be a "stylish" coolness segment brand. However, RJR
currently occupies 46% of the total coolness segment and 57%
of the 100mm brand styles within the segment. And, the TPT
results indicated that AA source of business skewed high
versus SALEM; a 200 index in the parity cell and a 225 index
in the premium cell. This high potential for cannibalization
versus SALEM would net the corporation less earnings per M
cigarettes sold.

Conclusion

While the TPT confirmed that we have developed a superior menthol
product capable of gaining market share versus other stylish
segment brand styles, the Brand feels that this potential does

not represent an adequate enough share level to sustain the brand
on a long term basis.
