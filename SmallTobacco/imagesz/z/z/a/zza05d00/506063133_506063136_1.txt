Past MDD data indicates that stylish female smokers are more
likely to smoke menthol products than non-menthol products.
For example, Virginia Slims, which is 96% female and 4% male,
is overdeveloped in menthol styles relative to the total
market.

SOM (YTD May 1984)

Filter Menthol
Virginia Slims FF -68 59
Virginia Slim Light - 64 - 76
Total share 1.32 1.35
% of Family 49% 51%
Total market 72% 28%
Index 68 182

The NFO tests conducted on AA indicated that the menthol
product, versus Benson & Hedges Light Menthol 100, was rated:

e directionally superior (88% confidence level) among .
18-34 year old female FFLT 100 smokers.

e parity among 18-34 year old female FFLT 100 menthol
Stylish Segment smokers.

e Superior among 18-24 year old female FFLT 100 smokers.

- Further, TPT results indicated that the menthol product

delivered to the expectations of the respondents. The
menthol smokers placed greater importance on the attributes
which are key dimensions of AA's proposition than did non-
menthol smokers (i.e. attractive pack, brand for style
conscious people, high class, sophisticated brand). The
menthol style had a larger trial rate (particularly in the
premium price cell) and a higher rate of retention than
non-menti:ol.

Disadvantage.

 

Currently ® are targeting AA against females. This

automatic< limits our share potential since we reduce our oO
potential -er base from 100% (total smoking population) 3
to 48% (to “emale smoking population). By targeting oO
efforts ag female stylish smokers, share potential is w
further rec If we limit our style selection to menthol a
only, we ar ‘cally reduce our smoker base even further. >
While the 1 athol share among females indexed at 116

versus the arket, a majority of female smokers still

use non-men ‘les on an ongoing basis. narn-
