1982 Share Among Females

SOM % Index
Menthol 38.2 116
Non-menthol 61.8 92

By targeting AA as a menthol flavor option only, we limit its
appeal to only 38.2% of the available female market share.
Brand does not feel, with this additional constraint, that
there is enough of the remaining market for AA menthol to
capture a viable share and sustain the brand on an ongoing
basis.

e Menthol brands are gaining share among 25-49 year old females
(where RJR has average share development), while non-menthol
brands are growing among 18-24 year old females. In this
younger age group, RJR has a 67 index while Philip Morris
indexes at 173. A greater share potential exists, and there
is a lesser potential for cannibalization, if we offer AA as
both menthol and non-menthol while driving the appeal toward
younger adult female smokers.

e Menthol FF 100mm brands/brand styles collectively accounted
for 5.76% SOM as of May, 1984 YTD. Versus the prior year .
period, the share has remained stable. SALEM 100, Benson &
Hedges Menthol 100 and Virginia Slims Menthol 100 experienced
slight share losses, which were overcome by share gains on
Kool-100 and Newport 190. Share qains on FF 100 goolness

. brands are possibly due to younger male/female smokers, while
-losses on B & H Menthol and Virginia Slims Menthol may
indicate that the Stylish franchise is moving away from full
flavor menthol and switching to FFLT menthol products. While
there is a possibility to capture some of this FF business
with a full flavor AA style, Brand questions the long range
viability of the style given the apparent erosion of the
category.

© Menthol FFLT 100 brands/brand styles accounted for 4.72% SOM
as of May, 1984 YTD, an increase of .41 share points versus
the prior year period. Of this total increase, .28 share
points (68%) is attributible to Generic Light Menthol 100
gains, probably due to the general market acceptance of
generic cigarettes and their price attractiveness versus
standard brancs. Given this price completion, it would be
difficult for the AA FFLT menthol style, at a premium price,
to generate a ‘ong term sustainable share level.
