Castroneves leads

thumbs-up to the new fencing.

“The new fence here is very
00d, ” said the 25-year-old Brazil-
ian, who gave Honda its sixth
consecutive victory in Long
‘Beach. “It’s pretty stiff.”

It certainly was a good day for

‘Castroneves, who ran at an aver-
‘age speed of 86.223 miles per hour
and finished the 82-lap race in 1

said that it was a pretty unevent-
ful journey that Castroneves took
to the checkered flag.

Jt was the first time the win-
ner has led from the pole since
Herta did it in Laguna Seca and
the first time it’s happened in
Long Beach since Mario Andretti
pulled off the feat in 1984. And,
although there were 18 laps-run
under the yellow flag, the closest
thing to a spectacular collision
was when Patrick Carpentier suf-
fered a broken wrist after run-
ning up the back of Max Papis’
car.

But ‘Castroneves said he saw
plenty of excitement:

“It was probably a-pretty bor-
ing race for you guys,” Castron-
eves said, “For me, it was pretty
intense.” co

Creating some of the excite-
‘ment for Castroneves was a fuel
meter that broke on the parade
jap before the race began. So for

-the rest.of the afternoon, he
couldn't check out his dash to see
how he was doing on fuel.

“As soon as the green flag, I
was just trying to save fuel,” he
said.

Doing that would have been a
lot easier without Kenny Brack
breathing down his neck early in
the race and da Matta being a
pest throughout fhe final half of
the race. Brack was done for the
day with a broken gear box after
$1 laps, but da Matta hung
around.

Castroneves said it reminded

-him of when he and da Matta

were battling i in the Dayton Indy

’ Lights series.

“Basically, today was pretty
much the same in 1997 when I

“won and you finished second,”

Castroneves said to da Matta.

. ‘Po that da Matta countered, “I
need to change that.”

- Changing that proved impos-
sible on Sunday, even though da
Matta, who was driving a Toyota-
powered Lola for Newman/Haas
Racing, was close to attempting a
pass several times. Included in
those efforts were two runs at the
end of the straightaway after a
restart from a_yellow flag situa-

. ction,

The-first came when the

“course went yellow after Carpen-

tier tangled with Papis.
