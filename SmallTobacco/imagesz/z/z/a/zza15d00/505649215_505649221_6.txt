Phirt orris

- Mr. George Richardson, New Haven division manager, informed us that
Philip Morris sales representatives were each given 100 coupon book-
lets each containing five $2 off a carton coupons and one free pack
coupon. Each was allocated 50 Marlboro, 20 Merit, 20 Virginia Slims
and 10 Benson & Hedges for a total of 100 booklets. Salesmen were
given two waves of these booklets for a total of 200 each. Based on
2,500 salesmen this would potentially cost Philip Morris $5,500,000.
Salesmen were instructed to use these coupons to convert competitive
smokers.

Morris will conduct the following promotions:
