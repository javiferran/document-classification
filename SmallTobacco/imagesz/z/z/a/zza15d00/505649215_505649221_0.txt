MDD WEEKLY ACCOMPLISHMENTS - WEEK OF OCTOBER 6 — 10, 1986

ESTABLISHED BRANDS RESEARCH

1. WINSTON

Results of WINSTON Lights 85's post-production testing were reported.
This test involved two manufactured versions of previously tested 979-C:
1057-A, a translation of 979-C with a 2% weight increase; 1057-B, a
direct translation of 979-C.

Results indicate that both 1057-A and 1057-B were effective translations
of 979-C. Among competitive smokers, 1057-A was at parity with 979-C on
most attributes including the key attributes of harshness and
smoothness. Manufactured product 1057-B was also at parity with 979-C
on most attributes but had a directional disadvantage on harshness.

Due to recent improvements in the performance of current WINSTON Lights

85's, neither manufactured product is an improvement versus the in-mar-

ket product among competitive smokers.

~ 1657-A shows a directional improvement on harshness, but is at parity
on smoothness. This product also has an advantage on mildness, but
has tobacco taste and artificial taste deficiencies.

~ 1057-B is at parity with current on all attributes.
~ As shown below, both products are at overall parity with current

WINSTON Lights 85's among competitive smokers and inferior to Marlboro
Lights 85's.
