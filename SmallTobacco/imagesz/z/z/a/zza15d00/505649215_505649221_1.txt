ESTABLISHED BRANDS RESEARCH (Continued)
1. WINSTON” (Continued)

The “hatiufactured products were at overall parity with current and supe-

rior to Marlboro Lights 85's among the franchise.

In the event, that the performance of WINSTON Lights 85's declines,
manufactured product 1057-A in particular may be a viable replacement
given its effective translation.

2. CAMEL

e Reported results for three CAMEL Lights 85 prototypes aimed at making
the product smoother, and reducing its dry aftertaste. Two of the pro-
totypes were designed to build upon the positives of Wave I Prototype
944-A, which used an increased air dilution system that resulted in a
smoother product, but also a stronger product than desired. Wave III
Prototypes A and D, therefore, were designed to decrease 944-A's
strength while maintaining its smoothness level. Prototype C uses an
experimental “22” blend which has been perceived as milder and smoother
than current CAMEL Lights and WINSTON Lights products in internal tests.

None of the three prototypes represented a significant improvement over
current product in that two were at overall parity and one was inferior.

Neither of the 944-A blend prototypes had the improved smoothness ob-
served in the Wave I product. Prototype 1025-A had current CAMEL
Light's ideal strength and tobacco taste levels but was rated even
harsher with a still stronger aftertaste. Parity Prototype 1025-D also
had current product's ideal strength level but had less tobacco taste
and the same lack of smoothness. .
Parity Prototype 1025-C was rated very similar to current CAMEL Lights
85 with ideal strength and tobacco taste but the same deficiencies on
smoothness and aftertaste.
