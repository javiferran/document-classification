the median age of Hispanics is much lower than that of non-Hispanics, and the
Marlboro family is as popular among young Hispanics as it is among young non-
Hispanic whites. On an age adjusted basis, Mariboro has about the same share
among Hispanics as among non-Hispanic whites. Winston Lights, by contrast,
does much worse among Spanish speaking people than among non-Spanish speaking
whites.

Marlboro Lights does about equally well in all Nielsen County sizes while
Winston Lights dees considerably less well in the counties that comprise the 25
largest metropolitan areas than in other areas, and is strongest in counties
with populations of under 40,000. Marlboro Lights skews toward lighter smokers
and Winston Lights toward heavier smokers, but this is almost entirely, if not
entirely, a function of the age differences of smokers of the two brands.

If you need additional information give me a call.
