Dear Diane:

As I'm sure you are aware, there is practically no movement of H.B.
Crownfilter cigarettes through your airport duty free shop. Accord-
ing to our records, the last order you placed for this brand was for
1 - 10M case in April, 1982.

In view of this, we cannot justify to our associates in Germany to
continue supporting H.B. with the lighted display in your duty free
shop, and they have asked us to cancel it.

In accordance with the terms of our letter of agreement dated Janu-
ary 23, 1981, and your letter dated December 28, 1981, in which it
was agreed that displays could be cancelled on thirty (30) days no-
tice, please accept this as our request to cancel the H.B. display.
We will pay rental on this display through May 15, 1983, and ask
that you remove it at that time.

We may be able to use the lightbox at another location at a later
date, and would like to have it shipped back to this office. If
you can arrange to ship it to us by U.P.S., we will be pleased to
reimburse you for any packing and shipping costs. Otherwise, you
can store it in your warehouse until Bob Castro next visits you and
he can arrange shipment at that time.

Many thanks for your help and cooperation.

Best regards, on

W.A. Becker NI
