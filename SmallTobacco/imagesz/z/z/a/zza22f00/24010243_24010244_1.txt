Matt and Cliff suggest that, if possible, the establishment of @ smoking section
should just not be addressed in the 6111. Oon'’t say they cannot be established,
but don’t say they cen either. They also suggest that we try to get the word
“minimize” on line 132, p. 2 changed to “prohibit” since cigarette smoke is a
toxic substance. This plus a sentence regarding the health of the nonsmoker
taking eriority wodid make the bill stronger en benalf of the nonsmoker.

Finally, if looked at in the context of the above possibilities, exclusion or
modification of both the discrimination section and the preemetion clause become
even more important. The preemption clause is really erttica? Secause communities
sould not enact stricter legislation tf we begin to see problems similar to those
outlined above. [t is posstble that we could end up killing or severely limiting
the protection for the nonsnoker by passing the wrong statute. The Coalition's
vast experience with the todacco industry, as well as our own, leads us to believe
that the industry would take any potential weak places in HB 18695 and use them to
defeat the intent of the legislation. Further more, They might actively jook for
ways and people to assist them in such an effort.

Matt and Cliff are very familiar with all kinds of tobacco legistation. They have
shown us some potential pitfalls. In light of their analyats, our willingness to
comprom@ise beyond the position we agreed on during the 9/19 meeting needs to be
carefully considered. Changes in wording and getting words put in to the
legislative record to clarify the bili’s intent may not strengthen the end product
enough if the discrimination end preamption sections remain.
