International Tobacco. Operating income for Philip Morris International (PMI) grew 0.2% in the quarter 10 $987.0
million. The gain was largely duc to higher cigarette pricing in certain markets, strong volume gains in Western
Europe and Japan, improved performance in Russia, and a positive currency impact, offset by lower shipments in
South America, Poland, Eastern Europe, and worldwide duty-free,

Kraft Foods North America, Underlying operating income for Krafl increased 4.6% (o $677.0 million. Continued
productivity savings combined with favorable commodity costs were the key drivers of operating income during the

fourth quarter,

International Food. Kraft Foods International (KFI) reported a 0.6% decrease in underlying operating income to
$346.0 million during the quarter as higher overall volume was offset by poor results in Latin America and an
unfavorable currency impact.

Beer. Underlying operating income for Miller Brewing Company rose 83.0% to $86.0 million in the quarter,
primarily as a result of acquired trademarks from Pabst and Stroh, contract brewing, and higher pricing.

OUTLOOK

It is our view that the cigarette price increases taken during 1998 and 1999 worked to reduce U.S. cigarette
shipments during 1999, Further, we believe the extent of the impact on 2000 shipment volumes and operating
income is uncertain. We believe sofler domestic tobacco results should be offset to some degree by growth in
international tobacco volume.

In 2000, we expect domestic and international Kraft sales volume to continue growing al a low-single-digit rate,
Operating profit for Kraft U.S.A. is expected to increase at a high-single-digit rate, while Kraft International should
grow profits at a mid-single-digit rate as the division benefits from operational streamlining.
