DISCUSSION

On January 26, 2000, Philip Morris reported underlying EPS from continuing operations of $0.77 versus $0.72 last
year. The company's EPS results were $0.01 below our estimate of $0.78. The company's underlying operating
income rose 2.8% in the quarter to $3.6 billion. Underlying results exclude the impact of certain 1999 and 1998
pretax items for litigation charges, asset writedowns, and incremental Y2K business.

The company’s reported EPS, which includes the above items, was $0,79 in the fourth quarter versus $0.11 in the
prior-year period.

At this time, we are maintaining our FY'00 EPS cstimate of $3.70 for Philip Morris. We are initiating an FY‘01 EPS
estimate of $4.08.

We believe investor concern surrounding uncertainties related to litigation against the tobacco industry, and against
Philip Morris specifically, could impact share valuation for the foreseeable future. We continue to rate the shares of
Philip Morris a Hold.
