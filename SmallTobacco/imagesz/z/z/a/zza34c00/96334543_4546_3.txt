*â€”Too early in launch campaign to accurately gauge sales.

 

ANY SUGGESTIONS AND/OR COMMENTS... ;

The eight week transition/sell through period for Harley Davidson was approximately 4 weeks too short. In Old
Gold expansion markets, Maverick is impacting newly acquired Old Gold business. Our introductory plan is
power packed. Strong dollar support, coupled with free goods promotion should give us the highest rate of trial
we have seen in years.
