To obtain these figures, Elkins and co-
workers have employed silica gel, which
according to them absorbs 80%¢ of the NO2
present. They also show by theoretical con-
siderations of the kinetics of the reaction
NO-NO2z that in concentrations of 25 to
200 ppm the reaction in the presence of
air goes sufficiently slowly so that large
amounts of NO may be present for some
length of time. They conclude that NO2
scems to be the hannful component. Silver-
man and Husain’? have shown that, while
theoretical predictions based on the kinctic
rate at which NO is oxidized to NOs do
not hold experimentally in are welding.
owing to such factors as ultraviolet radia-
tion, ozone, iron fumes, and moisture, all
of which affect the reaction, nevertheless
the NOgzg is but a small part of the total
nitrates produced in the process.

What needs to be done to help clear up
the confusion surrounding this subject?
There is need for more work with NOs
and possibly with red fuming nitric acid,

which is slightly more toxic (20¢-256z ),
most likely because of the irritating effect
of the acid. The results should be carefully
checked buth for lethality and for possible
NO effects on blood, particularly methemo-
globin formation, on the central nervous
system, and on the gastrointestinal tract.
It is conceivable that the amount of methe-
moglobin formed gives a rough estimation
of the amount of NO present in the mix-
ture.

There is also need for work with pure
NO as a starting material. This presents
a problem, for wher, NO is exposed to the
air, oxidation takes place and therefore
some NO: will always be present. It
would seeth that the critical condition would
be an experimental atmosphere having
toxic amounts of NO without having lethal
amounts of NOz present.

If these two types of experiments are
conducted under comparable conditions.
much should be Tearried and the problem
once and for all put on a more rational
basis. The same species of animal or ani-
mals should be used for each group of ex-
periments, for there are indications that
there is an appreciable species difference in
tolerance.*#4") Sex, age, and strain within
a given species should also be comparable.
