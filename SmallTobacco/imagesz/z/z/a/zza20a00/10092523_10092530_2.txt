In contrast, Flury and Zernik,?" cited by
Patty,3? state that with cals, mice, and
rabbits, NOs in concentrations of 110-125
ppm showed no effects after six to seven
hours’ exposure. Harrold, Meek, and Me-
Cord 3°83 have reported that the threshold
of harmful concentrations of nitrogen
oxides calculated as NOs for prolonged (at
least three days at six hours a day) ex-
posures lies above 70 ppm. It should be
noted that the authors admit that generous
amounts of NO were present. While at
53 ppm LaTowsky, MacQuiddy, and Toll-
man’s®® results agreed with our find-
ings. at 100 ppm, the average time to
produce death was five and one-half hours:
at 150 ppm, one and one-half hours: at
200 to 400 ppm, three-fourths to one hour:
at 600 to 800 ppm, 30 minutes, and at
1000 ppm, 19 minutes, figures showing
much less toxicity than we found. These
figures were obtained by the phenoldisul-
fonic acid method, and thus are a measure
of total nitrate. Valada*4 has reported that

guinea pigs, and rats was of the order of
$32 ppm (1 gm/m*). In acute experi
ments using cats and rabbits, Lehmann and
Hasegawa ® found that at from 340-410
ppm death occurred in slightly over an
hour’> exposure, Tollman, MacQuiddy.

The results found with humans are
equally con-using. Harrold, Meck, and
McCord © found that two men suffered no
ill effects after three hours and 10 minutes’
exposure to fumes from electric are weld:
ing with an oxide content of $4 ppm, the
high reaching 93 ppm. As they determined
the exide content by the phenoldisulfonic
acid methoi, this figure again represented
total nitrate. Lehmann and Hasegawa
stated that at 64 ppm there was moderate ir-
ritation of the larynx, at 100 ppm marked
irritation and cough, and at 207 ppm severe
irritation of both nose aud larynx with
cough and lacrimation. Table 2 summanzes
their results. The figure of 40 ppm at one
time frequently used as a maxrnum aceept-
able concentration was obtained from their
work.

In experiments with rats of longer dura-
tion 9-14 ppm of NOs from red fuming
nitric acid four hours 2 day, five days a
week produced no deaths for exposures up
to four weeks but did cause pathologi-
changes after two weeks.3* These changes
were entirely pulmonary, emphysema and
pneumonitis being present in ail groups.
However at 4 ppm, guinea pigs, mice, and f
tats showed no effects after five or six
months” exposure for four hours a day,
five days a week.38

Observations on chronic exposure in
man vary widely. Patty 3) says, “Men ¢b-
served by the author working 6 to & hours
daily im nitric acid recovery and fortifica-
tion plants, where exposures ranged from
3 to 30 pyr and averaged 10.20 ppm for
periods up to 18 months, evidenced no sig:
