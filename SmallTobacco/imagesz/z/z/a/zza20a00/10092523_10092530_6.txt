OXIDES OF NITROGEN

Indicztions are that small but significant
differences may occur within the same
species. In general mature animals are
more resistant than young, and females
more so than males. Variations from
strain to strain are unpredictable. Table 4
illustrates this in summary.

This review has not attempted to review
exhaustively the work done in this field or
the pertinent Jitctature. It has attempted to
do the following: (1) to give a brief
résumé of the confused situation as it
stands today, specifically naming the oxides
most likely to be present in ‘nitrous
fumes”; (2) to outline very briefly metiods
of determination, causes of hazard, and
pathological sequelae; (3) to attempt an
explanation of the discrepancies appearing
in the literature as to the toxicity of
“nitrous fumes”: (4) to point the way for
further research needed in the clarification
of the problem.

Dr. Harold C Houge assiste! by making sug-
gestions in the selection and arrangement of
material for this review,
