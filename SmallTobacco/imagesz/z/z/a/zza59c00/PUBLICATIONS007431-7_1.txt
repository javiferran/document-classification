mg/dl}, and castrated males (1.0
+ 0.3 mg/d) were similar. ‘The
a/c values among various age
groups of female pygmy goats were
significantly different (P < 0.05;
Tables 1 and 2),

In the £-globulin values, the old-
est group of female pygmy goats
had higher values than the 2
younger groups of female goats.

The y-globulin values for the 3
sex groups ranged from 1.4 to 1.9
mg/dl, The oldest group of fe-
male pygmy goats had significantly
higher value (P < 0.05) than that
of the youngest group of female
pygmy goats.

‘The total protein mean value for
female pymgy goats was 7.3 = 0.6
mg/d}, and the values for intact
males and castrated males were 7.0
+ 0.8 mg/dl and 7.5 >: 0.7 mg/dl,
respectively. There were significant

666

differences in values due to age; the
youngest group of goats had the
smallest total protein value (Table
1).

The female pygmy goats had al-
bumin values (2.1 + 0.6 mg/dl)
similar to those of the intact male
(3.6 + 0.4 mg/di) and castrated
male (3.0 + 0.4 mg/dl). The differ-
ence between the mean albumin
values of the intact male goats and
castrated mate goats was significant
(P < 0.05). The albumin values in
the 4 age groups seemed to decrease
with age in the females.

The a/c ratio values for female
pyemy goats (0.8 + 0.3 mg/dl) and
castrated male pygmy goats (0.7 +
0.2 mg/dl) were significantly lower
(P < 0.05) than the a/c value for
intact male goats (1.122 0.3 mg/
al). The mean a/c ratio tended to

group.
Globulin values were not meas.

globulin values found in the 4 fe-
male age groups did not follow any
definite trend with respect to age.

Discussion .

Results of the present studies
clearly show that the castrated male
pygmy goats had significantly lower
albumin concentrations as compared
with those of intact males and in-
tact females. This would indicate
that the steroid sex hormones are
involved in the stimulation of syn-
thesis of albumin in the body.

The increase in serum total pro-
tein concentrations with increasing
age was consistent with findings for
cattle and white-tailed deer.?
However, marked changes in serum
protein weré not noticed in older
lambs following study in early post-
natal life.*®

Levels of 2 serum protein frac-
tions—a/c and A-globulin—in-
sreaced with ace. This is reflected

by an increase in the total serum,

protein and may be dependent upo’
sex steroid hormones. Values for
different serum protein fractions
and total proteins for adult pygmy
goats are significantly lower as com-
pared with those of various species
of deer and pronghorn antelope.

The higher levels of serum y-glob-
ulin in older female pygmy goats
(3 to 4 years) may have been the
result of increased concentrations
of immune globulins in these older
animals which may have been chal-
lenge exposed with more antigenic
agents. This increased serum y-
globulin concentration was not ac-
companied by an increase in total
serum protein. However, the in-
creased y-globulin values were ac-
companied by a decrease in albumin
values which was not statistically
significant.
