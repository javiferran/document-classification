Kevin,

In addition to the previous request from Joel for information on acceptable ways to store Identification
information (file attached), we also need to tell our supplier if there are any states or localities whera our new
test procedure cannot be used to collect sensory data. To reiterate this procedure, we prerecrult and collect
identification information, check identification when consumers come to a facility to pick up product, and then
coltect data over the phone. We need this Information before our supplier can begin selection of facilities for
our pretest. Please let me know if there is anyone else who ! need to contact for this information.

Thanks
Melissa

Attached is Joel's previous request
