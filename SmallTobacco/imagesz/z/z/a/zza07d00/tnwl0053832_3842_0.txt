Conference Call
Monday, November 26, 1979 - 10:00 AM
A.H. King; R. Scanlan; J. Bankhead

AK: Hello there gentlemen! After our conversations last week I'm
wondering whether this isn't a redundant phone call already.

RS: Well, tell us what you got.

AK: Tell us what you got. 0O.K. Can you guys do me a favor?
Michael asked that we make a transcript of this so that we can re-
cord it or so that we can send it to him.

JB: Can you speak up Alex, I can barely hear you.

AK: Well, that's exactly what I was going to ask you guys to do
because I'm going to make a transcript of this thing for Mr. Ker~
rigan's benefit and we're not as sophisticated as he is and I'm
going to use my little portable mike.

JB: I've got a tape thing if you want me to do it.

AK: No. That's alright.

JB: I mean I've got a telephone attachment and I'll just send you
the transcript. It depends on what you want to do.

AK: Oh, that's alright. Why don't you do it too, then you can
-, check my stuff. Want to do that?

â€œJB: Sure.

AK: Sure, what the hell - it doesn't make any difference. How
was your Thanksgiving?

AJ: Alright.

RS: Good.

AK: Did you guys have a nice peaceful four day weekend?
RS: Yup.

JB: Not peaceful but it was nice.

AK: Ha Ha Ha! I love it!

RS: Where's Dan?

AK: Dan is on his way to Denver on a stand-by flight to meet Mich-
ael to have a management review with Judy Brunelli.

RS: Ah ha!
