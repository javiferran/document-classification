At Mrs. Clinton's Celebrated Interview With Erie (Pennsylvania) Radio
Station
New Ad To Run Jn Selected New York State Markets

Philadelphia, PA -- The Republican Leadership Council (RLC) announced
today that a new TV ad will begin airing tomorrow in selected New York
State media markets poking fun at Mrs. Clinton's recent interview with

an Erie, Pa. radio station when, in fact, she thought the interview
pertained to listeners in Erie County, New York.

The ad is part of a $1 million TV buy made by the RLC in New York State
through Labor Day. Additional ads will follow.

"Like many in New York State, we find it humorous -- as well as
disturbing -- that Mrs. Clinton couldn't differentiate between Erie,
Pennsylvania and Erie County, New York," stated Mark Miller, Executive
Director of the RLC. "Mrs. Clinton's unfamiliarity with New York

State's geography is a legitimate issue in this race, and this new TV

spot is a humorous reminder that she has a very steep learning curve.”

To view the spot and text of the new TV ad, titled "Wrong Erie", go to
the RLC’s web site at http://ricnet.org/Multimedia.asp.

VHS and Beta copies of the ad will be available on Friday, August 4.
