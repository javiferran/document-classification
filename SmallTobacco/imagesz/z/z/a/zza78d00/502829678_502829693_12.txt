integration of group norms in the higher socioeconomic
group. Thus, when the norm is the absence of cigarette

smoking, peer group pressure is effectively applied to combat

' Geviations from such behavior. At present, this does not

appear to be in effect for females of any socioeconomic group
or for blue collar males. More research in this area is

required before definite conclusions about the nature of

-, the process can be drawn.

Regarding cessation techniques such as "cold turkey"
and tapering, it is important to distinguish between gradual
reduction as an end in itself and reduction in preparation for
total cessation. Although it is often helpful to reduce the
amount smoked before complete cessation, tapering shoula be
considered, at best, a preparation strategy. Unless a smoker
quits “cold turkey", whether it be from a 40 or a 5 cig/day habit,
a reduction in amount smoked is difficult to maintain; and it
seems that the smoker is destined for ultimate relapse.

Prolonged tapering periods (over one month) generally en- -

’ hance the procrastination endemic among.:‘smokers. Evidence

suggests that abrupt and total cessation is the best predictor
of long term success. Beyond unlearning and relearning, the
real key to effective cessation may be an attitudinal change or
a conviction that the only way to control the habit is to
completely avoid it. | |
