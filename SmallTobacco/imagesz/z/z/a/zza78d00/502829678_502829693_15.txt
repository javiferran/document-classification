In addition to the smokers who need help are the major- -
7 ity who would like to quit but will not go for help. Self-

A help kits and other minimal intervention may provide a sensi-
os ble approach to these smokers. The AHF Smoke Cessation Group |
has experimented with television and Yadio to deliver a struc-
tured daily quitting plan to large numbers of the smoking
public. This approach might appeal to a wider audience of
smokers.

Thus, smoking cessation programs can take many different
avenues. Millions of individuals are in need of such programs;
if only 20-25% of heavy smokers who are unable to stop by them-
selves, would, with the help of a smoking cessation program,
cease the habit, an additional major impact on the reduction of
tobacco-related diseases would be seen. Smoking cessation pro-
grams deserve and must receive more attention and support from
the me@ia-and scientific community, from the health insurance

industry and from the health care delivery system.
