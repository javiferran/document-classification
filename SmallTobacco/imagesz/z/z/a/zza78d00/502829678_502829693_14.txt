Comparison of the various approaches to smoking
cessation is problematic. While most smoking cessation
results show moderately high initial success rates (40-80%), *
long-term maintenance rates are less impressive.

Studies have indicated that only 20-25% of those who stopped
smoking ° were totally successful one year after they sought
treatment. Differences in short and long-term success rates,
dissimilar definitions of an ex-smoker,.-and irregular

inclusion of participants in the final analysis lead to
Giscrepancies in results when comparing several studies.

We urge the establishment of smoking cessation programs which,
in addition to pursuing ethical and accredited ‘methods,

appropriately report their short and long-term results.

Need for Wider Effort According to a recent Gallup
Poll, 33% of smokers who want to quit say they are willing
to attend a clinic for help. Because at least 75% of current
smokers were reported as wanting to quit, as many as 15 million
smokers might be served by organizeda cessation programs.

Such programs should become an integral part of our medical
care delivery system and could be conducted largely by trained
allied health professionals. Support should be’ providea

by health insurance, although some monetary commitment by

the individual is likely to provide additional motivation.
Cessation programs should be offered by hospitals, by companies
and/or unions especially concerned with the health maintenance

of their employces and wherever groups of smokers can be brought

together.
