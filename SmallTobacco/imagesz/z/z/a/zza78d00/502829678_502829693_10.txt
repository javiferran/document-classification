pronounced in filter cigarette usage because, historically,
relatively fewer women than men have smoked non-filter cigarettes
(Figure 3).

While there are many adult smokers who give up their habit

help. Several anti-smoking options and forms of assistance are
currently available to those who require help, and the search
