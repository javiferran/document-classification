Until the early twentieth century, physical and health

education were synonymous in school health programs.

Anatomy, physiology and hygiene were the educational foci;
and the environmental aspects of the school itself, such as

heating, proper ventilation and cleanliness, were a prime

objective of health educators. Somewhat later, school health

programs reflected a concern for the discovery and

prevention of communicable diseases among the general public,

rather than for health education itself.
In the first part of this century, health education
emerged as a field in its own right. Increased awareness of the

importance of individual health behavior was an educational

- advance which modified traditional ideas about hygiene and

physiology, and led to more comprehensive school health programs.
In the past, health education programs were didactic and

pedantic. Although they focused on disseminating information ._

about what promoted and what hindered good health, these

_ programs were not effective in areas involving psychological

needs.

Anti-smoking education is a case in point. That .

smoking continues â€˜to increase among teenagers is not necessarily

due to inadequate guidance (Figure 1). Between 1968 and 1974,

smoking among teenage girls aged 15-16 progressively increased
from a low of 10% to a high of 20%. During this same time

period smoking among boys remained fairly constant, with 18% of
this age group Classified as smokers. Girls, who historically

have smoked far less than boys, now smoke more than boys.
