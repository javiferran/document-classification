have adequately covered this material. The epidemiologic-
chemical-biological and purely logical evidence available
and the general acknowledgement of smoking’as a risk
factor for disease prompts the question, "How can society
deal with this issue?"

We do not favor the prohibition of tobacco usage;
this is neither politically nor socially feasible.
However, we recognize that young people will continue
experimenting with tobacco as long as its usage is condoned
by society. We further recognize that, because smoking is
reported as being a "satisfying experience", the habit will
be continued into adulthood. Thus, this public health
problem will continue, and the question facing society is
how to most effectively deal with this issue. A plan with
three major components is called for: health education,
smoking cessation and the development of the less harmful

cigarette.

in the schools should begin within a historical context for |
understanding the potential strengths and past weaknesses of
health education. Traditionally, education ‘has been a Many-
faceted effort to improve the lives of individuals; direct

responsibility for the health and vocational Girection of

individuals has been placed in the classroom. —
