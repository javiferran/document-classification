Background facts:

5 The statement Joe Camel is as well recognized as Mickey
Mouse 4s one of the most incorrect headlines in this
controvarsy. The article shows that 91.7% of the 229 kids
in the study recognized Mickey Mouse as the Disney logo,
51.1% recognized Joe Camel as a cigarette illustration -- a
40-point gap. The 23 6-year-olds in the study came closer
to recognizing the two equally, but 23 kida in one school -
are in no way representative of the entire U.S., and the ~
flawed methodology of the survey affected this result.
Also, recognition does not change the negative recognition
kids have about smoking.

0 Dr. Joseph DiFranza, the principal author of the article on
Canel's share of the youth market, has admitted to the press
that there is bias and manipulation in his research on
Camel. The purpose of his work, ha says, was to "give us a
couple of smoking guns to bring to the media." He has
acknowledged that, "None of thease studies were designed to
show that these Camel ada increased smoking among kida." He
outlined the final article more than a year before its
publication, writing a research colleague, "There, the paper

6 ail ready. Now all we need ia some data."
