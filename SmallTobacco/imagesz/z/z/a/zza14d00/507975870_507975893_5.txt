correct identifications required for significance at various

levels in a triangle test (26).

RESULTS

Using this methodology, we found statistically significant
differences between sidestream odors from cigarettes made with
different tobacco samples as summarized in Table 3. Test
cigarettes made with 100% burley, flue-cured, or oriental tobacco
were all reproducibly different with respect to sidestream odors
as established by forced-choice triangle tests. In each case,
the number of correct selections corresponded to at least the 95%

confidence level and in many cases, to the 99% confidence level.

Replicate experiments in which the odd sample was varied with
respect to tobacco type and to specific test chamber occupied
confirmed the results in every combination. Reevaluation of a
given set of pads yielded reproducible differences up to sixty-
five hours after the set of pads had been exposed to sidestream
odor. Sidestream odors from cigarettes made with blends con-
sisting of equal parts of two tobacco types were different from
each other and from sidestream odors from the cigarettes made
with just a single type of tobacco. No differences were found in
sidestream odors from cigarettes prepared by blending equal parts
of all three tobacco types when they were compared to sidestream
odors from the other cigarettes mentioned above. A difference
was established between sidestream odors from cigarettes made

with burley cutters compared to cigarettes made with leaf burley.
