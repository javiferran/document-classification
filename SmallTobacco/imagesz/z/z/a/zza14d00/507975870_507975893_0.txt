Sensory Evaluation of Sidestream Odor
Using Transfer Testing Methodology*

By L.H. Gains and R.S. Marmor

 

Lorillard Research Center, Lorillard, Inc., Greensboro, N.C., USA

SUMMARY

Cigarettes with closely matched physical characteristics were
subjected to static burns inside a modified bell jar apparatus in
order to investigate the effects of variations in cigarette
construction and composition on the odor of sidestream smoke.
Cambridge filter pads moistened with mineral oil and suspended
inside the bell jars were highly effective transfer materials
which captured the sidestream smoke odors. Triangle test odor
evaluations of the exposed Cambridge pads established significant
differences at the 95% confidence level between sidestream odors
from cigarettes made with 100% burley, flue-cured, or oriental
tobacco. Differences were also found between sidestream odors
from tobacco grades within a single tobacco type and between
equal blends of two tobacco types. Consistent with studies of
sidestream menthol delivery and menthol levels needed to detect a
just noticeable difference, no significant sidestream odor
differences were found between menthol and non-menthol versions

of the same cigarette.
