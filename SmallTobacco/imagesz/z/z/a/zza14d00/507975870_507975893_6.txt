Numerous "blank" or "control" triangles were performed using all

three cigarettes made with identical tobacco types, grades, or
blends. No significant differences were found in any of these
trials. No differences were established by comparisons among
different commercial brands except when constructions were
radically different. Neither were differences found when comparing
sidestream odors from menthol and non-menthol versions of the

same cigarette.

DISCUSSION

Perfetti and co-workers have recently reported on the level of
menthol in mainstream smoke needed to detect a just noticeable
difference (28). Newell (29) and Jenkins (30) have previously
quantitated menthol distribution between mainstream and side-
stream smoke. Consideration of both sets of data shows side-
stream menthol delivery is about the same as that amount required
to just detect a difference in mainstream cooling. Hence, even
if 100% of sidestream menthol is captured by the Cambridge pads
in our experiments, the fact that we did not find a difference in
sidestream odors between menthol and non-menthol cigarettes is

consistent with Perfetti's results.

Cotton balls or swatches of different cloth material together
with odor-neutral water as a fixative material were found to give
less consistent results than the combination of Cambridge filter

pads with mineral oil. Sidestream smoke has a complex compo-
