detected in sidestream odors? To investigate this question, a

transfer testing method was developed which permits collection
and comparison of sidestream odors generated from different
cigarettes. Transfer testing methodology has been applied
previously to investigations of odor or flavor contamination of
food by packaging materials (26). In a typical application, a
highly sensitive acceptor material such as butter, chocolate,
distilled water, or mineral oils) is exposed to a specimen of food
packaging material in a closed container. After twelve to
twenty-four hours, the transfer materials are smelled or in some
cases, tasted (27). Our method employs Cambridge filter pads
moistened with mineral oil as transfer materials which are
exposed to sidestream smoke by suspending them inside a modified
bell jar apparatus. By using identical chambers, three samples
are prepared simultaneously for use in forced-choice triangle
difference tests. This paper describes the method in detail and
presents the results of odor evaluation experiments by an expert

panel.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cigarette Samples

Sample cigarettes used in the triangle tests were either all
machine-made or all hand-made. Machine-made test cigarettes used
mMachine-cut tobaccos with a constant width of cut and had uniform
circumference and packing density. Hand-made test cigarettes
("Supermatic" cigarette machine, The Central Tobacco Manufacturing

Company, Ltd.) used hand-cut tobaccos with a constant width of
