cut, and had uniform circumference and packing density. Test

cigarette masses were matched to within ten milligrams. All test
cigarettes were conditioned to uniform constant moisture content
by storage in a chamber maintained at 60% + 1% relative humidity
and (Ser + 1%.) Conditioned cigarettes were sealed in plastic
bags immediately after removal from the conditioning chamber and
were used within two hours. Whenever possible, both air dilution
and pressure drop were matched for a group of test cigarettes.
When both the pressure drop and the air dilution could not be
matched simultaneously for a group of test cigarettes, the air
dilution was matched to within a maximum air dilution difference
of three percent. Table 2 summarizes the physical characteristics
of the test cigarettes used for triangle comparisons. Since the
cigarettes had uniform circumference, packing density, mass, and
moisture content, equal masses of tobacco could be burned by
consuming a standard length of the cigarettes. Cigarettes used
for comparison were ignited by burning a 12 mm length under
suction. Static burns consumed an additional 30 mm or 40 mm on

85 mm or 100 mm filter cigarettes respectively.

Tobaccos

The burley tobacco used was a blend of stalk positions from
Tennessee and Kentucky. The flue-cured tobacco consisted of a
blend of stalk positions from various belts. The oriental
tobacco used represented a blend of various grades from various

producing areas. Cigarettes prepared for comparison of grades

within a tobacco type were made with either 100% burley cutters

or 100% leaf burley.
