varying polarity and volatility. Moreover, while some compounds

responsible for odors are well known and can be chemically
determined, the large number of odorous compounds and their
unknown interactions require sensory evaluation of a represen-
tative sample of the odorous mixture (31). Cambridge pads which
have been conditioned at 60% relative humidity and (Ser) and then
treated with mineral oil were anticipated to capture such a
representative sample. Unconditioned pads were found to give
less consistent results. Both dry cotton balls and dry Cambridge
pads were inferior odor traps compared to these materials moistened
with either odor-neutral water or mineral oil as fixatives. The
precise depth of the pads within the bell jars can be varied

without adversely affecting the results. However, it is important

that the pads not be positioned directly above the burning cones

of the cigarettes (see Figure 3).

Comments by the expert panel members provided guidance in estab-
lishing the optimum fixative quantity. Some amounts of fixative
yielded high odor levels which resulted in adaptation effects
among some panel members. Conversely, low fixative levels
sometimes were satisfactory for some panelists but yielded
undetectably low odor levels for others among the panelists.
Consistent results among all the panelists were obtained when 0.5

milliliters of mineral oil fixative was used.

Spears (32) and others (33,34) have commented on the effects of

manufacturing variables on cigarette smoke composition. Aust and
