Previous studies have shown that anetholdithiolthione (ADT) pretreatment exerts a preventive effect on th
acetaminophen (AAP)-in duced lethality and hepatotoxicity in mice (1). The hypothesis of a mechanism f=
action mediated by a glutathione-dependent phenomenon had to be considered and supports the present

study using buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a potent specific glutathione depletor via y-glutamylcysteine
synthetase inhibition’

Animals and methods ”

v
Female Swiss mice (25+2g) were given either ADT alone (10 or 100 mg/kg p.o.) or BSO alone (0.5 mg/kg i-p.) or BSO (0.5 mg/kg ip.) 3b
prior to ADT (10 or 100 mg/kg p.o.), Control mice were given saline solution. Mice were sacrificed 5 h after ADT administration (or & b
after BSO administration). Cytosolic reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione content and glutathione-related enzyme activities
(GSSG-reductase, GSH-peroxidase, GSH-S-transferases) were measured in the liver of treated and control groups.

Results and commentaries , .

1- ADT effect /

Oral treatment of mice with tow dosage of ADT (10 mg/kg) induced
an increase in glutathione content, and specially in GSH content. A
10-fold dosage of ADT was no more efficient, that can be due to a
feedback competitive inhibition mechanism. There were variations
neither in GSSG nor in glutathione related enzyme activities.

decrease (50%) in GSH content without modification in GSSG. This
depletion is due to the specific inhibitory effect exerted by BSO on
gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and as attempted concerns the
reduced glutathione that is synthesized only in cytoplasm.

This effect induced a marked decrease in glutathione-dependent
enzyme activities. such as GSH-peroxidase (33%), GSSG-reductase
(30%) or GSH S-transferases (35%).

3- BSO+ADT effects

Gest

ADT administration in BSO-treated mice counteracted the decrease
in GSH content and in glutathione related enzyme activities. This
protective effect seems to be initiated with the low ADT dosage (10
mg/kg), but was more evident with the high dosage (100 mg/kg),
since glutathione content and the glutathione related enzyme
activity values were quite similar to controls.

Conclusion

meas ‘ ay punt

- ADT exerts an antagonistic effect on the BSO-induced y-glutamyicysteine synthetase inhibition. This effect
was noticeable with ADT dosage as low as 10 mg/kg in mice given BSOatavery high dosage (0.5 mM/kg).
Moreover, ADT alone was able to increase, in BSO-untreated mice, the liver cytosol reduced glutathione
content. It can be concluded that ADT exerts a stimulating activity on the GSH synthesis, probably via the +
glulamylcysteine synthetase enzyme activity. The preventive effect of ADT on AAP-induced kthality and
hepatotoxicity in mice (1) couldbe explained at least partly by this mechanism.
