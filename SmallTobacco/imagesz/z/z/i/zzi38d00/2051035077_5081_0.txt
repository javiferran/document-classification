Subject: "Gunsmoke" Cigarettes - Star Tobacco Company

 

Star Tobacco Company claimsyyheir new cigarette Gunsmoke contains high

quality 100% Natural Tobacco with no fillers or reconstituted tobacco (See Attached
News Releasey)

The cigarettes were examined microscopically to determine the various blend
components.

The cigarette blends contained up to 19% reconstituted tobacco. Based on a
consultation with Dick Uhl and Jay Swain it was agreed that the reconstituted tobacco g-
was made of large pieces of tobacco stems that appear to have been flaked or expanded

and adhered together by a binder, (Figure 1). Figure 2 (cross sectional view) shows the a
layering effect of the reconstituted tobacco.

The material was disintegrated in water to observe the particle size. Figures es 3 an and qe
4 show a comparison of the particle size of the Gunsmoke reconstituted tobacco’ ¥s v8 Philip
Morris RL sheet. In figure 5 note a "jelly like” film (binder) used to adhere the stem
particles. Further analytical investigation of this material has been initiated.

The blend contained no expanded tobacco or expanded stems. The lamina portion
of the blend appeared overall darker in color when compared to typical domestic filler.
Some pieces appeared charred, (Figures 6 and 7). eE

A similar blend and type of reconstituted tobacco was seen previously in March,
1993 during an examination of tobacco blends Picked up in Canada and submitted by Pae
