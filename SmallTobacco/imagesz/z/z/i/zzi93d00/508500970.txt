Dear Dr. Leake,

Thank you for sending me the interesting results from
evaluation cf 3M's Expantrol V intumescent granules. while ch3
results do net initially agpear encouraging, at least they offer
possible directions for Lsproverent. Some ideas inmediately cane

te 3

- ange the particle size tc optimize adherence. ‘e have
secently determined that smaller particles give Setter
adherence.

- Restrict use of the additive to only filter cigarettes to
aliminate the grit problem. Our results also show scme
filters work better than others in preventing farcicle
migration.

- Bord the particles to a percentage of the tctacco n
"secondary" casing cperation using a water solution

& will be meeting with our tebacco consultant, Mr. Roser
CundifZ, in early February to explore additionai “new” approaches
to possibly incorporating Expantrol V into cigarettes. We would
appreciate continuing our discussions with American Tobaces anc .
thanx you for your interest.

Sincerely, 7 A Va
