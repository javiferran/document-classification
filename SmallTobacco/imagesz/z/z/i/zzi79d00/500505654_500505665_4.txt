In the remainder of this memorandum I will refer to the process described
on December 6 and 9-11, 1967 as the DESCRIBED process and that observed on
January 27-28, 1968 as the OBSERVED process. oe

A detailed outline of the observed Sutton process follows:

Step 3: NO2 Oxidation of Celtulose

Oxidize 100 g. of cellulose as strips (2 mm x 50 mm. x 0.025 mm.)
with 1 gal. of liq. NOg until carboxyl content of product is
93-96% of theoretical (5 days).

Remove product from liq. NO2 and permit residual NOQ on

 

BS9S OSOOSs

product to evaporate.
