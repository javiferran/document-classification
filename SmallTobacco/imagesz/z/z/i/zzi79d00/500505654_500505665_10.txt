l.a. through i.e. above, but will probably involve a different
control solvent because of the toxicity of injected acetone to
new-born mice.

In contrast to the skin painting experiments with smoke
condensate, there is very little background data relative to
smoke condensate available on the new-born mouse technique. This
technique may or may not provide significant data with the
vartous smoke condensates by February 1, 1969.

The preparation of cigarettes for biological assay and chemical
study of the smoke condensate is in progress. The cigarette samples
include the following: |

1. 30,000 CAMEL blend cigarettes

2. 25,000 cigarettes containing 1:1 CAMEL blend tobacco:Sutton filler

3. 50,000 cigarettes containing Sutton filler prepared by the

REVISED process.

These cigarettes will have a 65-mm. filler rod, 20-mm. 12/45 Estron
filter tip, the filler will be wrapped in oxalic acid-treated (10%) paper,
and will be packaged for storage prior to smoking.

If the skin painting experiments are started by August 15, 1968, all]
parties present at the Montreal meeting agreed that it would be unlikely
that meaningful results would be available by February ? to 15, 1969
(experiment duration: 5.5 to 6 months). However, if the duration of
these experiments were extended for an additiona‚Äù eight to ten months,
i.e., to October or December, 1969, the data should be meaningful by that
time. Since these biological data will be extremely important in our

overall appraisal of the Sutto material as cigarette filler, it is
