personnel the process involved in the preparation of the Sutton nontobacco
smoking material. From the presentation of December 6, 1967 and from
subsequent discussions with Dr. Ward on December 9-13, 1967, the process
for preparation of the Sutton material was detailed. From the discussions
with Dr. Ward, varfous volumes and concentrations of reagent and washing
solutions and the conditions (time, temperature, pH, etc.) of various
reactions in the process were ascertained.
In essence, the process described was as follows:
Step 1: N02 Oxidation of Cellulose
Oxidize 100 g. of cellulose as strips (2-mm. x 50- to 100-m.
x 0.050 mm.) with 1 gal. of liq. N02 until carboxy? content
of product is 90-91% of theoretical (6-7 days).
Remove product from liq. N02 and pemnnit residual N02 on
product to evaporate.
Wash product with 2 vol. of 0.5 gal. of 1:1 EtOH:H20.
Drain. Wash with 0.5-gal. volumes of water to pH 4.5
(about 1 gal.). Drain.
Step 2: Treatment of Step 1 Product with Sodium Borohydride |
Treat Step 1 product with 1 gal. of 0.223 sodium borohydride
solution at 25Â° C. for 1S min. Crain.
Wash three times with 0.33 gal. of water. Drain.
