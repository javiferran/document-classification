While most authorities recognize deficiencies in this assay, it is

the only assay available which will provide any meaningful data which -

will permit the comparison of different types of cigarettes. Presumably

the cigarette which yields smoke with low activity in this assay is

“safer” than the cigarette which yields smoke with high activity.

On Friday, July 12, 1968, Drs. Senkus, Nielson, and Rodgman of the

RIR Research Department met with Drs. Clifford Chappel and Guy Marier

of Bio-Research Laboratories, Ltd. in Montreal, P.Q., Canada to discuss

biological testing of the smoke condensate from the Sutton filler. It

was decided to conduct the following biological assays:

1. Classical Skin Painting Technique (CO-1 Strain Mice)

Whole smoke condensate from 100% Sutton filler cigarettes®.
Heptane-soluble portion of smoke condensate from 100%

2. New-Born Mouse Technique oe
This technique involves the subcutaneous injection of material

into new-born mice. The materials used will be those described in
