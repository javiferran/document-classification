Much of the earlier experimental work was repeated using this observed
procedure. Samples of Sutton smoking material prepared by the process
observed in Santa Monica on January 27-28, 1968 were much more suitable
with respect to TPM and smoke aroma than those prepared by the described
process.

In late February 1968, the results of the numerous experiments with
the described and observed Sutton processes were presented in a report®
to Dr., Bright with certain recommendations for simplification of the overall
Sutton process. ‘

On the basis of our results and recommendations, and additional work
by Sutton Research personnel, in May 1958 Sutton Research personnel presented
a modified Sutton process which we will call the REVISED process. In summary,
it involves the following:

Revised Process, May 1968

Step Treatment
1 NO2 oxidation of cellulose
2 Treatment of Step 1 product with
calcium carbonate slurry
2 Treatment of Step 2 product with
oxalic acid
4 Treatment of Step 3 product with

calcium carbonate-magnes ium
carbonate slurry

5 Treatment of Step 4 product with
oxalic acid
6 Treatment of Step 5 product with

glow sustainer and flavor formulation
