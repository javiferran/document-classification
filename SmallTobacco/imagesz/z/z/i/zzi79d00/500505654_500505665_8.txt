This REVISED process was studied extensively and Sutton smoking
material prepared by it was as suftadle with respect to TPM, smoke aroma,
and smoke composition as that prepared by the OBSERVED process. The amount
of manipulation required and the cost in the REVISED process are much less
than those required in the DESCRIBED process.

In late June 1968, RJR Research personnel arrived at the process of
choice for producing large quantities of a suitable Sutton smoking material.
The suitability of the adopted procedure was based on detailed analytical
data (smoke) and on the results of panel testing. The test panel included
Dr. Senkus, Dr. Teague, Or. Jones, and Mr. Harwood.

A major reason for investigating a smoking material such as that
produced by the Sutton process is that cigarettes containing such material
will be “safer” than tobacco cigarettes. Criteria of safety imposed by
most health authorities, government agencies, etc. are two-fold.

1. Analysis of the smoke should indicate much lover levels of

certain components considered harmful by sone authorities, e.g.,
carcinogens (benzo[aJ}pyrene), cocarcinogens (phenol), ciliastats
(acrolein, hydrogen cyanide), than does similar analysis of
tobacco smoke.

2. Biological assay should indicate lower biological activity for the

smoke from the synthetic material cigarettes than that fer
tobacco cigarettes.

In the latter case, the test of choice, while not extrapolable to

humans, is the mouse skin-painting experiment.
