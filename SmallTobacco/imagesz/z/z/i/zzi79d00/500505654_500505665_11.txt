recommended that we attempt to negotfate an extension of the option
deadline from March 6, 1969 to December 6, 1969.

If such an extension is not provided by Sutton Research personnel
we will be in the unhappy position of having to decide on the next option
period on the basis of chemical data alone whereas the choice should be
predicated on biological date as well as on chemical data.

Since the composition of smoke from the Sutton filler is substantially
different from tobacco smoke, the biological data, by necessity, has
to carry considerable weight in any decision to proceed to the next
option period.

The effect of the lack of the biological data on our decision to
proceed to the next option period was discussed in detail with
Mr. T. S. Briskin, President, Sutton Research Corporation in Los Angeles
on July 22, 1968.
