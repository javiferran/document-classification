SUTTON SMOKING MATERIAL

 

In August 1967, personnel from the Sutton Research Corporation, Santa
Monica, California displayed four sets of cigarettes to COMPANY personnel.
One of these sets (70-mm. filler rod, no filter-tip) contained a non-
tobacco filler, the socalled Sutton material. The other three sets
(70-mm. filler rod plus 20-am. Estron filter tip) contained 1:3 tobacco
blend:Sutton material, 3:1 tobacco blend:Sutton material, and the tobacco

J

blend alone.

- A Sutton material cigarette on smoking burned much like a tobacco
cigarette, gave an ash which behaved and looked much like tobacco cigarette
ash, and produced smoke which had a very bland taste. This bland taste
persisted even when the cigarette was smoked to a relatively short tutt
length.

Analysis of the Sutton material cigarette smoke indicated that it was
as low as or lower than tobacco smoke in respect of the concentrations of
those components considered harmful to the smoker by some authorittes. The
components of interest include nitrogen oxides, hydrogen cyanide, acetalde-
hyde, acetone, acrolein, phenol, carbcn monoxide, and certain polycyclic
hydrocarbons. ‘“espite the fact that these analytical date were derived from .
a number of cigarettes much smaller than usual, the results were encouraging.

After negotiation and signing of an agreement between the COMPANY and
Sutton Research Corporation on December 6, 1967. Mr. T. S. Briskin, President
of SRC, and Dr. Geoffrey Ward, consultant to SRC, described to COMPANY
