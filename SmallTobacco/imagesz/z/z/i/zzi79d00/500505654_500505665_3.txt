Personnel from the Natural Products Chemistry Section attempted to
prepare samples of the Sutton smoking material by the procedure outlined.
In a series of seven large-scale experiments, none of the Step 10 material
obtained matched that provided by SRC personnel in August 1968 in smoking
i quality. A slight but noticeable paper-like carame? odor was always
obtained with our samples.

Because of these differences in the smoking properties of samples of
Sutton smoking material prepared by COMPANY and by Sutton Research Corporation
personnel, two of us (A.R. and J.D.F.) visited the Sutton Research Corporation
laboratory in Santa Monica, California on January 27 and 28, 1968, to observe
the preparation of Sutton smoking material by Sutton personnel.

It was found that the process as described during the presentation of
December 6, 1967 in Los Angeles, California and during the visit of
Dr. Geoffrey Ward to Winston-Salem, N. C. on December 9-11, 1957 differed
significantly from the process actually carried out by S:tton Research
Corporation personnel in Santa Monica, California on January 27 and 28, 1968.

Not only was the sequence of steps different, but concentrations and volumes

of reagents and volumes of wash solvents and solutions were different.
