Re: PHOENIX METRO - TUCSON INCLUSION

I've had a chance to review all pertinent data regarding
the inclusion of Tucson into the Phoenix Metro definition
and I recommend we remain as previously agreed -- that
being Metro Phoenix defined as Maricopa County.

Rationale

Without going into deep specifics, the reasoning in support
of my recommendation is:

a. Phoenix and Tucson are separate media buys,
hence, no reason to include Tucson from a
media purchase standpoint.

b. As Jack Grossman pointed out in his document
to you on 9/1, the markets are extremely
similar with regard to demographic makeup;
hence, what problems/opportunities we identify
demographically for Phoenix should be trans-
ferable to the Tucson market.

- Both markets are growing at an, above-
average rate -- 30%+ last 10 years.

~- Both are nearly identical in % popula-
tion under 35: Phoenix 59.9%, Tucson
59.1%.

- Both have equal splits as to males/
females: Phoenix 49% to 51%, Tucson
49% to 51%.

- Both are equally similar as to house-
hold income: in the $10,000-$20,000 _
range, Phoenix 41%, Tucson 39%.

~ Both are very similar as to educational
attainment.
