c. Information contained in the booklets you
attached to your recent memo confirm the
above and generally point out the overall
similarities of the two markets.

Obviously, there are differences, two major ones being
percent ethnic makeup -- Tucson having significantly
more Mexican/Americans and Phoenix being more indus-
trialized; hence, more of the working population in

this occupation. However, any conclusions reached in
these areas for Phoenix are still applicable for Tucson
in my judgment; adjustments in promotion/merchandising
or what-have-you being made at Division Management level.

In sum, I see no evidence supporting the inclusion of
Pima County to our Metro definition. In fact, the
evidence indicates that such a decision could actually
have the effect of diluting our efforts in this assign-
ment overall.
