To: Dr. J. D. Woods From: Ronald Sells

Project No.: 2938

Project Title: Product Evaluation Service for MRD

These cigarettes were manufactured in April, 1977 at Durham and are from
the California market. These are the first Carlton 100's to be examined,
The pack advertises 5 mgs. tar and 0.5 mg. nicotine.

The total cigarette length is approximately 100 mm. and includes a 27 mn.
cellulose acetate filter plug which has a denier of 3.1 with an "I" cross
section. The tipping is 32 mm. of white paper which is perforated by 2 rows
of 27 each. The cigarette paper is not perforated and is a low porosity type.

The blend consists of burley, flue-cured, turkish, and G-7 with an average
of 37.2 percent of these tobaccos being expanded.

The cigarettes smoke mild and with a weak tobacco flavor. The top note is
a slightly high level of a sweet, coumarin-like flavor which is characteristic
of several other American products. The cigarettes have considerably more taste
than the 85 mm. version, however, the flavor is still somewhat flat. The over-
all smoking qualities are rated fair.
