Our standard technique of qualitative evaluation calls for consumers to evaluate
Cigarette A (five packs) andi then check nine characteristics, such as:

“How did your mouth feel after smoking the cigarette:

Too Dry []
Too Moist {_]
About Right [_] "

Later, after smoking Cigarette B (five packs) they answer the same questions for B,

Our standardi report shows:

Brand A ‘Brand B We Report

Too dry. Too dry No: Difference
Too. moist Too moist No Difference
About right About right No Difference
Too dry Too. moist A is drier
Too dry About right A is drier
Too moist Too dry B is drier
Too moist About right B is drier
About right Too dry B is drier
About right Too moist Ais drier

Thus we convert monadic ratings to a paired comparison type report.

Except for situations where the products are remarkably different, we usually find
the bulk of the answers in the "No Difference" column. Some of the built-in
sensitivity of the test is thus lost.

Proposed Qualitative Evaluation

Leaving the overall preference as it is reported now "Which of the two cigarettes
do: you prefer?", it is recommended that the qualitative evaluation be handled as
follows:

1. We should concentrate on the 18 negative attributes we now ask. After all, these
are the items we want to try and correct if they can be corrected.

2. We should report all the negative data (which we do not now do). That is, we
should report the percentage of testers who report that each product is:

Too mild

Too strong

Too moist

Not sweet enough

Bums too slowly

Burns too rapidly

Tobacco flavor too rich
Tobacco flavor not rich enough
