3. We should also report the extent to which each negative attribute is correlated
with product preference or rejection,

Example: From test 2207/2208 - reaction of filter smokers to Production Marlboro,

4 Complainers
Who Preferred % Non-Complainers

Marlboro Who Preferred Negative
Complaint 4 Complaining Anyway Marlboro _ Pull %
Aroma too Strong 23 11 48 ~-37
Burns too Fast 20 37 41 - 4

These two items were among the more common complaints raised about Marlboro in this
test. Note that they were both reported about equally ofiten (23%, 20%).

The next column shows that 11% of those who found Marlboro's aroma was too strong,
preferred it anyway. The balance, 89% (100% - 11%) rejected the product.

Among those who complained that Marlboro burned too fast, 37% of them preferred it
anyway (and 63% rejected it).

For comparison, the next column shows the preference for Marlboro among those who
did not raise these complaints. That is, 48% of those who did not complain about

the aroma, preferred Marlboro, and 41% of those who didi not complain that it burned
too fast, preferred it.

The last column shows the number of points of preference lost among those who made
each complaint as compared with those who did not complain. Thus, the aroma being
found too: strong, is associated with a loss of 37 points of preference (48-11).

The complaint of "burning too fast" made little difference in preference -- only
four points lost.

 

Thus, despite the near-equal frequency of expressing the complaints, smokers evidently
give more weight in their preference to aroma than to speed of burning.
