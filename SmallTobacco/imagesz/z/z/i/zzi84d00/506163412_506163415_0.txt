Approach to the Smoke Chemistry of the NEW CIGARETTE:

A critical element in the determination of the potential biologi-
cal activity of NEW CIGARETTE smoke is the smoke chemistry.
Initial studies indicate that the NEW CIGARETTE smoke is simpler

than smoke from other cigarettes, consistent with prediction
based upon product design.

The determination of NEW CIGARETTE aerosol chemistry is founded
upon biological relevance using risk assessment. This results in
a three phase program. Phase I consisted of the quantitative
determination of the levels of specific "target" compounds.
Quantitation utilizes the best available methodology. Phase II
consisted of a semi-qualitative and quantitative determination of
NEW CIGARETTE smoke constituents that occur at or above a level
of 0.5 micrograms per cigarette. The 0.5 microgram per cigarette
level was based upon risk assessment. Phase III analysis repre-
sents the determination of the classical "Federal Trade Commis-â€”

sion type" cigarette smoke parameters measuring "tar", nicotine
and carbon monoxide.

Smoke analysis concentrates on the "Tox Model" prototypes.
Analysis is at R. J. Reynolds with specific analysis being
performed at contract laboratories qualified for that analysis.

As with the biological studies the 1R4F reference cigarette is
used for comparison.
