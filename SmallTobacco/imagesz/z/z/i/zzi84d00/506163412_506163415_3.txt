As previously stated, compounds are included on the Target
List to address specific allegations without consideration of
their likelihood of occurrence in smoke from the NEW CIGA-
RETTE. The likelihood of a significant occurrence of some
compounds is extremely low due to the configuration and
components of the NEW CIGARETTE. To assist in setting priori-
ties for analytical methodology development, the Target
Compounds have been broken into two priorities. The lowest
priority list is presented below:
