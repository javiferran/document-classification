potential of specific materials, such as the alumina and glass
fibers, to transfer to the smoke of the cigarette.

The list of target compounds is not considered to be static and
is subject to modification, especially the addition of specific
chemicals. Every chemical on the list does not have the same
priority for determination. Since the compounds on the target
list require careful quantitation, in many cases methodology will
have to be developed and validated. This is a time and resource
consuming activity and as a consequence priorities have to be
set. For example, boron was added to the list to assist in the
determination of the potential transfer of glass fibers to the
aerosol. This is also tracked by silicon determination. There-
fore, boron has a lower priority than silicon. Additional
examples are chromium IV, lead and cadmium among others that do
not have an obvious source in NEW CIGARETTE but are on the list
to address specific allegations.
