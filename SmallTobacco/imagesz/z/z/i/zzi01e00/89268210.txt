NOVEMBER 21, 1993

The structure. however — the smail
‘arms. tne cooperatives. the warehouses
and work organizations — will remain.
And if anyone has a shred of sense. the
weo of farms and co-ops that have held
together much of the rural southeast for
the last 70 years will be put to other
productive uses.

That can happen. At least, that’s what
a.group of farmers, economists and burley
cooperative leaders thought when they
first gathered last spring at a meeting”
called by Berea’s Community Farm Alli-
ance. Since then. the group has been
knitting together pieces of the future.

The group has produced the outline of
a plan. a 27-page document being quietly
cwrcuiated around the South. Lrorucaily, the
proposal depends on the Clinton heaith
pian, the one that cails for a massive new
ax on tobacco. Part or that money couid
‘shouid. farmers say) go back to topacco
counties. Depending on which proposal
‘winds up in the Clinton packages, tobacco
counties couid receive more than 31 billion
a year.

So this is the question: Given $1 billion
a year. how can tobacco farmers and
communities buiid new economies? How
can tobacco counties survive as the de-
mand for tobacco slackens’

The study does mot claim there is any
singie crop that can repiace tobacco. Too
much time has been wasted on this de-
bate. There isn't any new muracie crop.
The best the government can do is set up
a system where innovative farmers and
communities can find new ways Io use
their assets to make money.

Under this plan. tax receipts wou:
into a tobacco community trust fund.
investment authonty, working with t:
existing co-ops, would decide how to
tribute the money.

The money would flow to tobaccc
counties in severai wavs. A farmer or
groups of farmers couid appiy for ioar.
grants to deveiop a new agriculturai ::
structure —- for exampie. conversion .
existing tobacco warehouses to packir.
cooling taciiities for other crops. (The
report lists dozens of possible venture.

Other money wouid go for researc:
for loan guarantees for agncuiturally -
‘ated projects and for community pian
ning. Or. farmers could ask the author
to buy out their tobacco quotas. (Farm.
taking buy-outs would be required to
reinvest that money on the farm or in
community.)

The pian 1s a good one because it
builds on the structures that already e
in tobacco country, the co-ops and farr
{It also directs money specifically to su
Sort farm counnes. And it encourages
local ininatve. in the end, after all. if
tobacco country “iii be saved, tobaccc
farmers wiii have to do the saving.

Those are the ingredients ot good :
‘ong-lasung development. Now. it just
needs to be passed by Congress.
