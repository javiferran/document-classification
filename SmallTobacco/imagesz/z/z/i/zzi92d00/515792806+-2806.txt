Attached is a MDD report covaring the aforementioned subject. .
Last January, a report was issued on this subject that indicated
that Philip Morris had a total share of 59 among 14-17 year old
amokers, and specifically, Marlboro had a 52.share. This latest
report indicates that Philip Morris' corporate share has increased
by about 4 points; howevar, Marlboro remaing the same at 52,

   

Importantly, the report further indicates that RIR continues to
gradually declina, and batween the spring and fal) 1979 periods,
RIR's tefal share declined from 21.3 to 19.9.

Hopefully, our various planned activities that will be implemented
