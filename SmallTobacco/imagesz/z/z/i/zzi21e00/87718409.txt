MEMORANDUM TO THE FILE:
Tobacco Institute Executive Committee

At the 1/17/90 meeting of the TI Executive Committee
in California, the Plan outlined in the attachment was
presented, discussed and approved.

Pursuant to instructions from Mr. A. Tisch, who was
not in attendance, I questioned at length, and in detail, the
extent to which any of the proposed $6,649,000 budget, which
includes a $1,000,000 contingency, could be met from already
budgeted 1990 TI programs. After lengthy discussion, and
responses from Mr. Chilcote that the overall costs could
possibly be less if extensive telephone banks and some polling
research were not to become necessary, the program was
approved.

Mr. Johnston, as Chairman, indicated that as costs for
the program are developed and assigned, the Staff is
instructed to make a good faith effort to allocate some of the
costs to existing budget slots. The latter assurance was
given in response to my strenuous urging tht the costs be met
through the existing budget. Those demands were made by me at
Mr. Tisch’s instructions, with the understanding that if I
failed to convince the TIEC membership to our view, I was
authorized to vote for the project as a special assessment,
"out of budget" program. I did so vote.

I requested Mr. Johnston to telephone Mr. Tisch upon
his return from California to discuss the Executive
Committee’s deliberations, and informed Mr. Tisch of the
Committee’s actions during a discussion with him on 1/22/90.
