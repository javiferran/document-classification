1 want to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules today to meet with our Worldwide Records Management
guest from PMI. They told me that the information and insight you provided will be invaluable when they embark on the
same project that you have helped me with during the past year. As always, | really appreciate your help. This is an
excellent example of demonstrating the company value ” Sharing with Others”. Thanks again, Lewis
