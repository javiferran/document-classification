Subject: Expanded Tobacco Monthly Summary - December, 1970

Routine determinations continue on impregnated and

expanded NH3/CO2 treated tobacco. A second TC detector
and power supply has been received. to help decrease the

turn-around time on samples.
This new unit. has been temporarily modified for

determinations of Hz in the expansion tower effiluent gases.
The limit of detection for Hz in the gas is about 20: ppm.

Preliminary results. on computer output for the CO»,
analyses indicate a significant time saving and increased

accuracy.
