EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

WINSTON Ultra Lights 85/Merit Ultra Lights 85
1982 Competitive Product Test
(MDD #82-31105)

 

Background

This competitive product test was conducted in late March, 1982,
to provide an assessment of current WINSTON's Ultra Lights 85
performance relative to its marketing action standards. The
previous competitive test (August, 1981) showed WINSTON Ultra
Lights 85 to be at parity with Merit Ultra Lights 85 among the
current action standard smokers. This previous test was fielded
when WINSTON Ultra Lights had white tipping versus Merit's cork
tipping. The WINSTON Ultra Lights tested for this report is the
new product with cork tipping and a new blend which began pro-
duction in late February, 1982.

improved by increasing strength, smoothness, and tobacco taste.
