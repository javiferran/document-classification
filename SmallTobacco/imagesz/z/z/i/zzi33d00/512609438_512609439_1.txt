of the test population) of 2 g/kg and a 7 hour C59 (lethal vapor concentra-
tion to 50% of the test population) of 15,000 ppm in rats (ACGIH, Documenta-
tion of the Threshold Limit Values and Biological Indices of Exposure, 5th
Edition, 1986). In studies with rats and mice, an increase in the incidence
of cancer was noted after high dose chronic exposures. Hamsters did not dem-
onstrate this effect. Chronic exposure to high doses of dichloromethane also
caused fatty degeneration and vacuolization of the liver, No epidemological
Study involving humans has shown that chronic exposure to dichloromethane has
resulted in an increase in any type of cancer, however, based on the results
of animal studies, it is a Suspected human carcinogen. Dichloromethane is
metabolized to carbon monoxide (CO). Increased blood carboxyhemoglobin levels
have been reported in workers exposed to dichloromethane. The ACGIH has es-
tablished a TLV of 50 ppm in the workplace to provide a margin of safety in
preventing liver damage and reduce occupational exposure to CO. This chemical
is very volatile and will quickly evaporate and therefore, will not be present
in the cured contact cement.
