Media Folks,

Parliament presented brand plans to Mike and Bob on Friday. Mike requested a plan and $ needed if we were to consider
expanding Parliameni's media support to all of Region 1 (- Bangor). Since we are already in print in all of R1, this is an
OOH exercise. Could you please have the Agency work up a recommendation for 1996 and include appropriate levels
needed for first-timie OOH in these markets. | will need the plan by November 13th.

in the end, we can prioritize markets contingent upon any incrernental $ received. I'd like to submit a plan for all R1-
Bangor going in. ['rn here if you have any questions.

Lauren- In the meantime, while the media folks are looking at all markets (-Bangor) in REgion 1 equally, please pull
Parliament's share in each R1 market and look at marrying with RDM by market in order to prioritize markets (if nesded)
based on any incremenial dollars received. We may want to go dawn to the county level?? Thanks.
