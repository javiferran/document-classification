The Tyrode solution, which contained in addition to the normal
constituents, i ml of 0.1% acetyl choline and enough albumin to make
a 2 per cent solution, was saturated with a gascous mixture of 95:5 of
oxygen and carbon dioxide, was delivered through a needle located at

the top of the exposure chamber to the lower end of the trachea at a

rate of 0. 00206 ec/min by means of a “Harvard infusion pump. This

The air line to the smoking chamber had a constant flow rate of

ayy

1.2 2 U/mnin.. This rate of flow delivered in 2 seconds, a constant volume
of 40 ml of cigarette smoke per puff. “Es, o
” The other air line lead to the exposure chamber. This air was

passed through two. additional acidified potassium permanganate scrubbers

and an additional gas wash bottle filled with distilled water to adequately
humidify the air, The gas wash bottles were immersed in a constant

| temperature water bath. The scrubbers can be seen in Figures 16 and 17.
