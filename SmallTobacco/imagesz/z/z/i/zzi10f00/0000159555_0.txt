SUBJECT: COMPARISON OF B&W, FIC AND TITL DATA FROM THE
24TH MARKET SAMPLE

 

We have received the FTC data for the 24th Market Sample (purchased
October — November 1979). A comparison was made between B&W, FIC and
TITL smoke delivery data on B&W brands, The B&W data were from the
smoking of a duplicate sample population sent to us by TETL. The FIC
results are the first generated by the FIC on their new carbon monoxide
smoke machine. The TITL data is from their retest of the 24th Market
Sample using the FTC type carbon monoxide smoke machine. Table I
summarizes the smoke delivery data of all three (3) laboratories for
B&W brands. B&W average tar delivery data shows good agreement as
compared to FTC and TITL data.
