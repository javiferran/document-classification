Rob,

Or. Gallagher {s very receptive and has ideas for stories. We need to identify a few good dates to
meet with him so you can fill him in on details of what we have to offer. | said we'd go to his office

seeing he came here this time. if it's difficult to make the time, we can ask him to come here again.
