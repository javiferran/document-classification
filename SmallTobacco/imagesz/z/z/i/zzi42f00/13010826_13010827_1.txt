lronically, lower cosi health care professionals and those specializing in preventanve health care are excluded
from most health insurance systems. An initiatve(#61) in Oregon could change all that The measure requires
patients to be able to access their chosen category of health care provider as long as they are licensed bv the stai:
and the practicitioner is working within their legal scopc of practice

We know managed care organizations, insurance compantes and the medical associations are poing to spend

millions of dollars to keep Oregonians from voung on thus issue. Your industry also has a personal vested interest
in tis initiative.

Your contribution will allow consumers to fight to have a right to rugke their own decisions.

A recent survey showed 73% in support, if voted on today. A generous coruribution to this effort will help 11 get
on the ballot. lts passage could replace lugh cost health care with lower cost health care. For example, replacing
back surgery with a back adjustment or with physical therapy.

As with all initiatives, it takes resources to place it on the ballot. Your contribution will be used for priming,
marketing, and distribution of the HCFI. We need to collect over 100,000 signatures by Juty S, 1996, to qualify for
the November ballot.

With your help we will put Freedom of Choice in Health Care on the statewide November ballot

This 1s also the opportunity for the much maligned tobacco industry to be on the side of good health and its care.

If | can be of any assistance, please call me at (503) 375-3615 or fax (503-375-6350).

We hope we can count on your generous contnbuon and support today. Thank you.
