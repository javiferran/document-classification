HEALTH CARE FREEDOMS INITIATIVE

Apni 9, 1996

Dear Mr. Nelson,

Certain industries in the United States, such as the tobacco industry, have been obligated to pay a
disproportionate share of publicly funded health care costs.

With ap aging population and an increase in employer mandated health msurance requirements al
the state level. costs to the tobacco industry are destined to increase. Only drastic changes in the
health care delivery system can prevent this spirating cosi.

Market research indicates 90% of Oregonians want alternative medicine included in their health

plan. That is why the 1995 Oregon Legislature passed an alternative medicine bill, which was
limited in scope.

The New England Jounal of Medicine published a national study done by Harvard University, in
1993, which determined that over one-third of Americans use some form of non-traditional health

care and pay for it out of their own pocket. This will not change if managed care and insurance
comparucs have their way.

Meanwhile, profit and not for-profit forces have overtly pressured physicians into the anemviable
funcuon of commercial agent to increase the profitability of health care organizations. This
subjective distortion of the physician’s obligation has put at risk the historical trust that is the
central element of the physician-patient relationship. Health care professionals are increasing!y
faced with the dilemma of choosing between patient welfare and the profit of the health care
dclivery system. We believe this is neither good health care nar beneficial to you and aur society.

That's why Orcgonians have launched the Health Care Freedoms Lmtiative (HCFI }, which will:
° help assure ciuizens* choice of category of health care provides,
6 put the patient back into the consumer's role:

° lower the overall cost of health care,

e clear away many of the obstacles between pauient and provider and once again allow the free
market to work
