Dear Kathy:

Attached is a list of authors and advisors that will be attending the June 13
meeting in Dallas. 1 do not know as yet whether or not Dr. Koop will attend. If
Annetta Weber, from Zurich is able to attend we may have to make some last
minute arrangements for her travel. I will let you know,

You should begin contacing people to find out whether or not they will be staying
friday night also. The meeting will probably run until at least 5:00 p.m. and some
people may have problems getting home. Do block enough rooms for all of us, but
as in the past Dr. Burns, Don, Dr. Gritz, Dr. Holbrook and I will make our own
travel arrangements,

If you have any questions please cal! me.

Sincerely, f

William R. Lynn
Acting Director
Technical Information Center, OSH
