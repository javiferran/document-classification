An area of concern is the acceptance of packs without the Miles, when
submitting Miles for Marlboro Gear redemption. In talking with several
smokers, it was mentioned that they had received credit for their Miles even-
though their Marlboro packs did not have any. Up to now, the Marlboro Miles
program have helped us to combat Export sales.

If there are any questions in reference to this, please call.

Regards,
Herb
