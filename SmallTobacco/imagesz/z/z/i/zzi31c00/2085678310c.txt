Hi-

Just want to see if there's anything else on this as | would like to send out the transmittal letters.

Also, can you please call me regarding your comments on the SGMA proposal. | didn't understand them
and have not heard back from you. We only need about 5 minutes on that one-

Eric Ostern,

Manager, Youth Smoking Prevention Programs

ps-—-note that the ist Tee is not moving forward wi the research at this time as they do not have the
funding they need.
