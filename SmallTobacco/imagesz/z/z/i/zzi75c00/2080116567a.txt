Subject: prevention in Richmond Public Schools

Good morning, Mr. Fernandez,

Tom Donahue asked me to contact you about prevention programming in the
Richmond Public Schools. | have been working with the Richmond schools for
six years in the development and evaluation of effective violence

prevention programs. In addition to contacting the superintendent for
parent-employee-community and business engagement (Dr. Jewel Jackson, |
believe), you might want to contact the Richmond Behavioral Health

Authority (RBHA). This agency provides prevention services to the public
schools--they currently do Botvin's Life Skills program in a number of
elementary schools. The director of prevention is Freda McNeal; her number
is 819-4030. This arrangement works very well, as RBHA provides services,
but is not under the authority of the superintendent. Therefore they are

not subject to the frequent changes which occur in that office.

| hope this is helpful for you. Please contact me if you need additional
information.

Sincerely,

Aleta Meyer
