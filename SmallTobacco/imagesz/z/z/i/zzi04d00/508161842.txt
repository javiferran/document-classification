Re: DORAL II Size Reduction

The size reduction program as I understand it has already been approved
by Dr. Laurene, with Marketing concurrence, earlier this year, and

Dr. J. D. Woods provided suggested specifications on that basis. I

see it appropriate for QA to issue new specifications to Manufacturing.
By this note, I ask that anyone who sees these actions, reducing

DORAL II to 24.8 mm., as unauthorized, to notify me immediately.
