social bias as the influence on the interpretation of results of
the prior beliefs and values, the material interests, the career
concerns, and the political purposes of those who conduct what
they claim is objective inquiry.

The study published recently in The New England Journal of
Medicine offers us a clear example of social bias. Previous
investigations had used nonsmoking spouses of smokers as an index
of exposure to ETS, and so this phenomenon should have been of
major concern to the investigators. In addition, given all the
concern about ETS in the society, a reasonably detached observer
should consider the results about ETS in the workplace of
considerable importance. Little had been done studying the effect
of a child's living with smokers, and so these results should have
been of interest. The effect of being exposed to cigarette smoke
in social situations had not previously been the focus of study
and, a priori, should have been a subject of considerable
interest. Science values most highly counterintuitive findings
and any such finding should be emphasized in an article describing
an empirical study.

The study employed a case-control design and examined 191
matched pairs of individuals who reported that they never smoked,
comparing the incidence of lung cancer in people who lived with a
smoker with those who did not. The investigators also reported
the relationship between exposure to ETS at work, and in social
situations, and the incidence of lung cancer. They found the

following results. There was a counterintuitive, statistically
