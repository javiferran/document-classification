Members of this society (the Society for Risk Analysis),
those who do risk analyses, have a very trying time of it. It is
as if they try to fit a square peg into a round hole: If the peg
is small enough it goes into the hole, but we then see that
something is wrong. We think this analogy describes some of the
difficulties risk analysts have when they try to use the
scientific method to resolve sociotechnical conflicts. our
comments deal with health risks because the points we want to make
are illustrated vividly by the sociotechnical conflicts over
health matters.

Few people who are not part of the medical-scientific complex
will deny that something is terribly rotten in the state of health
riske!. The recent condemnations of margarine and milk confuse the
public and reveal to the sophisticated observer that those who
offered the condemnations violated both the norms of responsible
science and the canons of good sense. Margarine has long been
recommended by the cholesterol gang as a substitute for butter to
reduce the risks of heart disease. In earlier years milk was
touted as "the perfect food." The well publicized recent
condemnations of these two substances were based on fragmentary
and insufficient evidence. Some in the public are confused and

many have come to disregard such condemnations.
