list of such "creative" practices. But the members of the
movement who practice creative epidemiology do not openly advocate
the fraudulent manipulation of the data --- that is too much even
for them. Creative epidemiology is something different. It is,

and we quote directly,

Michael Daube, who coined the term, defines
creative epidemiology as, "the ability of the good
epidemiologist to rework data so that what is
essentially the same information can be presented
in a new and interesting form. Thus creative
epidemiology marries the science of the researcher
with the art and creativity of the media

advocate"Â®,

Your ears are not deceiving you, we are not doing creative
quotation. Some of the most prominent members of the antismoking
movement openly advocate, nay urge all and sundry, to violate two
of the norms of science: mixing advocacy and objective inquiry,
and publishing the same results repeatedly for political purposes.
Forgive us if we remind you of two norms of science -- thou shalt
separate objective inquiry from advocacy, and thou shalt not
publish the same data repeatedly.

If this were the only violation of the norms of science that
we found when examining the literature reporting results that
implicate environmental tobacco smoke, we would not be as
disturbed as we are. But, the New England Journal of Medicine,

that holy writ, contains an egregious example of the social bias
