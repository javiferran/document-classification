ABSTRACT

A recent editorial in an influential journal on "The Great
Overcoat Scare," while satirical, presented a serious condemnation
of false accusations of menace against substances of everyday
lifel. Here we discuss and reveal the social bias and the
violations of the norms of science present in the literature
linking environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) to lung cancer. We
stress the importance of including social inquiry in risk analyses

and question the adequacy of "scientific" risk analysis.

It will help us get rid of cigarettes and become a

smoke-free society.
