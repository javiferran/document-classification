the social scene are bound to ask questions about the social
systems that appear to be behaving so foolishly. What are the
social mechanisms that produce such arbitrary condemations? Are
there elite social movements which produce these condemnations?

The work of Ames and his collaborators, by and large, assumed
that the condemnations of substances were not false. Uncertainty
might be present in these matters, but uncertainty is a normal
element of science. aAmes's work assumed the basic validity of his
scale of carcinogenicity for animals. But not all the
condemnations of substances are valid. The substance condemer is
often caught with egg on his face. Coffee is repeatedly condemned
and exonerated; margarine is our savior one day, and a killer the
next; milk is the perfect food Monday, and a danger to babies on
Tuesday; dioxin was condemned for years, and then abruptly freed
of stigma; acid rain, we are told, is destroying our forests, and
then we hear that after spending half a billion dollars we don't
know why the trees in New Hampshire are dying. One day we are
told that alcohol might, just might, produce mentally defective
babies; soon after we learn that red wine is good for the heart.
The pregnant woman with a questionable heart has a tough choice to
make. The ludicrousness of the situation has not escaped the
public. While many consume bran, red wine and walnuts, others
reject risk assessments as nonsense. Dr. Noitall does not
persuade everyone.

We are indebted to Alvan Feinstein for giving us an
explanation of how some false accusations of menace are made.
