wanted to find an association between exposure to ETS and lung
cancer, and that they were troubled when they did not find it.
Others, without a vested interest in condemning ETS, would be
happy if they discovered that environmental tobacco smoke was not
associated with lung cancer. Many of those investigating the
association between ETS and lung cancer exhibit the social bias I
describe here. After all, they are part of a social movement
dedicated to making the United States smoke-free by the year
2,000. We describe the wrongdoings of the antismoking movement in
our monograph.

What lessons can we learn from our analyses of the documents
offered to us by the antismoking movement? Of course we must do
risk analyses. The sad state of the environment in the former
communist countries shows us what happens when there are no public
sociotechnical conflicts. But we must also realize that the
conduct of risk analysis is pervaded by value, ideology, and
political purpose. Any risk analysis that considers itself "just
science' is no risk analysis at all. Science often serves
political purposes and risk analysts should not avoid these
embarrassing, but fascinating, questions --- questions that are

embarassing only to naive positivists.
