SUBJECT: Elan Test Market Timing Confidential

Due to the decision last week to utilize reduced smoke
product on Elan, Brand is recommending a one month delay in the
Elan test market from June 27 to July 25. Doing so will resolve

several issues.
° Final decision of tar and nicotine levels for reduced
smoke,

° Completion of initial testing with reduce smoke product.
° Availability of teartape calling out reduced smoke.

° Sufficient lead time to incorporate reduced smoke in ali
materials and ads. :

The following outlines timing parameters for all materials.

Management Materials - Brochure and folder have been already
turned over for production without reduced smoke call out,
however, this can be handled with a single page insert in the

folder or on the Sell Sheets which are printed in Black &
White. Trade pieces do not carry T & N's so this is not an

issue.

Richmond Materials - Both the sample 20's and 2 for 1
sleeves are in production in Richmond. Mark Walchak confirmed a

last possible day for assembly of June 15 for an August test’
Market.

Advertising - Final decisions must be made by June 10 to
meet closing and proofing dates. Once an ad is released it

cannot be changed.

Outdoor - Decision has been made to run approved outdoor.
Only T & N must be changed. Final decision for August test is

first week of June.

Point-of-Sale - As insurance we will produce two separate
sets of point-of-sale materials for the first month. These

materials need to be put into production by mid-May.
Teartape - Landor is working on a "reduced smoke" tape for
review ASAP.

In consideration of the above information, the reduced smoke
product changes can be included in ROP and magazine ads, in
