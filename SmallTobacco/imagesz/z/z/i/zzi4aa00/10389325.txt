Dear Harry?

The attached release is quite significant ond I
hope you'll be able to use it. This is the first time
anyone has bad the courage to criticize the report of
the nursing comission study,

Of course, the criticiam comes from one side of
the fence that scoms to be getting a raw deal. There
are, as you know, a lot of LYNs in California and the >
report does affect them in the long rune

Mrs. Martin is quite a gal —— attractive, bright,
wellespoken, personable, And very dedicated. She*s an
RN, the wife of a physician and the mother of four.

If it’s at all possible, I hope you will see the
dimsportance of this story and try te sit down with her
while she’s in Los Angeles. She*ll be checking into
the International Hotel the night of Oct, 22 and wild

be there all the next two days.

At any rate, I bope you and the family are vell.
My best to you and the lovely wifes

With kindest regards.
Sincerely,

Leonard So Zahn
