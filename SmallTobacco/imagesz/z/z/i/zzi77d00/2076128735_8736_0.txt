Purpose

The purpose of this test was to determine whether there were subjective
differences with extended smoking of two ultraslim cigarettes: PM Trim 1
blend control, and the PM Trim 4 model with calcium carbonate, -42 perforated
Paper, and CMC.

Methods

Sixty flavor-low smokers fxom the OC Walk-in Panel participated in this test.
Each panelist was given one pack of the test cigarette and one pack of the
control, and asked te smoke all cigarettes provided. They were then asked to
evaluate the first and last cigarette from each pack on the attributes of
mouth and throat impact, aftertaste, unusual flavor, mouthcoating, tobacco
taste, and acceptability. Presentation order was balanced and analysis of
variance was used to analyze the data.
