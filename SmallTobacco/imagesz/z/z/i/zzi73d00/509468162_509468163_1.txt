4. Although planned staging/blending at stemmeries will be
based on projected buying programs, grade distributions
will vary within groups over the course of the buying
season. This variation from the plan, unless taken
into account, will result in "wavy" group
quality/nicotine distribution.

5. Strip yields within a group could vary if "thin" leaves
are processed at one time and more "bodied" leaves are
processed at another time.

6. There is real potential for even greater nicotine
variation in groups than we are experiencing in grades
coming out of RJR stemmeries unless a plan is in place
-and adhered to for nicotine control.

7. If group nicotines are out of statistical process
control, then reaching blend nicotine targets may not
be possible with a few, inconsistent grade/belt/crop
units to choose fron.

8. Assuming that stemmery grades will be core or "average"
quality grades for the groups, then large lots of
"better" or "lesser" quality grades from dealers,
stabilization and pool will raise issues about our
ability to make "consistent quality” blends. A plan
will have to be put in place to deal with this issue.

9. The opportunity to "cherry pick"' tobacco for whatever
reason (nicotine, quality, etc.) will be diminished.

Group blending could simplify and improve our stemmery,
storage, retrieval and blending operations. Planning and
proper execution of plans are key to success. Contingency
planning will also be crucial. On the whole, the positive
aspects of group blending appear to outweigh the negative
aspects.

If Leaf Department/Leaf Processing and Storage is willing to
commit the required resources to group blending, then Leaf
Program could commit to at least a trial run in the 1989
stemming season with flue-cured C-grades and group 3 burley.
Leaf Program would write and and circulate an AR for the
trial.
