Pros and Cons of Group Blending at RJR Stemmeries as
Assessed by Leaf Program

T. Je Porter, vr. = 2/16/89

Market and grade mixing in staging areas prior to
stemming will yield a consistent group prior to
processing.

with multiple in-feeding of farm bales/prize room tersa
bales, there will be good grade/market/bale mixing.

Group vs. grade runs will result in longer stemming

runs with fewer changeovers. strip particle size should
improve and moisture and stem content should be in
better control.

With fewer grade/belt/crop/nicotine units available for
blending, stemmery groups will have to be run in
statistical process control for nicotine.

Blending bulkers will be used for blending, not simply
for conveying tobacco.

Fewer grade/belt/crop/nicotine units will result in
better utilization of storage space and simplified
retrieval for blending.

Storage remnants will be reduced.

Group blending at the stemmeries lends itself to whole
container blending at primaries.

Blend modeling will be simplified with fewer
grade/belt/crop/nicotine units available for use.

Increased manpower and larger staging areas will be
required. More time and effort will have to be devoted
to planning/executing required staging.

Multiple in-feeding units will have to be purchased and
installed.

Group market/grade/bale staging may be by-passed if
staging is deemed inefficient/inconvenient by stemmery
personnel.
