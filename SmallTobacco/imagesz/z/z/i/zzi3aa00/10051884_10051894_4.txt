Some indication of the potential of atmospheric pollution may be
derived from observing the change in lung cancer mortality before and
after heavy industry moves irto a residential area. In the Spring Branch
area, for example, the rate has more than doubled in 10 years. Since
the rates among women are so much lower than among men it is possible
that a combination of the effects of occupational exposure and atmospheric
pollution may account for the high rates among rnales.

In any sound study one must be constantly aware of the movement
of populations as well as of industries. Studies similar to this and demo-
graphic studies invariably provide clues relative to other areas and popu-
lation subgroups requiring further investigation.

It ls apparent that there is a large area of scientific unknowns rela-
tive to the long term health effects from the complex micro-chemical
environment. Thousands of chemicals and chemical combinations exist,

the effects of which constitute scientific unknowns. There is no simplistic

answer to the cause of cancer.

Cancer of the liver in Houston is being studied by region, occupation,
and types of exposure to explore the possibility of vinyl chloride as an
etiologic factor. These studies point out the need for the ecientific communi-

ty to redirect its attention and research efforts to the exploration of the

â€™ earcinogenic potential of the micro-chemical environment ~ a virtually

unexplored area.
