regions have low lung cancer rates, fall in the older age group and have

a high median income. The contiguous region south of River Oaks between
Main, Old Main and Chocolate Bayou also has a low mortality rate for lung
cancer, has the sarre older population, a large proportion of long-time
residents, but a very low median income.

The rates are highest for the center city and the Heights and for the
Spring Branch region. The rates in the last region have doubled in 15
yesrs since the entry of heavy industry into the area. The ages of the
inhabitants are in the younger category.

The industrial area between Griggs Road, Walker and Chocolate
Bayou, has a very high rate of lung cancer. West of Mykawa. the age is
young and there is much heavy industry. The rates for lung cancer are
high. |

The region on the other side Ã©f Mykawa, mostly residential, with
many long-time established areas has a middle range income and a low
lung cancer rate. The regions with low rates are out of the path of the
usual prevalling winds carrying pollution and have little or no industry
within their borders. Presence or absence of atmospheric pollution
seeme to be the major difference between regions of high and regions of
low lung cancer mortality. The aunval wind rovettes of the Houston
Health Department show that for most of the year the winds carry indus-

trial pollution over the center city and then in a westerly direction.
