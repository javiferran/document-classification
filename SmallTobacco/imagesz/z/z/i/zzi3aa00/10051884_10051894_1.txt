In Houston, Texas in 1967, a collaborative study was begun between

 

the Department of Statistics of the Houston Health Department and the
Department of Epidemiology of the University of Texas System Cancer
Center, M. D. Anderson Hospital at Houston. In the several years follow-
ing, each of the 235, 000 deaths from every cause for 30 years from January
1940 to January 1970 were coded to the rubrics from the U. S. Bureau of
the Census in effect in 1967. The introduction of new rubrics every few
years in the International Classification of Diseases and Causes of Death
makes studies over a period of years difficult and often imprecise. A
uniform nomenclature applied to thirty years of consecutive records nets
homogeneity of classification and thus accuracy.

The address on each certificate was census tracted to the 1967 census
tracts in Houston. The original rubric coded was carrie? ine separate
place on the card as was the secondary cause of death when it was given.
Because of local concern in the increasing pollution observed as the
population tripled and industry expanded, asthma, bronchitis and emphy-
sema were coded separately when they were mentioned. -

. Concurrently with the mortality study, the incidence of cancer in
Harris County and 71 other counties was being ascertained in a separate
study. Cancer records from all the general hospitals, laboratories and

clinics in Harris County (Houstor) were indexed and abstracted for the
