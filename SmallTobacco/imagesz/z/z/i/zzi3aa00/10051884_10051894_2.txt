resulted in many corrections through the cooperative efforts of the

Health Department and the physicians. The death records were then

coded for Mexican-American surnames, edited, checked and taped in

the Department of Epidemiology at the M. D. Anderson Hospital.

The census tracts, their populations, the cancer records and the

general mortality records were then assembled in regions around the 17

air pollution sample collection stations. Age specific and adjusted rates

were computed for each cause of death for each region in the city, by

sex and ethnic group. Table I gives the rates for heart, cancer. streke

and cancer of the lung and cancer of the total respiratory tract for each

regica for the five year period 1965-1969.

The rates in certain regions are high whether the median ages of the

residents are relatively young or old. The River Oaks and Memorial
