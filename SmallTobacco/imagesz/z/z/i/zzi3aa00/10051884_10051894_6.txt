The request to the Council for assistance in data processing arose
when the regional medical programs in the U. S. were unexpectedly cut-
off leaving the Department of Epidemiology with 350,000 accessions to
be processed and without adequate personnel to process them. The funds

requested and received were used to complete coding of these abstracts,

0 combine all the charts of the individuals represented more than once

who had more than one cancer or who had been to more than one institution
for diagnosis or trvatment .

The editing netted coded material for 250, 000 individuals for 72
counties or 7 regions made up of the combined counties around the medical
center. Programs were written for figuring the age specific and age ad-
jueted rates by site of cancer by sex and by ethnic group for each of the
yegions. The first adequate skin cancer figures complete for a population
were obtained from this material and have been used by the Climatic Impact
Committee of the National Research Council in studying the effects of the
Supersonic Transport in checking the climate. A report on multiple pri-
mary cancer has also been published from thie material. A librarian has
assembled and kept current coverage of the cancer and epidemiological
literature since 1946, This is divided up by its relationship to specific
anatomic sites. The additional support is sought to elicit environmental
factore ae they appiy to cancer by site in different regions in Texas and to

publish a book on the subject.
