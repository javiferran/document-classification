Mr. J. C. Holley, Jr. Page Two
September 7, 1978

Our inability to buy the full complement of spreads (due to a
later start of’ "High Country" than planned) should release
more than-sufficient funds to cover the overage caused by
production. I will get an exact fix when "High Country" is
finally committed, and changes at that time will require a
budget adjustment by Betty.

Please also take into account 1977 Memo Billing detailed in
Exhibit 7. According to our best estimate - with 90% of the
billing complete - there will be a net underspending of
$188.6M, considerably more than the earlier estimate of $79.5M.
Should there eventually be a significant underspending when

the program settles, there are a number of suggested possi-
bilities to consider to utilize the funds:

1) Produce further pool-outs of "High Country" in 1978

2) Buy additional spreads, ‘probably January, (December
newsstand) monthlies

3) Buy additional pages, timing, and medium as #2

4) Buy additional Bulletins as per "Increased Introductory
Spending Proposal" submitted earlier

All are subject to feasibility according to decision timing on

"High Country”.

Sincerely

Keith Corlett
