Re: SALEM FULL FLAVOR Budget
Dear John:

I am enclosing the latest budget information for SALEM FULL
FLAVOR. Recap is as of September 5 and is based on:

a. August 25 revised budget information supplied by
Ms. B. R. Garner

b. Esty Media August 11 report issued to you earlier

ec. Production spending in the light of management changes
to High Country, currently in progress

After inclusion of the mandatory $275M corporate reserve mini-
Mum contingency, and $951M for spreads, the Brand has a nega-
tive net variance of $38M:

 

Net Budget Net Actual Diff.

FULL FLAVOR $12,515 $12,553 (38)
16 MG. 1,734 1,734 --
Total: $14,249M $14,287M (38)

The overage-of $38M in total budget stems from a production
overage of $119M, only partially offset by an underage of
$81M in space (See Exhibit 2).

The production overage mainly results from:

hel6 LZ00S

a. Increased shoot and preparation costs previously dis-
cussed and reestimated, and additional work associated
with High Country currently in progress. =

b. Inclusion of Black and Ethnic print not included in the
last report.
