RE: Factors Affecting SALEM’s Performance

Listed below are key long-term and short-term factors that
have impeded SALEM’s ability to achieve Nielsen share
objectives and volume for 1988 and, moreover, will also
affect any projections pertaining to 1989.

I. Long Term
1) Continued growth of Savings Seqment

- SALEM particularly vulnerable due to franchise
profile

- Represents a source of high switching losses for
SALEM

2) Continued decline of 18 - 34 year 01d target
smokers among both General Market and Black Market

smokers

~ Losses of "quits" are not being offset by gains
from "new" which places longer-term downward
pressure on SALEM’s share trend

II. Short Te

1) Increased competitive price/promotion pressure

- Higher Savings Segment pressure including
probable expansion of Alpine in 1988 and 1989

- Proliferation of menthol line extensions
- New strategy by B&W to place market support

behind volume for Kool, typically. a major
contributor to SALEM switching gains
