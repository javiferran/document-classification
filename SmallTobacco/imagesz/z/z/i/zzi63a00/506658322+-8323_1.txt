*Estimated volume impact not contained in SALEM’s 1989

Trend.

Although we can not quantify the volume impact on

SALEM, Kool’s heightened level of promotional support
has clearly affected SALEM’s ability to generate both
switching gains and occasional use volume from the
Brand. Consequently, this "negative" factor can be
best described as re 9 u

switching gains.

Please advise if you would like to discuss further.
