owed Ferriabough at least $2,500.
She will draw $6,600 from the city in

paign reports show. She will be paid
$860 a week for a total of $5,160,

frequently drove Bolling during his
campaign, will be paid $550 a week,

Though personnel changes are rou-
tinely included on the council agen-
da, Bolling brought the appoint-
ments to the floor as a late order, so
they were not listed on the published
agenda. Late orders generally are
legislative matters that arise after
the agenda is compiled on Tuesday.

 

 

Smokers burning over ban

-) “It's up to the individual,” said
Teahan, adding that the Corrib will
be a duller place if all the smokers
migrate elsewhere. As for the town
meeting members, he said, “Next
theyll be complaining about girls’
perfume and men’s aftershave.”
v: Antismoking sentiment was also
strongly represented at the Corrib,
and some regulars said they ap-
plauded the town meeting membera
who voted for the ban,

aeighborhood, and being a nonsmok-

er, it's nice to come into a place.

where you can have a meal or some-
thing without smoke.”

Smoking is less popular at the
Corrib than it once was, and man-

. ager Eugene Bligh estimates that

the number of smoking patrons has
‘Aeclined 40 percent in the last two or

Bligh said that smoking cessation
programs were more effective than a

_ smoking ban, which he believes will

simply force smokers down the

_ Street to the pubs of Allston,

*] think the way the Health De-
partment was handling it was the

_ Yight way — to phase it out gradually,

in five or six years, by reducing de-
mand,” Bligh said, “Doing it this way
just doesn’t make sense. It should be
a statewide law.”

Among Bligh’s patrons, there
were no objections te banning smok-
ing in taxicabs. But both heavy and
occasional smokers said they rel-
ished having a local spot where
smoking was as great a part of the
eonviviality as talking politics and
watching televised sports.

“I know people who don’t smoke,
but when they come in here they'll
ask for a cigarette,” said Hyder. He
blamed the new legislation on, “do-

* gooders in the town who just don't

want bars ahd drinking.”

Down Harvard Street from the
Corrib, Mary Franklin was enjoying
an after-lunch smoke in a doorway
before heading back to the insurance
office where she works, “Smokers
are already an endangered’ species,
and now we're becoming a hunted
species,” she said.
