RESTRICTIONS:

When making applications to tobacco seedlings in float systems, prevent contamination to the
float-water by keeping trays tightly packed so no water is exposed to the spray.

Follow different rates as indicated above for outdoor seed beds vs greenhouse or float-bed -
systems, Reduced rates for the latter are necessary to prevent injury which could occur if
the higher rate is used on the more succulent greenhouse or float-bed seedlings.

DO NOT SPRAY AFTER APPEARANCE OF FIRST BUTTON OR WITHIN 21 DAYS OF
HARVEST.
