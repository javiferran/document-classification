RE: Case number 5835

Dear Dr. Chiao:
Your recent inquiry concerning support by this Council for a
proposed research project has now been considered by the

members of the Scientific Advisory Board.

They asked me to notify you that they cannot encourage formal
application for support of this study at the present time.

We trust that you will obtain the support you seek elsewhere.

Sincerely yours,

f
