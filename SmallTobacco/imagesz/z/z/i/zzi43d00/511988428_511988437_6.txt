SMOKER HEALTH ISSUES

Is smoking this cigarette safer than smoking other
cigarettes? .

We will not be making any health claims. This cigarette will
carry the same Surgeon General’s warnings as other’ .
cigarettes. The only claims we will make for this cigarette
relate to the fact that it reduces second~hand smoke by about
90 percent and that it has less “tar” and nicotine than 95
percent of the cigarette brands on the market. -

Is it a safer cigarette? - os

I can’t answer that question because,. to be very honest, I

don’t know. I can assure you that many scientists will be

testing this cigarette, reviewing our test results and
expressing their views on that question.

What about those test results reported in’ the.New York Times?

 

First of all, this cigarette is still under’ development and
is not ready for introduction. ;

We and others will be testing the cigarette using the. same
tests that have been used over the years to evaluate other
cigarettes.s All I can tell you is that our preliminary test
results. indicate that because this cigarette primarily heats,
rather than burns, tobacco, the test results will be
different than other cigarettes on the market.

When development and testing of this cigarette are complete,
the results of our tests, as well-as tests conducted by
others, will be made available to the scientific community
and they will form their own judgments in response to. -your.

- question.

What is your judgment/opinion? Is it or is it not:safer?
Could it be worse? . . . ne

Our analysis to date has shown that there is nothing in the
smoke of this cigarette that is not in the smoke ‘of other
cigarettes. In addition, much of what is in the smoke of |
other cigarettes is Significantly reduced in this .cigarette,
including. “tar” and nicotine. The smoke of: this cigarette is
primarily water and glycerin. ee
