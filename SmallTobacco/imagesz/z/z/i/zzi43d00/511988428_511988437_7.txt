Let me repeat, the only claims that we will be making for
this cigarette relate to the fact that it reduces. second-hand

.Smoke by about 90 percent and that it has less “tar” and

nicotine than 95 percent of cigarette brands on the market.

This looks pretty simple, why was it not developed. or
introduced earlier (i.e., in the 60's, 70's or 80's)? .

It may look simple, but it wasn’t easy getting here and, in

_ fact, development is not yet complete. We and others have

experimented with the concept of heating rather. than burning
tobacco for many years. But it wasn’t until the mid-1980's
that RJR was able to put together a cigarette that actually
worked. It has taken us the years since then to design a.
cigarette that we believe may be acceptable to smokers. This
work continues.

Who else can see/review your research/data?

Once development and testing are complete, we will: share our
test results with the scientific community and anyone else
who is interested for their evaluation. mo

Doesn't it have some of the same smoke compounds as regular
cigarettes? i ie

Yes it does, and that’s because it is a cigarette. The
difference is-that most of the ‘compounds have been greatly
reduced. The smoke of other cigarettes comprises 20 percent
water and glycerin, and 80 percent other components including
tar and nicotine. The new cigarette’s smoke, on the other
hand, is 85 percent water and glycerin and 15 percent other
components. ss ,

Have. you or anybody else tested the health ramifications of .
the cigarette? If so, how and what were the results.

Several independent researchers have expressed an interest in. .

evaluating the product once development is completed... We
will encourage independent testing of this new cigarette.

Has any government agency: tested and approved this cigarette?

No. This cigarette is still under development.
