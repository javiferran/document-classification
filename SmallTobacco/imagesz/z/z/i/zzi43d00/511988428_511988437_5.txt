We don't design cigarettes for nicotine levels, we design
them for overall smoker acceptability. Nicotine is only
one element ~~ that really can't be isolated ~~ in, | a
determining overall taste acceptability of this-or any other
cigarette. ae 7

Did you do anything in designing the cigarette to inorease -
the amount of picotine smokers get? (Did you add: ammonia, ©
sodium carbonate or otherwise attempt to adjust the’ pH?)

I'm not a scientist, but the important thing. for you to
understand is 1) the smoke from this new cigarette has less
nicotine than 97 percent of ‘brands available,.:and 2). the .
only nicotine contained in the new cigarette comes from that
which naturally occurs in the tobacco. ec

Will you provide the product and test data to the FDA prior.
to introduction? re ee

When the product is ready, it will be available to. anyone.
We have no plans to provide anything to the FDA prior to
introduction because in our view, the -FDA does not: have

jurisdiction over cigarettes, has no established standards
for testing cigarettes and does not have the expertise.
