Dear Jane:
Attached please find two copies of the 1988 Agency Compensation Agreement
as outlined in my memo of March 30, 1988. Please return one copy to us
after you have signed it.
We have very much enjoyed working with the Agency over the past twelve
months during which we have had to deal with many difficult issues. This
coming year will be a hallmark for both Y&R and Reynolds with the
successful introduction of SPA.
We look forward to an exciting and challenging year ahead.
B pt regards,
ly Negima’
