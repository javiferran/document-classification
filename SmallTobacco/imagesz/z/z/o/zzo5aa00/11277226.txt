K fomments tha F and D stopped the
rebs Labs from making Laetrile and
Dr. Howard H, Beard BL5 about 2 months ago due to the
Beard Biochemical Laboratory fact that the lab did not make

5220 Locke Avenue application for a new license to

Fort Worth, Texas make these products. This letter
given below from Dr. E.T.Krebs, Jr

Dear Howard: gives the position of this matter

as of September, 7, 1962. HHB,

Many thanks for your letter of 30 August. I have been so busy of
late that I have neglected writing my very best friends, most trusted
associates, and loyal Beardians. Like the prophet, Abdullah, you
head the list.

One filing about sixty days ago was made with the Federal Food and
Drug Administration, This consisted of about nineteen pages and
could be considered a memorandum of information. Notice has been
received that this filing is incomplete. I have prepared another fil-
â€˜ing that will amount to almost 400 pages, and I trust that this filing
will be considered complete. The statutory limit for notification on
a filing is sixty days, as you know; however, in some cases noti-
fication is given earlier than this.

You can advise your physician friends that a new drug application of
almost 400 pages has been made to the Federal Food and Drug Admin~
istration and that a similar filing will be made with the corresponding
California agency within the next few days.

I want to thank you for your intense and continuing efforts in the
cause of Beardlanism. I appreciate very much what you say about
the pressure you are receiving from doctors, since we are feeling
a bit of this ourselves.

As I may have told you, Doctor M.W. McDougall of 529 Bast 10th
Street, Long Beach, California, is working on the Beard Anthrone

- Test. Perhaps you would like to drop him a line to welcome him to
the club,

Cordially yours,
| ~y. KA
