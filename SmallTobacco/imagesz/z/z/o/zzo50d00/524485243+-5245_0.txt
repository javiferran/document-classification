PROMOTED VOLUME
FLOW IN/OUT ISSUES

The issue of flow in/flow out has created a long term
measurement issue with regards to retail promoted volume.

Simplistically, this issue is driven by the inability to more
accurately evaluate Regions’/Divisions' PV based on retail or
wholesale volume. Compounding this issue is: the dynamic
nature of volume as it is affected by the key measurement of
time; and the geographic location of direct accounts versus
that of their customers.

ideally, available volume measurement systems should be

demographically specific, dynamic with regard to variance,

and inclusive of the total universe. Any shortfall in these

characteristics reduces evaluation to a poll versus accurate
and/or predictable data.

Current volume measurements issues are as follows:
e SIS - demographically specific, inclusive of the universe,
but not very dynamic.
_e AIM - demographically specific, relatively dynamic, but not
totally inclusive of the universe.
e MSA - dynamic, but not inclusive, and often not
demographically specific.

Current PV measurements are directly affected by the above
issues, and rendered inconsistent by them on a Region by
Region basis. Further complicating this problem is the
selected methodologies available.
