¢ BAN PV - Easy to access, measurable at Division level,
Time dynamic, but often grossly distorted by flow in/flow
out.

e Marlin PV - Easy to access, not distorted by flow in/flow
out, but monthly limits on time dynamics v8 9nd not
measurable at Division level.— 4-#

¢ AIM PV - Fairly time dynamic, measurable at Division
level, but difficult to access, and limited universe.

Solution:

Create a simple user friendly macro which marries the
strengths of each existing system to create a time dynamic,
demographically specific and universe inclusive flow in/out
conversion retail PV tool. This tool must borrow heavily from
the existing retail measurement tools (sales effectiveness,
aim, msa etc.), use easily accessible data, and apply simple’
formulas, while providing data which is measurable at
Division and Region level for specific retail PV performance.
it must reliably compute and adjust automatically, thus
making it useable by virtually anyone. It should not require
the creation of any new programs by our systems people nor
require a Ph.D. in computer science.
