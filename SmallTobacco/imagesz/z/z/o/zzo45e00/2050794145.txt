Subject: Collecting cigarette butts from ashtrays

L. T. Kozlowski is the individual who has published information on examining spent cigarette filters
for evidence of ventilation hole blocking. Attached are abstracts of five papers he has published on this
subject; please note that the search strategy was not a priori restricted to Kozlowski. The abstracts do
not make explicit statements regarding the source of the butts used in the studies, so it is impossible to
pinpoint one that may have entailed collecting cigarette butts from ashtrays, without reading the actual
papers. If none of the papers is the one you are seeking, the next step probably should be to look at
the cited papers and the subsequent papers citing Kozlowski’s publications.

The attached abstracts are from the psycINFO {DIALOG: File 11}, EMBASE {Excerpta Medica; DIALOG:
File 73}, and SCISEARCH {ISI’s Science Citation Index; DIALOG: File 434} databases. You probably
have copies of the articles already, but if you do not you may call either Sharonda Crenshaw (eat.
4802) or the general Library extension of 2877. If you require a citation search, or if I can be of
further assistance in any other way, please feel free to call me at ext. 5352.
