2. Evaluate important variables affecting heat transfer (flux)
from smouldering cigarette to a substrate of known thermal
properties.

Target: 4th quarter, 1981

III. OBJECTIVE: To develop techniques for mechanistic studies on processed
tobacco; to develop techniques for analysis of blended

tobacco.

PLANS

1. Evaluate free radical technique for determining thermal history of

a tobacco shred from the tower.
: Target: 2nd quarter, 1981

2. Evaluate free radical technique for sensitivity to matrix structural

changes during expansion processes.
Target: 3rd quarter, 1981

3. Evaluate reflectance spectrophotometric technique for analyzing

blends of bright, burley, and oriental.
Target: 1st quarter, 1981

4. Evaluate technique in 3 above for. analyzing all components in a

blend.
Target: 2nd quarter, 1981

5. Determine if DTG can provide blend analysis information.
Target: 3rd quarter, 1981

6. Determine relationship which. may exist between water band in NIR

and water present in tobacco. .
Target: 4th quarter, 1981
