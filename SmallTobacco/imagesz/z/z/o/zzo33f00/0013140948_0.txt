A A PY PUD Stanttation

The VICEROY Brand Group has selected the name 'VICEROY Rich
Lights" for the new 9 mg. â€˜tar! product we will be introducing
nationally in May. In conjunction with the name, we have developed
a pack design which contains the copy

LOW 'TAR! - ENRICHED TOBACCO

on one face panel and

"Tar' 9 mg. nicotine 0.7 mg.
average per one cigarette

on the opposite face panel.

The VICEROY Brand Grown has heen requested to furnish our 1 cal
Department a written statement substantiating the claims:

1) LOW 'TAR' (i.e., the product will be low 'tar' by virtue of
it being single digit)

2) ENRICHED TOBACCO

3) Ability to control the 'tar' and nicotine data
