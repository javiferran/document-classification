Dear Member:

 

The enthusfastic response to our previous edition of the
Washington State Guide to Business and Industry has exceeded our
greatest expectations. The guide has proven ftself virtually
indispensable to Washington Businesses.

Preparatton for the new edition is now beginning. The new
editfon will be an ftnvatuable tool for promoting business among
Assoctation members; both newcomers and tong standing members
alike. Nowhere else wfll you find a complete guide to the goods
and services of members exclusively.

In addition to the directory section and business guide, we
will be commemorating the one hundredth anniversary of our great
state by upgrading and expanding the color section of the guide.
This new sectfon will include profites of Washington's businesses
and their expanded editorial on such topfcs as tourism, finance,
regional development and international relations. Our deluxe
Centennial tssue will be produced on a heavier stock paper and be
handsomely bound in a high quality cover.

The widely respected Windsor Publfcations will be producing
the book, and I have asked their representative to contact you
personally ta show you the new layout and ft's additional
features. To request a specific appotntment, please return the
enclosed reply card promptly.

Sitncerely,

DQ Dah

Donald I. Barber
