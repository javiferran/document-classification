L&M 100’s prototypes will be submitted to the Richmond Panel for subjective evaluation if
C.I.’s are within specifications,

Project" Andes” (Panama)

C.L.’s have been completed on the Project Andes prototype and Control (Kool). Target for
menthol-in-smoke for the prototype was .40 mg/cigt. Actual menthol-in-smoke on the
prototype is .52 mg/cigt. and Kool delivered .38 mg/cigt. menthol-in-smoke. Results have been
forwarded to Panama.

Marlboro Stem Blend Trials (Panama)
C.I. on the following Marlboros from Panama have been completed:

Control - Code 984 - 65% burley stem, 35% flue-cured stems
Test  - Code 985 - 100% flue-cured stems

C.L.’s results are very similar on both samples. Both samples have been submitted to

Betty Handy for nitrate nitrogen analysis. Richmond Leaf Panel will subjectively evaluate the
Test vs, Control.

Asta Trials (Spain)

Survivability trials are scheduled to be run in R&D Semiworks Primary on 1/23/91. The
Control consists of a 50/50 blend of DBC Bright and USA RCB, the Test will be a 50/50 blend
