In light of past research, our analyses of the association between the
factors and cigarette smoking behavior are particularly interesting.
Since some studies have evidenced an association between self-esteem

and smoking while others have not, our finding of no association is not
Surprising and suggests that self-esteem may influence smoking in a
complex and elusive fashion. Our findings of associations between
smoking behavior and Rebelliousness and Obedience replicate past findings.
In light of the fact that Rebelliousness and Obedience are only slightly
associated with each other, it will be interest ing to further examine
their relationship with other variables, including cigarette smoking.

The separation of and lack of association between Positive Beliefs,
Negative Beliefs, and Health Beliefs offer an interesting insight into
the cognitive processes of young adolescent

adolescents on scales that were developed using adults, our present
Study derived its factors empirically, which way limit the degree to
which we can compare our findings to those of others, Nonetheless, this

can state our general theoretical
model, which was presented at the beginning of this P

itudinal panel data. In addition,
we plan to generate Similar specific models for other age groups and for

other behaviors, such as alcohol and drug use. It is our hope that the
empirical foundations of the constructs in these models will lead to

meaningful and useful conclusions about the causes of substance use among
young adolescents.
