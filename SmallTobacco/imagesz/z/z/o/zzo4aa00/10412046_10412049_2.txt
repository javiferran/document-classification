mortality rates om the United States.

of the decline in overall rates is thus attribu:able to the
shifts in age-birth order birth distributions.

Table 1 shows the numbers of new matemity patients
which were served by MIC projects in the United States
ducing the years 1965-1973. Under the assumption that
these patients would have contributed 20 additional diaths
per 1,000 five dirths during the year following their
enrollment in the MIC projects had there been no MIC
projects. the last column shows the deaths that are added lo
the actval deaths in order to estimate the hypothetical
infant mortality rate in the absence of MIC projects. The-e
estimaies are shown in Fogure 2 as the citcis points, and the
broken line as the regression line associated with them. The

triangle points again represent the actual rates for these
years; the solid iine is the regression line from them. The
slope of the solid tine is —0.87 and the slope of the broken
line is 0.78, indicating that about one-tenth of the decline
in infant mortality over these years might (given our
assumption) be attributed to the prenatal and infant care
services of the MIC projects.

Discussion

Whereas shifts in birth order distributions for births
since 1960 that would favor lower infant mortality rates
were thought previously to be cancelled out by shifts in
matemal age distributions that would raise the mortality
rate, our data show that the net effect actually accounts for
about 27 per cent of the decline in infant mortality rates.*
Because we do not know the age-birth order distribution
for the Infant deaths that did not occur to patients of MIC
projects we cannot make statements about an MIC project
effect that is additive with the effects due to shifting
age-birth order distributions. In fact, it is likely that some
of the improving statistics for MIC project deliveries are
related to lower initial risk as a result of more favorable
age-birth order distributions.

However, 73 per cent of the reduction in infant
mortality rate is unaccounted for by age-birth order
changes in Figure 1. This percentage must be due to
age-birth order-specific declines in Infant mortality rate.
Under the most generous assumpticns. only a small fraction
of the decline could possibly be attributed to the success of
MIC projects alone in delivering high quality services to
high risk mothers and infants. Nearly three-fourths of the
total reduction in infant mortality rate since 1965 remains
to be explained.

Conclusions

Twenty-seven per cent of the reduction in the U.S.
infant mortality rate for 1965-1972 is attributable solely
to shifts in age of mother and birth order of infant.
Individual “family planning” has thus made a greater
contribution to the reduction cf infant mortality than has
been previously realized.

mortality rates mn Baltimore 1961~1966." Their findings
for perinatal mortality in this S-vear period of felling birth
rates in Baltimore were similar to ours for U.S. infant
mortality 196f.-1972, namely that"... one-quarter of the
drop” was altributed to age-birth order shifts.
