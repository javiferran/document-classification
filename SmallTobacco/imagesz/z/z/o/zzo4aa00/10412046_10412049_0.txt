Possible causes for a decline in the infant mortality rate
during the late 1960s are proposed and examined
statistically.

 

Introduction

The infan: mortality rate in the United States has
declined since 1960. From 1930 to 1965 the decline was
negligible and was a cause for alarm. Most of the decline has
occurred since 1965. During the period! 1965 to 1970 the
rate dropped from about 25 to about 20 deaths per 1,000
live births» Data through 1972 indicate that it is continuing
to fall al the same rate.

One possihle eyplanation for the fall in infant
mortality tats is related to the falling birth rate observed
during the late 1960s. The dectise in ithe overall infant
mortality rate could have been caused by births Pproporlion-
ately shifting from high mortality risk age and birth order
cells to lower risk cells.” This explanation thus attributes

(Note: not family planning services, necessarily. but
individual decisions and behavior). We will show that the
changing age-birth order distribution of births since 1965
does account for about 27 per cent of the reduction in the
United States infant mortality rate that has occurred.

Another possible explanation concerns the advent of
better maternity and infant care services for high risk
mothers. In 2965 the first Maternity and Infant Care
Projects (MIC), funded by the U.S. Children’s Bureau, were
operating. By 1970 more than 125,000 women per year
(counting new maternity admissions only) were being
served by such projects. The effect would presumably be
the reduction of the risk of infant mortaliiy within high
risk categories to something on the order of risk experi
enced by low risk categories.

Nicholas Wright has speculated concerning the first
explanation,’ Reviewing developments of the 1960s, he has
stated, “With 1960 birth order-specific infant mortwity

over, mothers 30 to 44. Low risk age-birth order cells are
parities 1 and 2, born to mothers 20 to 24; parities 1 to 4,
born to mothers 25 to 29, parities 2 to 4, born to mothers
30 to 34, and parities 2 to 6, born to mothers 35 to 39.'
This risk distribution is supported by data from the
National Natality Survey snd the National Infant Mortality
Survey of 1963-1966, but inasmuch as these data were
confined to legitimate, single births we prefer to use the
more representative da‘a from the 1960 Live Birth Cohort
Study for the cateuiations in this paper.'**
