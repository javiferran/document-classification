From: U. Smith
Subject: Summary for the week of April 10, 1991

I am making modifications to the RTX device software that will cause the
application of power to the heater in a "pulse duration" mode the length of
time negative pressure is being applied to the puff sensor. I am in the
process for modifying, recompiling, testing, and debugging the software.

I am having an energy controller circuit designed and built by Development
engineering. The purpose of this: circuit is to test the affects of varying
the frequency of the energy pulse applliied under pulse width modulation
control, That is, pexhaps there is an optimum frequency that battery life
will be prolonged. May 10, is the: estimatedi completion date.

I am: involved in testing and changing the RTX device software: to produce the
different power profiles needed to test subjective response andi battery

life.
