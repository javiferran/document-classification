SALEM KS Low Tar

A test is scheduled for 11/10/86 through 11/12/86 to collect samples of
cigarettes being produced from several brands of cigarette paper. The purpose
is to determine 1f the cigarette paper porosity is running high on a regular
basis.

Polypropylene Filter Aging Stud

The aging study on DORAL KS Menthol tipped with polypropylene fiber filters
has been completed. No difference in the performance of this experimental
filter was observed by the SED-Menthol Diagnostic panel with respect to time
wunder normal storage conditions (76°F/60%RH). Under hot/wet (98°F/90%RH) and
hot/dry (98°F/20°RH), however, the polypropylene filtered cigarettes
demonstrated more menthol perception when compared to conventional (cellulose
acetate) filtered cigarettes.

Extraction Investigation

Several discussions have taken place with Scientific Affairs Personnel
regarding the safe handling of spray-dried water extracts and eupercriticel
COp extracts of tobacco. Our recommended operating ‘ad safety procedures for
the extraction/spray drying pilot system in 112 Shed, including data on
nicotine contents and particle sizes, are being reviewed. The process
operation has been witnessed and sampled previously by technicians in the
Scientific Affairs Division. Additional discussions on the use and handling
of supercritical extracts are scheduled.
