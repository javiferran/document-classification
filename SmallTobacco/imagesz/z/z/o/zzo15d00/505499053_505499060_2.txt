‘@INSTON KS Low Tar Trend

A study has been initiated to investigate the continued decline in FIC ‘tar’
on WINSTON KS. Tar on WINSTON KS has consistently run under specification for
approximately 18 months (16.2 mg. vs. 16.8 mg. spec.) with no apparent
assignable cause. Tar for the prior 18 months was consistently above ‘
specification (17.1 mg.). Brands R&D has located some WINSTON KS product ”
manufactured during the 3rd Quarter, 1984, when product specifications were

being met. An in-depth analytical review of that product is under way with

the assistance of the Cigarette Design Technology group of Applied R&D. Base

tars will be analyzed by the smoke lab. A similar in-depth analysis was ,
recently conducted on currently manufactured product which will serve as the

control for this study. ~ .

current purging procedure. The first 15 tubs of top dressed cut filler from

each run, following both the new and the current purging of the lines, will be
hand sampled and submitted to the Flavor Division for organoleptic evaluation.
