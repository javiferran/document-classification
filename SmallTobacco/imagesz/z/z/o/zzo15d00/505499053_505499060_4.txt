PRCCESS DEVELOPHENT

G13 Development

Process testing to improve the stripping and conditioning operations at Plant
#63-1 were conducted using liquid water spray in addition to steam in the
stripping drum. Testing will be completed during November. Initial results
indicate that (1) filling capacity loss is proportional to the amount of steam
added to the stripping drum; (2) the measured filling capacity increases sig-
nificantly 10 to 20 hrs. after G13 processing; and (3) significant amounts of
residual freon escape from G13 product 1 to 2 days after G13 processing. A
report will be issued during December.

Modifications to the G13 pilot plant have been completed. Checkout is under
way and testing wili resume for the Proctor & Schwartz treater as an alternate
stripping and conditioning method. —

Piedmont Leaf Slitting Process

mont Leaf on November 3 and is proceeding nicely with more than 20,000 lbs. of

Pack Inspection

On November 6, three R&D staff members visited Videk to witness a pre-
acceptance test of their Model 150 Machine Vision System. The test consisted
of measuring eight cigarette pack features on a package of SALEM LIGHTS 100s.
Measurement of all eight features were made at a 600 pack/minute rate. The
Videk system performed within specifications and is scheduled for delivery in
December 1986.
