mg of diammonium phosphate.

Industrial Hygiene

Employees in the Marketing Development group experienced eye, nose and throat
irritation, nausea and headaches. The source of exposure was identified as a
color copier. The color fixer (1,1,1 trichloroethane) reacted with an
aluminum dispensing apparatus to release hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid
is an irritant without adverse effects when one is removed from exposure.
Removal of the aluminum dispensing equipment will prevent any further release
of hydrochloric acid.

Center of Excellence in Toxicology

The Toxicology Center sponsored a Novel Foods Workshop to address the issues
arising from the increasing intensity of research and development activities
into novel foods and food~related biotechnology products. Twenty-nine RJRN
scientists, representing RJR Nabisco, RJRT, Nabisco Brands, Heublein and Del
Monte, were joined by an international faculty of 14 experts in food safety
and regulations, in Naples, Florida. The world-renowned consultants included
the Deputy Director of FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, a
prominent member of the European Economic Community Committees on Foods,
Veterinary and Animal Nutrition, the Head of the Food Science Division of tke
United Kingdom's Ministry of Agriculture, Foods & Fisheries, and the Director,
Canadian Centre for Toxicology. A full report of the workshop, including
recommendations for RJR Nabisco Management, is being prepared.
