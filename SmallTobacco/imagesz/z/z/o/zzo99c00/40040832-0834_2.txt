1. To identify the Fe binding epitope by deletion analysis and site directed
mutagenesis of our S cDNA clone and expression of modified S using vaccinia virus vector.

2. To prepare synthetic peptides selected from the deduced amino acid sequence of the
FcR CDNA that we have found to be partially homologous to S. To examine if these synthetic
peptides inhibit the Fc binding ability of S. To raise antibodies to these peptides and
determine the ability of these antibodies to bind 5.

3. To examine proteolytic $1 and $2 fragments of $ for Fe binding ability.

4. To determine whether MHV-S protein participates in antibody bipolar bridging via
its Fe binding epitope.This term refers to binding of a single IgG molecule through its Fab
portion to an antigenic epitope and through its Fe portion to an FcR-like epitope (24).

5. To determine whether nonimmune rabbit or rat IgG protect MHV-infected cells from
complement-mediated lysis or from ADCC.

It would have been of interest to identify FcR-like negative mutants and compare their
ability to induce demyelinating disease to that of wt of MHV. However, our results suggested
that such mutants could not be selected using 2.4G2 anti-FcyR mab (see Appendix), suggesting
that the sequences involved in Fe binding are essential for infectivity. This is also
supported by our findings that the Fe binding activity of $ is conserved amongst several
strains of MHV and MHV-JHM mutants that we have examined (see Appendix). Deletion analysis
of our S cDNA clone will permit the identification of the Fe binding site and the modifica-
tion of the molecule so that the Fe binding site is abolished. However, the lack of infecti-
ous MHV plasmids precludes, at the present, the use of such modified S in vivo studies.
As soon as such infectious MHV plasmids become available we will pursue these experiments.

Significance. The molecular mimicry that we observed (4,5) between S viral antigen and
FeyR may have important biological implications. Binding of polyclonal IgG to the FcR site
of S may inhibit by steric hindrance the binding of specific anti-S antibody to S$ antigen.
This will permit virus-infected cells to avoid destruction by immunological mechanisms such
as ADCC or complement-mediated lysis. A different mechanism, achieving the same purpose,
is antibody bipotar bridging, and has been described for Herpes virus (24).

It has been established that MHV-JHM (a neurotropic virus) is an excellent model for
Multiple Sclerosis. The studies we proposed here will investigate a novel molecular mimicry
that we have identified (4,5) between FeyR and MHV S peplomer protein. This molecular
mimicry may result in escaping of the virus-infected cells from destruction by immunological
mechanisms. Identification of the role of this molecular mimicry will significantly improve
our understanding of the disease and may lead to the development of new molecular approaches
for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
