Philip Morris Incorporated Board Meeting

A meeting of the Philip Morris Incorporated Board of Directors will need to be
held by mid-November. The actions that need to be taken are as follows:

(1) Declaration of a dividend to Philip Morris Companies Inc, The amount
of this dividend will be determined next week.

(2) Election of officers, if needed. I have attached a listing of Philip Morris

Incorporated Officers. Could you please have someone review the list
for its correctness. If there are any additions, we can elect them at this

meeting.

I will assist Sharieen with preparation of the Board Meeting materials.
