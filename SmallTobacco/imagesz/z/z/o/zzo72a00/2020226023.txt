I. THERMAL PROPERTIES OF CIGARETTE

Objective: Relate the design of cigarettes to their thermal properties.

Results; The heat loss of freely smoldering cigarettes has been measured with
acalorimeter. Additionally, the heat loss of cigarettes smoldering on
fabric/foam substrates has also been measured. Cigarettes smoldering on
substrates lose weight at about 85% of their rate during free burn. The
cellulose-based fabric used in these experiments.has a heat of smoldering
combustion comparable to the cigarettes themselves. The dimensions of the
cigarette coals were unchanged by placing them on the substrate, contrary to
NISTâ€™s observation. The power output of the freely smoldering cigarettes
appears'to be a linear function of the MBR, while. the heat flux appears to be
independent of MBR.

Further, experiments show that substrates affect cigarette MBRs at separation
distances of up to 4.5 mm, suggesting that the.disruption of the boundary layer
may be an important factor in-extinguishments

We have.also monitored the out flow of gases from cigarettes smoldering in free
air and on fabric/foam substrates.. We see the flow rates cycling about a mean
flow--this behavior may be related to. temperatures cycling in the cigarettes.

Plans: We plan to measure the heat flux of freely smoldering cigarettes and

cigarettes smoldering on fabric/foam substrates as functions of air flow. This
should allow us to determine heat flux as a function of flow rate in order to

explain the role of flow on fabric ignitions.
