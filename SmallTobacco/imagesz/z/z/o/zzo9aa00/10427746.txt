Dear Bob:

Thanks for sending me the note about the “yes's "
end "no's". Along with several from our staff, it
should make a really good conference, Will you send out
the notices to the members of the S. A. B. and then let
me know how many of the staff are coming. Within the
next day or two, I will go to the Benson Hotel, which is
not far from the Institute, and make arrangements for the
number which are coming, namely about 12, I will then
write to each one of the participants, telling them if
they come by train to alight at North Philadelphia Station
and take a taxicab, If, at the airport, to take a taxicab
from there. If on the other hand, I know the arrival time
of one or more, we may be able to meet them with the
station wagon of the Institute or my car, I will tell
them to keep an account of expenses and send them in to
you or give them to you at the meeting,

T am planning a luncheon via caterer at the
Institute and a little dinner in the evening, Most will
come, no doubt, on Friday and stay overnight that evening.
Some will no. doubt go straight home. Others may stay
over until Saturday morning,

I have asked Dr, Tom King of the Institute to sound
the key note opening after Tim Talbot welcomes them, and
so will I and you,

We will have blackboards and projection outfits if
anyone wants to bring slides, etc,

Hope you arrived safe home from Fort Lauderdale,
where we certainly had a good time and got some work done,
re went to Miami for a couple of days and then took the train
ome»

So 1 am just waiting for confirmation of the above
ideas and the number of the staff and the 8. A, B, who are
coming. Bests,

Sincerely your

Stanley P, Reimann, M, D,
