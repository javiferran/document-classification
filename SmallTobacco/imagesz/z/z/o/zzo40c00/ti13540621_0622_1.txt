Advertising Age magazine commissioned a
survey in 1992 that reported, despite high
recognition of cigarette advertising, nine of ten
youngsters thought smoking was “gross.” The
president of the research firm said, “[w]e’d have
to interpret this to say that cigarette advertising
is certainly reaching the eyes of young children,
(but) I don’t know how you could argue... that it
causes them to smoke.”
