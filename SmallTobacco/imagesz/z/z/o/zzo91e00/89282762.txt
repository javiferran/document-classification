Re: — Ingredients Identified by HHS as Used in the

Manufacture of Cigarettes but not Approved

for Use i ,
1. Ammonia -- Ammonia is used as a processing aid in the production of cigarettes.
Greater than 95 percent of the ammonia is recovered for reuse. Only trace levels remain
in the finished cigarette. Due to its low boiling point, residual ammonia does not pyrolyze.
Ammonia is a natural constituent of tobacco. Several ammonia-containing compounds are
listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by EDA for use in food, including ammonia
hydroxide, mono and dibasic ammonium phosphate, ammonium sulfate, ammonium
biocarbonate, ammonium carbonate and ammonium chloride (1 C.F.R. §§ 184.1135,
184.1137, 184.1138, 184.1139, 184.1141, 184.1143). Ammonia compounds are approved
for use in tobacco by the Independent Scientific Committee on Smoking and Health (the
Hunter Committee) in the United Kingdom. . Ammonia is a naturally occurring substance
that is produced endogenously by humans at levels far in excess of that delivered in the
smoke of a cigarette. Environmental regulatory and reporting requirements applicable to
the use, disposal and transportation of significant quantities of ammonia have no bearing on
the appropriateness of its use in cigarette manufacture. The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) workplace exposure limit for ammonia greatly exceeds any levels

to which smokers would be exposed.
