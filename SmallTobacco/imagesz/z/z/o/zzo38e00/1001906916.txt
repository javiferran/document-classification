Celanese roving -- 75 grain cellulose acetate (2 d.p.f. 1-9/16"
staple)

OBJECTIVE:

To compare this roving with the present Parliament mercerized
cotton roving:

a) Machine characteristics

b) Filter efficiency

c) Resistance to draw
RESULTS:

This Celanese material was run on Parliament machines February 10,
1955. Observations and comments are as follows:

1) bobbins are wound too tight.
- 2) sliver diameter was too small.

3) the filaments at the periphery of the sliver are not
well integrated with the main bulk.

4) the sliver falls apart during cutting and positioning.
The poor positioning characteristics may be due in
part to item 2 above. In all the cigarettes, fine
filaments protrude beyond the end of the mouthpiece,

5)* filtration efficiency and resistance to draw are
- approximately 26% and 1.1" of water respectively; as
compared to Parliament regular, 30% and 1.3" of water.

6) the material has sufficient tensile strength for re-
winding and feeding operations.

* The inherent by-pass of Pariiament mouthpiece was
not considered; thus, the resistance to draw results
are only reiative.
