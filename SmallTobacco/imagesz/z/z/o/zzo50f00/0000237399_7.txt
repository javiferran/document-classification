VI. General,

What typeof smoker image is projected by the ad:
that the VICEROY (VICEROY Longs) smoker is
young/cld, active/passive, etc?

Does the ad imply that VICEROY is just for racing
fans or for all smokers? For fun-loving people?

Do the Blends" and "Boring Cigareties'" project
more of a smoker image than the other two
campaigns? Du these two campaigns position
VICEROY smo: 's moore as either (a) racing

fang and/or participants (b) people who generally
lead exciting lives?

 

Please continuc to include questions probing satisfaction and
tobacco taste on all tests.
