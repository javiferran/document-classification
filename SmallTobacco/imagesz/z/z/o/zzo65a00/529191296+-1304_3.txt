When the amount of imported tobacco reaches the threshold quota amount (95% of the quota) for a
country, Customs begins collecting the 350% tariff for all cigarette tobacco imports from that country.
After the entries are processed by Customs, refunds are issued for the overpayment of duty on tobacco

that is deemed to be within quota.

* When amounts reach the ThresholdQuota, customs begins collecting

the 350% tariff. In-quota tobacco refunds are processed later.
