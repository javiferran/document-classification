5. To identify viral gene products expressed in virus transformed and

tumor cells. In addition to using specific viral fragments that have been
cloned and employed in transfection studies (see above), we shall use trans—
formed and tumor cells expressing viral proteins (as judged by immunofluore-
scence) in biochemical experiments to identify viral polypeptides expressed
in these cells. The chief approach will be to radiolabeled (““~I and iodogen
reaction) proteins generated from the membranes and subcellular components

of these cells by salt and/or enzymatic fractionation methods. These radio-
labeled polypeptides will be reacted with various antisera specific for viral
proteins and the antigen-antibody complexes will be precipitated using Staphy-
lococcus protein A, The complexes will be solubilized and the viral poly-
peptides will be identified using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These
experiments may allow us to identify the gene products of individual DNA
sequences and determine whether these proteins are type shared.

III. Duration of Project, Personnel and Anticipated Cost.

Support for a total of three years would be requested. The
personnel involved are listed below. It should be noted that several of
these investigators and support people would contribute to the project

funds.
