Dr. Robert C. Hockett Page 7 December 20, 1979

I shall be happy to provide any additional information that you or
the Council may request. Needless to say, any support received would be
appreciated and the funds would be expended as prudently as possible to
obtain their maximum benefit in our research on viral oncogenesis.

Sincerely,

Dunes Otutlaphe
