I'm writing regarding a proposed Congressional Bill, H.R. 5653, which

would force advertisers to include questionable warning statements relative
to the use of the products by the public despite the fact that such products
are legal, legitimate and claim-substantiated.. This is a violation of

free speech and free choice and could, if enacted, affect liquor, drug,
appliances, automotive, etc., other products and their advertisers.

Attached is a suggested letter for you and your associates to use {on

your personal stationary) and the list of members in the House of Repre-
sentatives on the Health Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee.
Select a few or write tham all. In addition, any cooperation from those
outside your office, clients, friends, etc., can add to the volume of

mail which could have considerable influence in this situation.

Prompt action on your part is imperative and we apologize for the short
notice.

Please see that copies of all letters are forwarded to Bob Berman, DM&M/ New
York.

Gail Smith
