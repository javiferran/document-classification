SUGGESTED LETTER

Dear

RE: H.R. 5653

I am aware that hearings have been held on the above-referenced
bill, that a significant amount of testimony has been received, and
that further attention will obviously be given this legislation.

With this in mind, it is my duty as a businessman and citizen to express
my strong concern over the grave dangers inherent in this bill --- dangers
that rock our Constitution to its core. If a product is legal, legitimate,
and its claims substantiated, it should be allowed the freedom to be
communicated within the guidelines of existing regulatory bodies, to a
public entitled to freedom of choice. To abrogate either of these
freedoms is to violate the spirit of the Constitution of this country.

H.R. 5653, indeed, abrogates both of these freedoms and, as such, should
be defeated.

I greatly appreciate any and all efforts on your part to cut this
bill off in committee.

Respectfully yours,
