PROJECT NUMBER: 6902

PROJECT TITLE: Biochemical Special Investigatiions
PROJECT LEADER:: B. D. Davies
PERIOD COVERED: October, 1989

I. NICOTINE SPECIFIC MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY
ee a th SUNUCLONAL ANTIBODY

A. Objective: To obtain a monoclonal antibody (MCA) against nicotine
(NIC=-MCA):.

B.. Results: A thromboxane B2 scintillation proximity assay (SPA) was
conducted. Results from this experiment: indicted that we can
technically detect antibody-radioisotope binding under the SPA
conditions. This indilcates that previous: negative results with SPA
assays were not. due to technical difficulities associated with
scintillation detection.

Cc. Plans: Confirm with Amersham, producer of the SPA reagents, that
the antimouse SPA. reagents. with react. with our IgM class antibodies.

D. References: Davies, B. Notebook #8638, p 197.

 

II. ADDITIONAL APPROACHES TOWARD PUTRESCINE METHYLTRANSFERASE (PMT)
ISOLATION

   

A. Objective: Provide additional experimental approaches to assist in
the effort to isolate PMT.

B. Results: Worked with B. Dunn on most phases. of this research.
