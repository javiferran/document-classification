*DNA or protein was inoculated three times at biweekly intervals as described in

Materials and Methods.

SAIL mice were challenged with 3 x £05 cells,

with SP2/0-160 cells who exhibited tumors at 8 weeks had died.
However, greater than 85-90% percent of pM160-Z6 vacci-
nated animals challenged with SP2/0-160 cells never developed
tumors. pM160-Z6 cDNA-vaccinated animals followed long
term (greater than 8 months) similarly failed to develop tumors.

DISCUSSION

We have utilized facilitated direct DNA inoculation to in-
duce immune responses against HIV-| proteins. Previously, we
teported that specific antibady responses were developed in
mice immunized with the envelope genes of HIV-l. These anti-

groups of mice were immunized three times at biweekly inter-
vals and challenged 2 weeks later with 3 x L0® SP2/0-160 cells
as noted in Materials and Methods. The mice were followed for
tumor development and mortality. Here, percent survival is
shown versus time following challenge. (MN) Naive mice (12 to-

body responses recognized both gp120 and gp4 envelope gly-
coproteins. Through the use of a aumber of peptides that span
pl20 and gp4l we observed that mice immunized in this man-
ner produce broadly reactive immune reactivities against sev-
eral regions of the envelope proteins of the virus. Eighty and
60% of the mice who seroconverted developed neutralizing an-
tibedies against the homologous isolate and the ability to inhibit
in vitro syncytium formation, respectively. The antibody re-
sponses induced recognized both recombinant Tat and Rev pro-
teins in ELISA analysis. Both of these proteins are encoded. by
the expression vector.S Analysis of cellular Tesponses in mice
demonstrated that 100% of seroconverted animals that serocon-
verted gave rise to splenocytes that would specifically prolifer-
ate in response to recombinant gp120 antigens.} Similarly,
(00% of sonhuman primates (cynomolgus macaques) specifi-
cally seroconverted when inoculated with a similar BPl60 ex-
pression vectar.6

In the present study we have investigated the ability of a
gpl60 expression vector to drive expression intramuscularly.
There has been much discussion as to the location of expression
Of the injected vectors. We observed clear expression of gp160
and gp41 in muscle sections 72 br after injection, These results
do not rule out the possibility that other tissues similarly incor-
porate and express exogenous DNA: however, they serve to il-
lustrate that HIV proteins can be expressed at the inoculation
site.

We have investigated the ability of the pM160-Z6 vector in-
oculation to induce specific CTL responses in immunized mice.
We compared the CTL. responses induced by pM 160-Z6 inecu-
lation with the CTL responses induced in mice inoculated with
recombinant gp 160 protein. We used a vaccinia- 160 expression
system lo prepare targets for this assay. Specific CTL responses
were induced by direct DNA inoculation as we have described.
In contrast to earlier studies in this case the specific espouses
were cross-sirain reactive CTLs in that the pM160-Z6 construct
induced CTL, reactivity that could lyse syngeneic targets ex-
pressing the HXB2 envelope proteins. Such cross-reactive
CTLs could be important in recognizing and ultimately contro!l-
ling diverse strains of HIV-L at the cellular level. In contrast to
