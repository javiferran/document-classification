Antibody titers in these animals were greater than [/2000, fa
contrast ta the genetically inoculated animals, soluble gpl6d-
unmunized animats displayed little if any specific CTL re-
sponses even at the 100/! effector-to-target ratios (data not
shown). Collectively the results demonstrate the consistency of
the gene with bupivicaine inoculation protocol used here to in-
duce significant and specific CTL responses.

Such a model does not recapitulate many aspects of viral infec-

SP2/0 cell tine was available in our laboratory. inoculation of
SP2/0 cells into BALB/c mice generates a lethal lymphoma re-
sulting in heavy tumor burden and eventual death. The goal was
to develop a syngeneic mouse challenge cell Line that could be
of utility in the immunized animals.

SP2/0 celts were originally derived from a hybrid between
BALB/c spleen cells and the PIX63Ag8 myeloma cell. The
SP2/0 cells used in these studies have low MHC class Texpres-
sion but expressed H-24 class [ antigens, as determined by fluo-
rescence-activated ceil sorting (FACS) ‘analysis (data not
shown). To make the HIV-1 envelope expressing murine tumor
lines, the pM160-Z6 envelope expression vector was trans-
fected into the SP2/0 cell line as described.9 Forty-eight hours
after wansfection, the cells were incubated with the and-gpl20
monoclonal antibody [D6, which binds to the amino-terminal
region of gp120, and thea subjected to selection using anti-
mouse IgG-coated magnetic beads. Cell, were cloned and then
analyzed for expression by Western blotting and immunopre-
Cipitation experiments. Positive cells were recloned prior to
their use in these studies. Clones expressing gpl60 were then
tested for their abitity to form tumors by reinoculation of 1-3 x
108 SP2/0-160 cells into naive BALB/c mice.

In this system, mice injected with 3 x 106 cells formed visi-
ble tumors within [421 days that grew to a size of 2.5 cm ina
period of 6 weeks (Fig. 3), Ina typical group of mice mortality
began at week 5, with 100% martality occurring by week 7. The
dose-response curve for increasing wmor cell dase versus sur-
vival was inverse and relatively linear. For cell doses of (0%, 5 x
108 and (07, mortality was noted at 43, 34, and 26 days, re-
spectively, Higher doses of cells (3.5 x 10?) showed earlier
mortatity (21 days), but mortality was no longer linear com-
pared with the lower doses. Histologically, the tumors appeared
as typical murine lymphomas. In summary, the tumors were not

cumbed within 41 days (Fig. 4). Immunization with recombi-
