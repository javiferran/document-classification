TOXICOLOGICAL ISSUES:

As we have discussed, RJR has made unsupported statements
in this area and thus is open to criticism from every
anti-smoking faction. Planning must start now, well
before even test marketing or rolling out the backup
evidence. This can take a number of forms:

A. Articles in scientific journals written by
scientists for scientists. What data will
becoming available and when? New articles such
as this can take up to six months or more to get
into a magazine.

B. General purpose articles and backgrounders for
the non-scientific news media. These will have
to be released in concert with the scientific
articles, to clear up inevitable confusions and
misinterpretations.

Cc. Development of audio visual material for the
electronic media. Development of audio visual
material, brochures, pamphlets, etc. for special
audiences, for example the transportation and
restaurant industries.

In light of this we think it is necessary for RJR to
start work immediately, if they have not already done
so, on an extensive and detailed cataloging of the
tests that have been and will be conducted, the
results, and their implications. If there is to be
actual production within six to nine months, it is
none too soon to start this.

We hope that RJR is analysing the continuing media
coverage which we started in our September 28th memo.
Int his connection someone should explore the
feasibility of putting all of that information in a
computer so that we will have ready reference and
cross reference lists for the next phase of this
campaign.

It might be very helpful for example to see what key
points Morton Mintz of the Washington Post or perhaps
Larry Altman of the New York Times have been making
on the issue.
