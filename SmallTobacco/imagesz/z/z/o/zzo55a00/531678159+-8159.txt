matt myers always finds a way to work in the fda regulation
paragraph in his statements, comments. i'm looking for the
same for us that more often than not would be appropriate
particularly since pm will once again start pushing for
more fda regulation.

i'm not comfortable just blowing out the door on the
perfect debate so looking for how we "take a stand" based
on our beliefs that tells what we do and gives our opinion
on those who call for more taxes, regulation etc.
