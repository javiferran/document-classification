Subject: FW: YSP Literature Database Update

| have created a folder in nydata\process$\Literature Database called "murphyvi". Please give this user (who Is a
PMMC employee) the normal rights to the user folders here.

Also, please give murphyv1 full rights to the top level of the ysp server, mirroring the access rights currently assigned
to Paula Desel (deselp). Afterward, you can remove deselp's access rights completely.

Karen: please click on "Reply All” and approve this access request for Ginny Murphy. Also please confirm that Paula
Desel is no longer to have access to the YSP servers.
