SUBJECT: A Review on the study of Reducing Mutagenicity of Tars
Generated from Various Materiais ~

 

since July 25, we have performed more than 100 experiments. A
summary of the results is attached in Appendix A- We found that
there are two ways to reduce the mutagenicity of tar generated
either from pyrolysis or smoking: BY lowering the pyrolysis/-
_gmoking temperature or by diluting highly mutagenic tar with low
mutagenic tar. Z

The progress of our study can be divided into two stages. The

first stage is a series of preliminary tests which were carried

out in the experiments from run #1 to run #16. We used #1580
tobacco (1) as the testing sample and pyrolyzed it at various
temperatures and flow rates. The Ames test was used to detect

fee the mutagenic activity of tar- phis set of data, as discussed in *
the previous report (2). shows that the mutagenicity of tar
increases with the increase of pyrolysis temperature (Figure 1)-
It also shows that the flow yate has 4 certain degree of effect
on. the matagenicity of tar due to the fact that the compound (s)}

responsible for the activity is(are} low volatile (Figure 2).

 

The next stage is a series of screening tests of some pasic
materials and the mixtures of these materials with other additives.
The results of those basic materials are listed in Table 1. The
relative values used in this table are pased on the value of

#1580 tobacco, which is assigned as 100. The reason to use a
relative value is that, from time to time, the reproducibility of
the experiments is not quite good probably due to the biological
uncertainty as shown in Appendix A, column 9- #1580 is thus used
as an internal reference.

From Table 1, we found that the tar from Whatman #42 filter paper
(w42), 4.e., pure alpha-cellulose, nas wirtually no mutagenic
activity while the tar from Burley stems {BYST) has very high
activity, about 70% higher than that of the #1580 tobacco.

pyst is thoroughly washed, the mutagenicity drops to 14% of

the unwashed one- Burley tobacco has the next highest activity,
about 40% higher than that of #1580 tobacco. The mutagenicity of
tar from flue-cured tobacco is about 30% less than that of #1580.
The reconstituted leaf from Kimberly-Clark (KCRL) has approxi-
mately the same activity as gisso. if the black water is not
