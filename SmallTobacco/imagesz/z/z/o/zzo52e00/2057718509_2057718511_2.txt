PROJECT GRAIN:

A factory trial of Marlboro cigarettes with BTC without alcohol addition and 10%
reduction of alcohol in the aftercut was scheduled in a meeting with MC personnel for the week
of February 24. One line of control and test filler is planned with cigarettes to be evaluated on
internal panels. Additional information from TTG on Australian requirements to remove

alcohol from their casings and flavors indicates modifications of concentrates may also be
required.

MARLBORO STANDARDIZATION:

Marlboro (KS and LS) and Marlboro Medium were picked up on February 5.
Analytical and subjective evaluations will begin this week.

PROJECT LIQUID LICORICE:

Filler for POL 03038 was produced the week of February 10, 1992 and casings and
aftercut were submitted for analyses.
