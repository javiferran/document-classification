From: R. H. Cox
Subject: | Weekly Report for Flavor Technology - 01/07/92 to 02/13/92 - Revised

ART PROGRAM:

Project De-Nic: Prototypes for the evaluation of 1 and 2% levels of calcium hydroxide
on De-Nic are scheduled to be made the week of February 17. Additional models will be made
to evaluate expansion of De-Nic filler by NET and inclusion of the NET at 20 and 35% rates.

Project Half-Nic: Filler for POL’s 05022 and 05024 (with and without calcium
hydroxide) is scheduled to be re-made in Semi-Works the week of February 17. The new ship
dates for these POL’s are the weeks of March 16 and 23.

PACKAGING STATUS:

A meeting was held to discuss "film barrier testing" with Quality Engineering and ARD
personnel. Szu-Sung Yang and Jay Pierotti presented the glassware apparatus designed for this
test and explained the "purge & trap"/GC method used. Further work is needed to determine if
precise quantitative results can be achieved with this test method.

Preliminary analytical testing methods for use in the "Gravure Solvent Migration Study”
have begun using the standard PM headspace method.

Residual solvent levels were determined on sixteen samples.
U.S. Bronze, a bronze and aluminum paste supplier, was on site to develop strategies
for producing low odor aluminum paste. Several test materials will be supplied for analytical

and subjective evaluation. U.S. Bronze supplied the aluminum paste for the B&H KS packs.

An aging study is being conducted for Quality Engineering which is examining a
smaller application pattern of pre-applied adhesive for Project Gold.
