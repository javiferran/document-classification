in vitro lipid peroxidation of red blood cells has been studied
using high glucose (55.5 mM) in the media to stimulate lipid
peroxidation. Vitamins A, C and E in a natural matrix and a
citrus extract reduced lipid peroxidation as measured by
thiobarbituric acid reactivity. A human supplementation study
was done in which it was shown that natural vitamin Cc containing
ascorbic acid and citrus extract significantly elevated lipid
peroxidation in both plasma and urine. Citrus extract alone
decreased plasma lipid peroxidation. Natural vitamin A and E
decreased both plasma and urine lipid peroxidation. A
combination of natural vitamins A, E and citrus extract was the
most effective supplement resulting in more than a 30% decrease
in both plasma and urine lipid peroxidation.

Key words: lipid peroxidation, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C,
citrus extract, thiobarbituric acid
INTRODUCTION

Oxygen, though necessary for life, is a toxic substance.
Fortunately, 98% of the oxygen is completely reduced to water in
the process of respiration. The other 2% turns into potentially
toxic free radical oxidants?. â€˜These substances can damage
proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and polyunsaturated fatty
acids. They can also directly reduce the level of the antioxidant
defense molecules in the plasma, Free radical-mediated lipid
peroxidation has been implicated in several disease states
including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, postischemic

reoxygenation injury, as well as in the degenerative processes
