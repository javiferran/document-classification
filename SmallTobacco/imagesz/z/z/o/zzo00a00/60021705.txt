Dear Ms. Kwan:

Thank you for your interest in our program of research support. In response to
your request, I am pleased to enclose a-copy of the explanatory materials sent by
The Council for Tobacco Research to potential principal investigators who have
inquired about support for their research projects. Those materials detail our two
step application process. The executive committee of our Scientific Advisory
Board first evaluates a Preliminary Application and decides whether or not to
encourage submission of a Full Application.

Their decision is based not only on scientific merit, but also on appropriateness for
inclusion in one of the Councilâ€™s multidisciplinary program areas, as well as
recognition of current support levels for similar projects. This procedure takes
about two months. ,

In order that your office has on hand a reference set of our Full Application
forms, a sample copy is enclosed. You will also find in this package our Statement
of Policy, Information for Applicants and a recent Annual Report that lists
currently supported grants and contains abstracts of papers that have appeared over
the last year acknowledging support from The Council for Tobacco Research.
If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely, ,

Lo j
