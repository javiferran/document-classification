RE: Reconciliation Bill

Senator Metzenbaum may offer, as an amendment to S. 1730

the Senate Reconciliation Bill, two changes to the language

of the Helms-Ford tobacco bill as it is included in §. 1730 --
one relating to the negotiated buy-out, the other relating

to antitrust immunity. Senator Helms, through his staff,

has asked for the companies' reaction to the proposed language
which is enclosed. Please contact Murray Jones, (202)224-2803,
with any reaction that you may have.

S. 1730 is the pending business of the Senate. This amendment, so
and others, could come up at any time. |
