. STATUS REPORT

Phases I and II of the Marlboro Standardization effort
(interviews and investigations) were completed in May, 1985. We
visited each of our locations and held group discussions with
supervision to explain our objectives and to hear their concerns.
These group discussions as well as individual interviews were used to
gather knowledge about Marlboro and to gain an insight into suspected
influences on cigarette subjective response.

Locations Visited

Cigarette Manufacturing Centers-
Louisville (including the ES/ESB Plant)
Cabarrus
Manufacturing Center (including DIET processing)
Stockton Street (including ET processing)

Processing Plants~
Dock Street
DMCP
BL Plant
Park 500
Richmond Stemmery
Flavor Center

We are beginning Phase III of the Marlboro Standardization effort
(implementation). During the week of June 3rd each cigarette
manufacturing center will produce "Standard" Marlboro Long Size and
King Size cigarettes. The exception to normal production is that each
cigarette manufacturing center will use material from the same lots of
"Standard Product" as supplied by our Processing Plants. Prior to June
3, 1985, each of our Processing Plants will produce the required
amounts of "Standard Product" to be used for Marlboro production.

Analytical evaluation of these cigarette will be conducted by
R&D. ;

To support the subjective evaluations, an 0/C Marlboro Panel was
organized in February, 1985. This panel of 48 Marlboro smokers is
evaluating production Marlboro from cigarette pick-ups from each
cigarette manufacturing center to develop procedures and baseline
data.
