Studies of the biophysical profile of nAChR channels expressed by neurons of the medial habenula
nucleus (MHN) were completed and published. (Brussaard et al., 1994, APPENDIX). Briefly the key
findings of this study include the observations that (1) neurons of the medial habenula express multiple
subtypes of nAChRs (2) the distinct nAChR subtypes are differentially expressed during development and
synaptogenesis (3) the subtypes are differentially activated and inactivated by nicotine. (4) the subtypes
differ in their subunit composition. Deletion of the «2, «3 and a4 subunit mRNAs using antisense
oligonucleotides implicates «2 in four distinct nAChR subtypes, 2 of which also include the a4 subunit.
The «3 subunit apparently does not participate in the functional AChRs normally expressed on the
somata of MHN neurons. These findings are reported in part in Pflugers Archiv./ Eur J. Physiol.; the
remaining aspects of these studies were published in Nature (Ramirez et al., 1996) and are in
preparation for publication in Neuron (see below).

Since the MHN expresses increased levels of a5 and «a7 following synaptogenesis, we tested the
possible contribution of these subunits to the mature profile of nAChRs in MHN. The key finding of these
studies is that somatic and terminal (i.e. presynaptic) nAChRs can differ in their sensitivty to nicotine, the
biophysical properties and their subunit composition (see McGehee et al., 1995, Seience, and Progress
on Aim 2, below). The results of the functional deletion of «5 converge with our previous studies of
nicotine-induced activation and inactivation of the 50 and 65 pS channels in MHN, and indicate that a5
probably participates in both of these channel subtypes. The 50 and 65 pS nAChR subtypes have lower
apparent affinity for nicotine, are expressed at later stages of development and are similarly modulated by
PGE2 (below). Treatment of neurons with o5-antisense consistely deleted the 50 pS nAChR subtype as
well as the the 65 pS channel, although the latter is more dificult to assess since it normally cxonstitutes
<10% of all opening events. Furthermore, deletion of «5 left-shifts the nicotine dose-response curve; i.e.
the apparent agonist affinity is increased in the absence of a5. Finally, the profile of subunit gene
regulation reveals parallel increases in the levels of «5 mRNA and increase in NPo for the 50 and 65 pS
conductances, We therefore conclude that «5 is a component subunit of the 50 and 65 pS nAChR
subtypes. (Yu, & Role 1996a, b; to Neuron and see [b], below).

[bj]. Dissection of nAChR subtypes: heterologous expression of known subunit combinations

Studies of MHN nAChRs indicate that «2, a4, «5 (with B4 and/or 82) comprise the functional nAChRs
complexes on the somata of MHN neurons. Our assessment of the nicotinic channel subtypes by
heterologous expression of known subunit combinations has, therefore, focused on both “pairwise” and
“triplex” combinations of these subunits in Xenopus oocytes. In sum, our studies have demonstrated that
functional nAChR channels that include the «5 subunit can be assembled and inserted and, further, that
a5 is a normal component of functional nAChRs in neurons. These data are in sharp contrast with prior
reports that «5 is functionally “dead”. Thus, previous studies of heterologously expressed a did not yield
functional nAChR complexes . Subsequent immunoprecipitation of CNS or PNS nAChRs, however,
unveiled «5 containing nAChR complexes , rendering the role of «5 in functional nAChRs murky, at best.

Our studies began with co-expression of «4 and 62, which yields nAChR channels quite similar to the
25 pS channel subtype we characterized in MHN. Co-expression of either «5 with B2 or a5 alone did not
produce functional nAChR complexes but single channel analyses after triplex co-expression of a4, 62
and «5 revealed inclusion of a5 in the resultant nAChR receptor complexes expressed. Particularly
striking was that the «5-containing nAChRs constituted a clearly distinct nAChR subtype that differed in
