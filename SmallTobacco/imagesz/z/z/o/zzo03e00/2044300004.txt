PARLIAMENT PACKAGING MODIFICATIONS - CONSUMER REACTIONS

I would just like to mention for the record that we
have only received two letters from consumers to date
containing reactions to our Parliament packaging
modifications, and both of these were unfavorable.

Additionally, we have only received one letter which
must have been in reaction to the carton stuffers,

which stated that that consumer preferred the old
higher-tar Parliament.

I will keep you posted if any additional correspondence
is received.
