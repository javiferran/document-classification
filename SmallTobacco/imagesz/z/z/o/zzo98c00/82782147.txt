Re: Newport. Lights Direct Mail Test

Roland, in working with our Direct Marketing data base, I’ve
identified sufficient Salem smokers in the state of Michigan
to make a. Direct Mail. test. for Newport Lights worthwhile.

In brief, you might want. to consider a test with 5,000+
Salem Family smokers. OMG! would. develop a Direct Mail piece
for Newport Lights.. The objective would be to stimulate
conversion to the brand by educating these consumers about
Newport Lights white tip amd offering money-saving coupons.

Please: advise.
