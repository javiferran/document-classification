Re: Ninth Report on Carcinogens,/ MD EC-14
Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS)

Dear Dr. Jameson:

I understand that the National Toxicology Program is accepting comments for use in its
consideration of a petition to list environmental tobacco smoke (“ETS”) as a “known human
carcinogen” or as being “reasonably anticipated to be a known human carcinogen.” Scientists at
R. J. Reynolds are gathering pertinent information that we believe will assist NIP in its
determination. That information will be forwarded to you shortly by them.

In the meantime, as you may know, a! federal district court recently vacated the 1992
Environmental Protection Agency’s Report on Environmental Tobacco Smoke that sought to
classify ETS as a known human carcinogen. I enclose a copy of the court’s opinion for your
review and consideration as the NTP considers listing ETS.

The opinion begins by discussing the procedures Congress had established for EPA to follow in
its research program on indoor air quality. The court concluded that EPA fell short of complying
with those procedures. The court then, however, reviewed the record to determine whether,
“aside from procedural defects” (page 38),| EPA conducted the risk assessment in accordance
with the Radon Research. Act... The‘core scientific requirements of the Radon Research Act are
identified as “[g]athering all relevant information, researching, and disseminating findings”

(page 90) arid providing “clear, objective information about indoor air quality” (page 91). The ~
TS

court found that EPA’s goal was to name E
objective scientific review.

S a Group A carcinogen, rather than to conduct an

“We work for smokers.”
