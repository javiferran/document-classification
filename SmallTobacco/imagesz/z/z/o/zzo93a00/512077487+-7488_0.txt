The sample of triethylene glycol (TEG) submitted was analyzed for
its pyrolyzates and impurities as follows. A small amount of the sam-
ple was pyrolyzed at two temperatures (700°C and 200°C). ‘the pyroly-
zates were then analyzed by an on-line pyrolysis/GC/MS system. A 60-m
DB-5 fused silica capillary colum was used. ‘The GC colum temperature
was held at 35°C for 5 minutes and then programmed to 280°C at 3°C/min.
The pyrolyzates were identified and are listed with their relative per-
centages as below:

 

z (700°)
15.99 Acetaldehyde
0.05 1,3-Dioxolane
0.26 1,3-Dioxolane, 2-methyl-
0.10 1,4-Dioxane
0.16 ~ Diethylene glycol
82.84 Triethylene glycol

Only a trace amount of 1,4-dioxane was detected at 200°C. Diethylene
glycol and 1,4~dioxane were identified by canparing their mass spectra
and retention times with standard chemicals (Aldrich Chemical Co.).

The triethylene glycol submitted was analyzed for impurities as
follows. A small amount of the sample was analyzed by GC/MS. A 60-m
OV-351 fused silica capillary columm was used. ‘The temperature of the
GC column was held at 35°C for 5 minutes and then programmed to 220%
at. 3°C/min. Only approximately 0.078% of diethylene glycol relative to
triethylene glycol was found.
