TO: MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE

FROM: SAMUEL D. CHILCOTE, JR.

SUBJECT: 1983 HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT
REPORT ON SMOKING AND HEALTH

You have received earlier reports of Institute activity to
meet the 1983 report. This is a supplement to them.

1. A letter from me, with supporting enclosures (see attached
sample) was delivered prior to publication of the report to
each member of Congress.

2. The staff recontacted reporters and news bureau chiefs, who
had undergone staff briefings earlier,-to provide them in
person with copies of the "executive summary" of our
position on smoking and heart disease (copy attached).

3. Following the Brandt-Koop news conference last Thursday at
11, 22 news organizations sought TI response and were given
our brief statement (copy attached). (There were 31 other
media inquiries the same day about the "Great American
Smokeout" and our staff response to that is also attached).

4. Major media coverage was thorough but not flamboyant or
"front-page." The New York Times used a UPI story, in
section D. The Washington Post ran its own story, on page
3. The Wall Street Journal had a modest, inside story.
USA Today gave the report three paragraphs at the end of a
short story on the "Smokeout." On evening TV news
broadcasts Thursday, ABC covered the story in 100 seconds,
CBS 135 seconds, and NBC 110. All had TI's comments, and

the Times, UPI, the Journal and CBS used them. ‘

5. Last Friday, we prepared and distributed (for Sunday
release) a further, hard-hitting and specific rebuttal
statement (copy attached).
