6. The day before the HHS news conference we acquired an
advance copy of the new report and of a major, unpublished
animal study which showed fewer heart disease lesions in
control animals than in those exposed to cigarette smoke.
We found no reference to the study in the report, although
the study was done under an HHS contract. We are now
seeking an investigative reporter will to dig into the
apparent concealment, and to follow certain other leads
which we have which strongly indicate editing of the report
so as to support prior government judgments. We are also
preparing stand-by advertising to deal specifically with
the missing animal study.

We will keep you advised concerning these matters.
