Mayada is correct in her statement regarding conflict of these draft ventilation
guidelines with respect to "adapted" individuals. The ASHRAE comments state
"There is no justification or clarification of why adapted occupants became the
basis for determining ventilation rats. The strongest scientific basis for
determination of ventilation rates is based on unadapted persons. There is no
standard method to determine how an adapted occupant of a space can be satisfied
or dissatisfied with the indoor air quality, particularly in relationship to
other confounding indoor environmental factors.....
We need to resolve this difference. Otherwise I think the guidelines look
great, They sure are expanded in content since our meeting together.
