Material used in a new wet belt has been approved for use by RJR Toxicology, RJR
Germany and Neipmann. One of these belts will be installed on the Neipmann unit in
1-1 this week (8/18). Tobacco from rejects processed after this belt installation
will be collected in strip cans and held until contamination test results are
reviewed. New wet belts for the remaining Neipmann units are expected to arrive
the first week in September,

RJR Toxicology has also recommended the use of a 10% chlorine solution as part of
the Neipmann water replacement and sterilization procedure, Garland Stack and
Ken Smith will pursue with Toxicology the option of using steam cleaning as an

alternative to the chlorine bath.
