Subject: APRIL 2000 MENU ROLL UP

Importance: High
Hello Everyone,

Enclosed is the April 2000 Menu Roll Up spread sheet for the Marlboro B3G2F promotion. There are only
seven items on the list. As a result, the budgets are lower than normal. Other items will be available to
you, however, we estimated quantities because they are equity items that are a continuation from March,
with the same production schedule as March POS. Those items and quantities will be communicated on
the server. Please submit quantities to me by the end of the day 12/12/99. Let me know if you have any
questions.

Doris
