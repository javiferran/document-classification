Grant Application No. 1630; Henry Sershen, New York.

Dr. Sershen is a relatively young investigator who did most of his training
and work at New York University.

This is an application similar to the one we had already in the same bdook which
deals with the mechanism of Parkinson's disease. The previous application
mentioned the fact that smokers seem to have a lesser incidence of Parkinson's
disease. No mention is made of this in the present application. However, he
introduces a new approach, namely that of using a new compound which can give
rise to severe Parkinson's disease in humans. This compound MPTP seems to be
quite effective in this respect and is useful in producing a model in rodents.

His approach is both by chemical and electron microscopy. He is also
interested in determining catecholamine levels in brain tissue, GABA levels
and more interesting, receptor binding properties. So far his results have
not turned up anything, but the potential certainly is there.

The application is a little on the thin side, but in some ways it is refreshing.
I get the impression that this man is young and relatively untried, having
worked primarily with his sponsors at New York University. I would like to
know more about the institute where he is working, :

. In any case despite its thinness, I think it would
be an interesting application. It is relatively inexpensive and there are
no other funds available. I would take a flyer,
