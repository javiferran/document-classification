"MEETING THE CHALLENGES OF THE '90s" will be the theme of the
1990 convention of the Oklahoma Association of Tobacco and

Candy Distributors. What changes will take place in our
industry? In technology? How will your company act - or react -
to meet the competition? ,

You can get off to a head start in this new decade by
attending OATCD's 1990 convention at Fountainhead Resort
Hotel on beautiful Lake Eufaula.

Keynote speaker for the Saturday educational session will be
Dan Burrus, whose subject is "Futureview: A Look Ahead."
Burrus says: "We are poised on the threshold of an era that
will transform the way people live and work. Recent
innovations in science and technology have provided us

with a 'new set of tools' to work with which will greatly
increase our productivity and efficiency in all areas...
Knowing what these tools are and how to apply them
creatively is rapidly becoming a matter of business

survival and a key to personal gain."

We have included two special events for the ladies this
year - a bingo party on Friday afternoon and a luncheon
and fashion show on Saturday.

Our popular casino night will be back again, and humorist
Stan White will entertain you at our Saturday banquet.

A tentative schedule is enclosed to assist you in making
plans.
