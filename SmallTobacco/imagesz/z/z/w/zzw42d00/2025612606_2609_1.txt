These plumes joined above the cigarette into a broadi band of smoke which
moved forward to join the major plume. from the burn.

The total weight. of the two papers of the dual~wrapped cigarettes was

approximately that of the single wrap of heavier paper.

However, the dual-

wrapped cigarettes did not display the sams phenomenon of smoke issuing from
the perforations, although there were rows of holes in the outer paper. The

inner paper was found to have no perforations.

The only smoke seen from

these cigarettes other than that of the major plume was from the end of the

ash or from the filter end.

Videotapes showing six of each of the three types of cigarettes burning
in a static mode are available for viewing in the microscopy lab at normal
speed (over 3 hours of viewing time) or at four time times their normal rate

{about 50 minutes) .

which shows a brief view at normal rate and a full burn. at
for one cigarette of each of the three types.
