Dear Dr. Lisanti:

Jack Frankel asked that 1 write to you with regard to two points
on the coefficient, Yule's Q.

Q is a measure of association between two variables that have each
been classified into dichotomies. Thus it contrasts with the most
conventional measure of association, Pearson's Product-moment Corre-
dation (r),in that the latter relates two variables that are each
measured on continuous interval scales. It compares in that both
measures have a theoretical range from +1.0 to -1.0, representing
perfect direct orinverse associations, respectively.

Pearson's r isbased on the product moments for each data point
represented on a bivariate surface. Thus, it is based on the weighted
sum of signed distance vectors from the bivariate mean. It therefore
requires interval scals measuring the variables.

In contrast, Q does not assume known distances between points
on the scales. Only two points are represented for each variable
(e.g. - high x low, on x off, cancer x non-cancer, etc). The data
are thus classified into four cells (as in the table I sent to Jack).

A fair description of Q may be found in J.H. Mueller and K.F.
