MaJor histocompatibility complex class IJ molecules and their
peptide ligands show unusual interaction kinetics, with slow associ-
ation and dissociation rates that yield an apparent equilibrium
constant of ~10 *-107° M (refs 1-5). However, there is evidence
for a specific, rapidly formed, short-lived complex’. The altered
migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of class II
molecules upon stable peptide binding’ has led to the hypothesis
that the two kinetically distinguishable types of class Il-peptide
complexes correspond to different structures. In accord with this
model, we demonstrate here that insect cell-derived HLA-DR1

FiG, 1 Empty MHC class Hl molecules show both fast-on/fast-off and
slaw-on/slow-off interactions with a single peptide species. a, Peptide—
DR1 complexes were formed by incubation of 0.3 pM sDR1 with 100 pM
+251 labelled HA peptide (HA) for 10 min or 48 h at 37 °C. After each
incubation, peptide-DR1 complexes were separated from free peptide
by spun column filtration and assayed by gamma counting. The kinetics
of dissociation of complexes formed during 10 min of incubation were
followed by subsequent sequentia! spun column separations. Inset (a),
Peptide-OR1 complexes formed by incubation of sSDR1with 100 pM **°1-
labelled HA peptide for 10 min or 48h or with ?5l-labelled HA plus a
10-fold excess of unlabelled HA peptide for 10 min at 37 °C were ana-
lysed by native gel electrophoresis. b, Peptide DR1 compiexes formed
by incubation of sDR1 with varying concentrations of ?**I-HA peptide
for 10 min at 37 °C and analysed by spun column separation. c, Pep-
tide-DR1 camptexes were formed by incubation of sDR4 with 28) HA
peptide for 10 min, 1, 3, 5 and 96h at 37 °C. The kinetics of dissocia-
tian of complexes were measured as in a.

METHODS. Soluble DR1 was produced by L243 mAb-affinity purification.

PH 7.2, at 4 °C. Reverse-phase HPLC-purified HA 306-318 peptide
(PKYVKQNTLKLAT) was labelled with ** using tadabeads (Pierce) and
separated from free iodine by passage through a 3-ml G-15 (Pharmacia)
gel-filtration column. Fractions containing the labelled peptide were
pooled and stored at 4°C. HPLC analysis showed that the +251 label
coincided with the peptide peak. In most experiments the peptide poo!
was vacuum-concentrated to 2.5-3 mM (6-7 x 10°c.p.m. per pl). Pep-
tide concentration was determined by tyrosine absorption or quantita-
tive amino-acid analysis. Reaction mixtures contained sDR1 at 0.3 pM
and, unless otherwise indicated, peptide at 100 2M in PBS in a total
volume of 50 wl. Spun cofumns (BioRad; 0.7 ml, containing BioGel P2)
were blocked using 20% non-fat dry milk in PBS plus 0.02% NaN, and
used according to the manufacturer's recommendation. There was a
linear correlation between the number of fast-farming comptexes and
the concentration of sDR1 used for incubation {S.S.N., unpublished
observations}, which indicates that labelled HA 306-318 binds to sDR1
and not to blocking proteins or other components of the assay system.
For measurement of dissociation rates, peptide and sDR1 were mixed
and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times and passed through a
spun column at room temperature. The excluded volume was collected,
counted, and incubated for the first indicated dissociation time. It was
then reapplied to a spun column and the excluded volume recovered
and counted. This process was repeated to generate the data for the
entire set of dissociation times. Native gel electrophoresis was per-
formed using Mini-PROTEAN II Ready Gels from BioRad as described’.
Dried gels were autoradiographed.
