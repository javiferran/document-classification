We believe an accurate estimate of economic impact
in these areas will require a comprehensive survey of current
practices, a willingness of management to describe their intent
within the discretion of the ordinance, and a technically sound
estimate of construction costs related to partitions and other
structural change requirements. For this reason we believe that
further study should not be undertaken without support from
industry groups (such as The Chamber of Commerce and The South
Florida Hospital Association). It should be noted that this
Support need not be a commitment for or against the ordinance,
but the cooperation that would result from a sincere interest
in understanding the impact of the proposed ordinance.

We have appreciated the opportunity to work with you
and your group and will be pleased to answer, at your convenience
any questions about our work.

Very truly yours,
