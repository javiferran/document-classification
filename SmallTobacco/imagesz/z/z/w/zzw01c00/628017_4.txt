1. Health care

a. Smoking in a hospital provides a tension reliever

for patients and relatives under the stress of
illness.

The no-smoking ban could provide a long-term
Savings in health care if current practices are,
in fact, harmful to health of non-smokers.

There could be an additional cost of admitting
and possible reduction in utilization caused
by trying to match smokers and non-smokers in
semi-private rooms.

2. Hotels, motels, restaurants
ee A EGS

a. There could be a loss (gain) of business to (from)

other counties or states where there are no
limitations on smoking.

There could be a loss in cigarette revenues
which would have to be made up with other
price increases.

There could be a savings in housekeeping expense
caused by fewer ashes and cigarette ends in no-
smoking areas.

A fifty percent ratio for smoking and non-smoking
may not be a proper allocation of tables in a
restaurant.
