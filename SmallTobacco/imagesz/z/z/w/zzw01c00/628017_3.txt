D. Enforcement

As a result of our inquiries and review, a number of
points were raised which related to enforcement costs:

i. we understand that there have been only 2 citations
on the existing no-smoking ordinance (Sec 26A)
which has been in effect since 1973

ii. the maximum fine of $500 would more than offset
the cost of apprehension and prosecution as
defined in the California study

iii. a portion of the burden for enforcement would fall
upon individual citizens (non-smokers and other
persons who object to a violation) exercising
their rights under the ordinance. It is likely
that the majority of these complaints would be
resolved without requirement for prosecution

Based upon the above considerations, we have not
computed an impact for enforcement.

Other considerations

During our surveys of management a number of other
comments were made which could indicate additional areas of
cost impact which were not computed in this study. Following
are a list of these (which we have not attempted to evaluate):
