Subject: Technology Driven New Products Reporting Structure

Jerry:

Currently, the reporting structure for Project TSB consists
of multiple committees and task forces. At the bottom level is a -
working team composed of representatives from various departments ;
who are charged with the responsibility of coordinating day-to- >
day details of the project. This group reports to the TSB Task
Force currently chaired by Bob Lloyd. The Task Force, in turn, “
reports to a Steering Committee composed of Hudnall Christopher, ee
Harry Lees, Dale Sisel, and me. This Steering Committee was —
originally charged with coordination of domestic and internation-
al efforts on TSB/TCF. Recently, a Worldwide Coordination Com-
mittee has been formed to coordinate RJRT, RJRTI, and McCann-
Erickson efforts to introduce a brand based on TSB technology.
The current TSB structure is outlined on the first attachment.

A second project, TGA, is now beginning to develop a similar
Structure. While coordination across departments is necessary,
too much of its exists on TSB, and a similar phenomenon may be
expected with TGA. Attachment 2 outlines a plan to’ replace the
TSB structure and incorporate a reporting system for TGA and
other technologically driven new product projects as well.

Features of this plan are as follows:

o The current TSB Steering Committee and TSB Task Force
will be eliminated. RJRT Executive Officers will
continue to receive reports on TSB and other new
product projects.

o RJRT/RJRTI/McCann~Erickson efforts on TSB will
continue to be coordinated through the Worldwide
Coordination Committee.

o A New Products!' Steering Committee will be formed
to deal with both TSB and TGA. Permanent members of
this Committee will include RJRT representatives of
R&D, New Brands Marketing, Marketing Development,
Process Technology and Development, and Law. Each
