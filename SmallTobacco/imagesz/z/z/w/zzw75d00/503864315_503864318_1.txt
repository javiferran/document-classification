of these representatives will keep his/her

management informed of project status.

Representatives of other departments and RJRTI will
meet with this core group as needed to achieve specific
project objectives. This group will coordinate
development of longer term new brand projects such as
TGA, TSB, SA, AF, and future projects.

The primary responsibility for this committee will be
assumed by the VP of R&D who will report results to
executive management. The VP of New Brands Marketing
will assume responsibility when a project reaches active
New Brand Status. Coordination at this point will occur
through the Brand Management mechanism already in place.

If you concur with the proposed plan, we will implement it.
