Subject: Endotoxin in smoke

Dear Debbie:

At the meeting with Ragnar Rylander on Aug. 24, 1999, we discussed the endotoxin issue. Please
find attached a draft concept on a pilot study to qualitatively and quantitatively ascertain the claimed
endotoxin delivery to cigarette mainstream smoke.

Ragnar has the LAL assay established in his laboratory in a version that allows the distinction of the
endotoxin- and glucan-induced LAL response. He would also be willing to do the tests once Walter
has the material available to do the comparison of unwashed and washed samples.

We further discussed the potential bioassay to determine the biological effect of the washing.
Normally, the response to endotoxin inhalation is the accumulation of polymorphonuclear
leukocytes (PMNL) in the bronchoalveolar space. We found this effect in the bronchoalveolar
lavage of rats exposed to mainstream smoke at concentrations of 100 ug total particulate matterA
or higher. Thus, we think the required biological assay would be at hand at INBIFO/CRC. The
question to be tested would be whether the washing would shift the threshold for the PMNL influx to
higher smoke concentrations. Thus, we would probably use three smoke concentrations for each
type of cigarette. The inhalation period would be 21 days. With approximately 1500 cigarettes per
group and day and some spare cigarettes to test the setup, we would need approximately 110.000
cigarettes per type for a full-blown biological analysis.

| would appreciate your thoughts on that process. If you agree, we then would need to pass the
concept for the pilot study through the concept review board for INBIFO/CRC projects.

 

Best regards,
Hans-Juergen
