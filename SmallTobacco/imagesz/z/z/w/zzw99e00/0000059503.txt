‘SUBJECT: WIS BURN RATE REDUCTION

The previous samples (160001-160006) with 2-3% burn retardants on WTS
failed to change the puff number of RALEIGH KS. We want to evaluate
these and additional retardants at 2-3 tines the previous level.

Please make 30 cartons of each of the following to RALEIGH Ks
specifications using factory RALEIGH KS strip blend (cased) and factory
- WTS. Do not flavor. lap8 Abe ake Mi

We will provide the additive solutions but would Like to be notified
1-2 days in advance of sample’ preparation. We would also like to know
an advance the WIS moisture content (preferably 10-12%). After the
additives have been sprayed, please use heat (rather than ambient
drying) to adjust the WIS moistures to 14%, This should insure better
penetration of the additives into the WIS samples.
