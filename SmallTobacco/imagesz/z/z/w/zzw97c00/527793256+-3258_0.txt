Patti:

I appreciate your attached memo on additional ways to eliminate the clutter in NY, but
the issue for me is that these books that Salem is in are still better suited for Camel,
Kamel and Winston than they are for Salem. I have no intention on lowering the voice of
Camel and Kamel and think it would be a mistake for Winston to pull out of books that
are more non-mentho! driven and edgier. Time-Out is still a great magazine for the brand
and so are all the others mentioned below. All the other books mentioned below should
also stay on plan and have more Camel and Kamel impact. By leaving these books I am
only raising Marlboro's share of voice. I will be fired or I should quit if New York share
for Camel and Kamel does not grow. I have to have better, more impactful advertising.

Salem has a great challenge ahead, but the ONLY thing that will work for Salem is
having more impactful creative. Having Mela - Alem on billboards and POS means
nothing along with the ORB which has no equity. To suggest taking the foot off the pedal
for Camel and Winston with strong equities to make room for Mela - Alem and the Orb is
absolutly wrong. New York if anything needs more Camel impact.

there MAY BE a few more concessions we could make. Things that will not significantly
affect our plans.

Here are some examples. I'd like you to THINK about these, and then we can discuss:

Time Out NY -- we could take KAMEL out of this book. It's not critical to the plan -- and
