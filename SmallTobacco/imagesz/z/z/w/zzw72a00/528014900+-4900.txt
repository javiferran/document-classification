Cattaraugus County, NY--At recent public hearing, county legislators heard five retailers
speak out against the self-service display ban proposal and only one citizen speak for it.
The legislators decided to re-refer the bill to committee because they said it was toa
broad the way it was written. They won't bring it back until after Labor Day at the very
earliest. Over in Chautauqua County, the legislators will consider exempting cigars and
making a "3-foot from the register" exception for smokeless when an amendment is heard
in the next month.

This could give cigarette retailers an opportunity to go back in an maybe at least get some
space on the the counter--not just behind it. The local Rite-Aid drug chain, with five
stores in the county, is mainly pushing for the cigar, smokeless exception.
