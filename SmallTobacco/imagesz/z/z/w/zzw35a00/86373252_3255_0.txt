Strategy Letter: Maverick 3rd Quarter 1999 Workplan Materials
Program #: 99-003M

Objective: Provide targeted impactful point-of-sale materials that support

Maverick’s 1999 creative campaign.

 

Maverick’s “Real Deal” creative campaign will continue for 3rd Quarter workplan
materials.

Overall Strategy: Provide a consistent and cohesive family appearance to all
workplan point-of-sale pieces that are placed both in and outside the store. As

we begin to build Maverick’s long-term brand identity, all workplan pieces will feature
Maverick’s signature Black and Gold colots via:

e Black backgrounds instead of a combination of black and grey backgrounds.
© Maverick’s gold signature icon (either “Maverick” brand name alone or
coupled with the triangular logo and falcon).

Where room permits, “The Real Deal” headline will be used. The supporting tagline,
“Real Taste, Great Deal”, however, will no longer be used. When this tagline was used
on ptevious quarters’ workplans, it connoted mostly a price or value positioning.
Without using the tagline, however, allows consumers to draw their own conchisions
about the brand, like a great quality product or “a brand of cigarettes that’s for me”.

Additionally, photos of Maverick packs will be featured on all pieces that are intended
for placement away from the display (i.e., 2x2 panel holders) to help confirm that
Maverick is a brand of cigarettes.

Tactics:
e Allold quarterly workplan pieces must be removed and replaced with new 3“
quartet workplan materials.

 

® The 4, 6 and 8-wide riser strips that incorporate pricing areas must be used in
conjunction with all 4, 6 and 8-wide riser cards.
