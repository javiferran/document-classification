© To play off “The Real Deal” headline, “Special Deal’ will replace “Special Offer”
in all pricing areas.

© All cardboard riser cards will be printed double sided with the same black and gold
logo/graphics to help improve brand awareness levels whether consumers ate
directly in front of or see the back of the excel display from a store window.

@ To aid in Maverick’s cohesive black and gold family appearance at retail, the
following workplan materials will be eliminated:
>» Menthol Specific pieces (4, 6 and 8-wide lit riser cards; magnetic sign/latge
poster)
> “Try Menthol/Try Non-Menthol” small and large bursts

e However, communication of Mavetick’s packing varieties will be enhanced via:
> Flavor identifiers (Full Flavor, Lights and Menthol wording) added to all
’ channel sttips
>» Two NEW plastic danglets - “Try Menthol” and “Ty Lights”. The current
Maverick price dangler (on special promotion shells) is still available but
with the addition of the Maverick signature logo/falcon icon to enhance
brand name recognition.

© Mechanicals to production by 2/19; quantities to production by 3/12; materials
