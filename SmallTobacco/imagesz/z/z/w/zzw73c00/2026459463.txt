Subject: .- Review of Revised Patent Application - PM #534

We have reviewed the, subject patent application and our comments
and questions are as follows:

1. Pages 6, 7, 10 and Claim #3.........

Molecular weight range should be to 600,000 instead of
300,000 as WSRN 3000 is approximately 600,000.

2. Page 7, line $..........
Change N-750 to N-3000.

What does Patent #3,154,514 (line 24) cover? Manufacture
of Tergitol by Carbide or is this use of Tergitol as a
plasticizer? Note licensing conversations by Howard Kothe
with Carbide regarding use of Tergitol in our formulation.
It is described jn our examples. Any problem anticipated

here?

 

4. Page 11, beginning at line 14 ...,.........

The description of a dilution measuring device is
irrelevant when describing the smoke machine. This section
needs revision.

5. Page 6, line 15........

Can we include Klucel (hydroxypropyl cellulose) CMC and PVP
(polyvinyl prrolidone) here as we are investigating TPM
with respect to a Polyox replacement that should include

peroxide attack. i-
