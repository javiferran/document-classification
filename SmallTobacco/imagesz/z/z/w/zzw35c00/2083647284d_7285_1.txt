KD: As requested, | checked out this site. JAMA captures a number of YSP relevant studies. Here's what's
interesting: | just reviewed the What's New section of Weinberg and some of the articles | printed out in full were
the same articles highlighted on this JAMA site! This means: JAMA is picking up on the same studies we are. For
example:

® Association Between Househotd and Workplace Smoking Restrictions and Adolescent Smoking

© <‘banges in Youth Cigarette Use and Intentions Following Emplementation of a fobaceo Contral Program
tandings From the Morida Youth Fobacco Survey, 1998-2000

© lactors Associated With Tobacco Sales to Minors, Lessons Learned From the FDA Compliance Checks

JAMA also prepares a summary report of the studies and offers the study in abstract, full text and pdf format.

For YSP purposes, it's another source for information. Weinberg seems to be a catch-all, and this site allows us to
see what JAMA considers "hot topics". This site is relevant to our interests. We should check it out every once-in-
a-while to see what studies JAMA is posting on their site. Certainly, we want to make sure we know what they
know.
