MEMORANDUM

Re: Revised Ingredient List

Enclosed for your review is the revised list of
ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes.
The revised format is more "user friendly" than the earlier
chart, but still provides all necessary information.

We are continuing to edit the list. The final draft
will contain approximately the same number of food examples
for each ingredient. Because some of the ingredients are
present in numerous food items, we will delete several of the
examples from the current list.

Please call us by noon on April 12 with any comments
concerning this document. . ay
