It is very significant that 30 of the 42 women were nonsmokers. However, only 4
of the nonsmokers had adeno-caroinoss. We aleo found among the nonsmoking women,
2 equamous-epithelial, 3 solid, 4 polymorphic-cellular, 3 lerge cellular, and 1
ewall celluler carcinoma, Even though these figures are small, they cannot be
completely neglected, Their significance increases if one compares the cigarette
consumption in Austria with the extremely large inorease of bronchial carcinoma
in our country,

The Austria Tabakwerke have been kind enough to put the figures on cigarette.

officially imported cigarettes, Black-market cigarettes which add up to a
significant number only after 1945, have no effect on carcinogenesis because
of the limited tine, since all authors agree that only after 20 to 30 years
does tobacco have any carcinogenic effect. Figure 1 shows the consumption of
cigarette tobacco in grams per year, per head of population,

These figures show that in Austria the consumption of tobacco during the years
which are critical from the point of view of carcinogenesis (effect during
twenty to thirty years) did at first only riee alittle, however, then did de-
crease considerably. For certain reasons there was from 1931 to 1938 a very
active propaganda campaign in favor of nonemoking, The effect of this campaign
ds olearly seen in the declining consumption. The inorease during the last
years is without elgnificance from the point of view of carcinogenesis,
