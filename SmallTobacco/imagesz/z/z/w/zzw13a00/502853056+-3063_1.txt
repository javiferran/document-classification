The effects neem to indicate the carcinogenic effect of cigarette amoking, es-
pecially when the emoke is inhaled, Some authors point to the almost paralle}
curves showing the inorease of cigarette consumption and of bronchial carcinomata.

In Switserland, the consumption of cigarettes has inoreased 1) times from 1924

te 1946 (Gesell), In the United States, the cigarette production (not counting
export cigarettes) has increased per year and per head of population from 46.3

cigarettes in 1903 to 2,54) in 1946 (Ocheaner and collaborators). This increase
4n tobacco consumption runs parallel to the increase in lung cancer,

On the other hand, it is significant that for example jn Iceland where untâ€™i 1939
very few cigarettes were used, cancer of the lung is reletively rors, even tolay,
Only 2.9% of a}] cancers are bronchial caroinomata, while in othe, countries the

proportion is 10 to 20%,

The opinions are divided as to a causal relationship, Frey, 95% of whose patients
with lung cancer were heavy smokers, does not deny this relaticnehin, According
to Gesell, a significant correlation between the excessive use of tovesvo and
bronchial carcinoma is proven. 87.3% of hie patients were heavy smoxers, 2.1%
non amokers, Similarly, Wynder and E, A. Graham come to the conclusion that
heavy smoking during long periods of time (20 to 30 years), especially cigarette
emoking, seems to be an important factor in the genesis of bronchiel carcinoma;
they base these conclusions on detailed investigations, Of 605 mon with lung
cancer, 96.5% were moderately heavy amokers to chain emokers; 94.1% of these
were cigarette emokers, while only 3.5% to 4% were cigar or pipe smokers. Es-
pecially squamous epithelial carcinoma seems to be caused by heavy amoking
While there was no way of finding a relationship between adeno~carcinoma and
tobacco consumption.

Several authors have tried to use the percentage of emokers in men free from
cancer to prove the carcinogenic effect of tobacco. In effest, the proportion
of heavy and very heavy smokers in men free from canoer has been found to be
much less (13.5% to 19.1%) according to Wynder and Graham, Levin and Goldstein,

We have questioned 757 of a total number of 1,145 patients with Jung cancer on
their smoking habits. The results are summarized in Table 1.

Zable
Nonemokers 10.8%
Light amokers (up to 10
cigarettes per day) 30.0%
Moderately heavy smokers
(up to 20 cig, per day) 30.8%
Heavy smokerea (more than
20 clgerettes per day) 28.4%

(Ow patients: 757 with Cancer Bronchi)

This tabulation ahows, contrary to some other papers, & significantly low per-
centage of heavy smokers, while the proportion of nonsmokers and light smokers
