OBJECT:

To report a conversation at the 18th Tobacco Chemists' Research
Conference and subsequent information concerning a papaya cigarette.

SUMMARY:

Information concerning a cigarette made of papaya leaves was
obtained through conversation with a man from Roswell Park Memorial
Institute. This information has been verified and documented.

MEMORANDUM:

During the course of the banquet at the 18th Tobacco Chemists'
Research Conference, Mr. Raymond J. Shamberger of Roswell Park
Memorial Institute offered the observation that he was smoking his
"first tobacco cigarette in over a year."" Subsequent conversation
revealed that he had been employed by a Los Angeles firm as a
biochemist to assist in developing a cigarette made of papaya leaves.
This firm is backed by several very wealthy movie stars. The
cigarette is to be marketed within a few months through the Frito-
Lay Corporation which is a nationwide distributor of food stuffs,
particularly potato chips and Fritos.

Within the past year Mr. Shamberger was employed by Roswell
Park Memorial Institute as a biochemist. He is one of a staff of
about 20 assigned to work on the question of tobacco and health.
Apparently studies of the papaya cigarette were (or are) also made
at Roswell Park.

A subsequent check of the corporate structure of Frito-Lay
(Standard and Poor, September 18, 1964) showed its relation to
Sutton Research Corporation of Los Angeles "to conduct and evaluate
consumersâ€™ tests and technical research on a non-tobacco cigarette
made from papaya leaves. Frito-Lay has option to acquire 51% of
Sutton."
