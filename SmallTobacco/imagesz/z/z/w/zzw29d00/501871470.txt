Mr. W. R. Lybrook:

With reference to the attached letter from
Mr. Croce, you can tell him that we do not add any
oxidizing agents to our tobaccos and insofar as we
know, neither do any of our competitors. Therefore,
nothing is added to tobacco to increase the rate of
burning.

Some cigarette papers do contain a very small
amount of additive to increase the burning rate of the
paper only so that it will burn evenly with the tobacco
and prevent cigarettes from "going out".

I am attaching also a photocopy of an
article that appeared in TOBACCO concerning "measure-
ment of the combustion-zone temperature of cigarettes".
It is to be noted that the combustion-zone temperature
is held within a narrow range regardless of the many
variables. Our own work confirms the results which are

reported,

I am returning Mr. Croce's letter herewith.
