RR II Scripting

McMahon, Kathy

Briggs, Gary(Kowal); Grosskopf, Neil; Mansmann, Jack

Can we verify that the scripting is correct regarding how often retailers can call to order
catalogs.

CSRs should say that a retailer can call to order catalogs once a day. In the beginning of the
last program we said once a week. We were concerned about not having sufficient catalog
inventory. since proved not to be an issue so we can allow retailers to call and order catalogs
more often - once a day.

Thanks.
