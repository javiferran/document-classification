Dear John:

Your secretary called today to inquire if we
had received the large mouse holders and the small
hamster cone holders. These did arrive and we are
conditioning a large group of mice to them.

We will start a trial run with the regular
reference cigarette next week,

Our best to you.

@ Sincerely yours,

P.S. We have the small holders wrapped in plastic
bags. Would you like these returned to P&I Corp.?
