Program Type: DM/Coupon
Program Title: Chattanooga Holiday Mailing

Description: This will be a simple coupon mailing (envision a roll-fold self-
mailer, mailed from the printer) that delivers a thank-you/holiday message while
reaffirming the benefits of Eclipse. This will be sent to the Sneak Previews

attendees, seed file names, and top 2 box interceptees. Coupons to expire
1/31/97.

Rationale: 1) If possible on a timing issue, may be able to affect our
Nov. 21 share read
2)Continue to maintain a presence among potential Eclipse
purchasers and give them an incentive to purchase the
brand
3)Maintain reasonable price gap strategy in light of that
program's cancellation

Timing: ASAP

Quantities: Approximately 12,000
--4300 Sneak Previews attendees
--1500 seed mail file
--6000 intercept top 2 box (may be a high estimate,
particularly if we cannot use the names from the first
round of intercepts)

Contact: Brand Jule Banzet
Agency TBD
Cost: TBD
