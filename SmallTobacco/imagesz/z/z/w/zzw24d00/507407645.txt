Dear Greg:

I am sure you recognize the extent to which our future success depends on
decisions made by elected officials in Washington and the state capitals.
Anti-tobacco groups. are intensifying their efforts to achieve a "smoke-free
society," and supporters of our industry in Congress and the state
legislatures are finding it more difficult and politically costly to take a
stand on our behalf.

If we are to improve the legislative climate, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco must
dramatically increase its |involvement in the political process. We must
continually ask elected officials for their support, and it is vital that we
be in a position to support them in return. As you know, the RJR Political
Action Committee is the only means available for our company to financially
support candidates who will consider our views intelligently and fairly.
However, for a variety of reasons, current PAC receipts are inadequate to
meet our increasing needs,

The RJR PAC deserves your |most serious consideration and attention. Parti-
cipation in the PAC is voluntary, and no rewards or penalties are involved,
but any management employee who is unwilling to make an investment in R. J.
Reynolds Tobacco’s future |by supporting the PAC fails to recognize the
importance of the challenges we face in the political process.

Enclosed is a membership form and a return envelope. The suggested contri-
bution rate is .5% of gross salary, and payroll withholding is the preferred
method of participation.

I am confident that you will join me in supporting the PAC. If you are
already contributing, but at less than the suggested rate, I encourage you
to consider increasing your level of support.

Sincerely,

——
