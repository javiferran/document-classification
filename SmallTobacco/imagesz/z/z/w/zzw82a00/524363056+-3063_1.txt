Gray Market (U.S, manufactured)

Activity to Date

Federal prohibition against importation goes into effect 1/1/2000, BATF is drafling regulations, and RIR
has commented on them during the drafting. RJR successfully lobbied Congress for $5.2 million for
BATE. RJR has shared general information with other manufacturers, with state government officials,
and has raised Congressional awareness of the problem.

Brought suit against gray market diverters.
State legislation has passed in 24 states.

RIR is changing all export labeling in the US and Puerto Rico to make it non-compliant with federal
labeling requirements.

Gaps and Weaknesses
Have to rely on other manufacturers to protect their trademarks (PM/Marlboro) or make their export

labels non-compliant.
Grandfathered product.
Timing of implementation of federal regulations.
Priority and resources for enforcement agencies.
Problems with state legislation (California, for example).
Legislation not yet passed in 26 states.
What Can be Done
Pass gray market legislation in remaining 22 MSA states and 4 non-MSA states.
- Seck to amend existing gray market legislation where necessary, to tighten
compliance/enforcement.
Seck to modify model legislation to address:
- private right of action;
- import license requirement,
- increased penalties;
- ingredients disclosure,
- retailer accountability.

Push for earmarked appropriations in fedcral/states for enforcing gray market laws.

Seek to modify/strengthen ATF regulations on:
- relanded products;
