Issue Areas

New entrants and NPMs

Issue: Non-Participating Manufacturers (including new entrants) can sell at a significant discount to
Participating Manufacturers. NPMs have a greater advantage in states that do not have legislation
requiring escrow payments (Exhibit T of the MSA). Indian tribes are using their sovereignty to avoid
MSA payments.

Current size of business: 3-4% of industry (estimated). Over 3% is SPMs (Subsequent Participating
Manufacturers).

States which have passed Exhibit T: 35.

The largest NPM is Star.

Gray Market (U.S, manufactured)

into the U.S. Such export product sells at a significant discount to domestic product. The importer
arbitrages the price difference.

Includes Allied, Prestige, Cigarettes Cheaper.

Current size of business: Difficult to quantify, but sources estimate 1-3% of industry (est) and growing.
Largest markets are South Florida, Southern California.
