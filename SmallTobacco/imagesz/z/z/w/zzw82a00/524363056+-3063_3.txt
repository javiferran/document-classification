Gray Market (Foreign manufactured U.S. brands)

Activity to Date. Ongoing discussions with JT to ensure compliance with our contract.
Researched PM exports packaging practices. If the destination country has no health warning
requirement, PM uses the US warning language, but adds the phrase "U.S. Surgeon General” in place of

"Surgeon General."

Gaps and Weaknesses.
Have to rely on other manufacturers to protect their trademarks (PM/Marlboro).

Federal law cannot ban legitimate, conforming product.

Federal and slate gray market laws do not make this activity illegal.

Tariffs cannot be increased.

What Can be Done

Amend state gray market legislation to cover product that does not conform to federal labeling and
reporting requirements.

Obtain proposed federal import license regulations and insure regulations are as strong and effective as
possible.

Push FTC 1o interpret FCLAA strictly: verbatim warning statements.

Report ingredients disclosure, other reporting violations to federal and state authorities.
Enforcement Opportunities.

Focus Customs and ATF on strictly enforcing labeling and reporting requirements.

Participating Manufacturers, retailers can report the existence of Non-Participating Manufacturers to
state authoritics to assist the states in collecting escrow payments.

Encourage AGs to impress on all manufacturers the importance of defending their trademarks.

Legal Options
Bring trademark suits to stop the inflow of product that infringes on our marks.

Consider an ITC action.

Hold JT to its agreement to keep out infringing product.
