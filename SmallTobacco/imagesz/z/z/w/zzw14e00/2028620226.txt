OBJECTIVES

To isolate, count and identify microorganisms that can be
found on different tobaccos: and to screen them for their
ability to denitrate tobacco extract.

STATUS

Denitration : The isolated yeast strains. Nos. 1011, 1014
and 1018 were re-tested for growth: and denitration in
tobacco extract and in. yeast extract / peptone / dextrose
broth. â€˜The growth rates in tobacco extract were between
0.2.45 and 0'.6 hr ~ and in yeast extract between 0.65 and
0.8 hr -, .

Strain 1011 was used for a. growth and denitration trial. in

the: fermentor. The trial. was not successful. A reason
may be that on the contrary to the shaken flask trials, the
PH was controlled. Agitation and aeration were also very.
ditferent. The: trial will. be repeated.

Identification : Identification of the isolatedi yeasts was
terminated. finally, 11 strains. out of the 25 were found
to be identical.

Bacteria : A minimal (salt) medium, supplied with nitrate
or nitrite as a mitrogen source and ethanol as a carbon
source, was used to isolate denitrating an ,denitrifying
bacteria both aerobically and anaerobically. Different
strains were: isolated and are currently being; tested to
determine their characteristics (2).

Plans : Repeat the denitration trial. in the fermentor
using strains 1011, 1014 and ioue?.
- Test Lsolated bacteria for denitration. /
denitrification.
- Isolate bacteria at higher temperatures.
- Continue efforts for the identification of
bacteria.
