induced DNA damage. Defects in radiation response

pathways is a contributor to neoplastic predisposition in

patients with XP or AT. XP patients have a high incidence

- of skin tumours (Friedberg et al., 1978) and approximately

10% of AT patients develop lymphoid malignancies
(Kersey ef al., 1973). In addition, radiation is a potent
inducer of leukemias and lymphomas in mice. For
example, in BALB/c mice, lymphomas typically develop
6 months following heavy (>6800 rad over four weeks)
irradiation (Haran-Ghera and Peled, 1979). On the other
hand, C57BL mice develop thymic lymphomas
approximately 200 days after 4 doses of 170 rad whole-
body irradiation (Okumoto et al., 1990). In the p53
transgenic mice, nearly one third of the irradiated mice
developed tumours within 10 weeks of irradiation. The
extremely rapid kinetics of appearance of radiation-induced
tumours in the transgenic animals suggests that the wild-
type p53 protein normally plays a critical role in
suppressing radiation carcinogenesis. Moreover, p53 is
also crucial in the suppression of chemical carcinogenesis,
and mice with either homozygous of heterozygous p53
deletions show an increased susceptibility to tumours
induced by dimethylbenzathracine (Harvey ef al., 1993b)
and dimethylnitosamine (Kemp et al., 1993).

it is interesting to note that the spectrum of tumours
induced by radiation in the p53 transgenic mice was quite
distinct from those which develop spontaneously in these
mice or in irradiated normal mice. While lung
adenocarcinomas, lymphomas, and osteosarcomas
constitute 67% of the spontaneous tumours in p53
transgenic mice (Lavigeur et al., 1989) only two of the

~ radiation-tumours were of these tumour types (lymphoma).

This dissimilarity between the spontaneous and radiation-
induced tumour spectra suggests that there may be tissue-
specific differences in the importance of p53-mediated
pathways of radiation carcinogenesis suppression.
Furthermore, while haematopoietic malignancies are
normally associated with radiation-carcinogenesi8, only
two of the radiation-induced tumours in the transgenic
mice were lymphomas, while sarcomas (5/10)

predominated. The CD1 genetic background of our,

transgenic mice may play some role in determining
susceptibility to radiation-induced haematopoietic
neoplasms, or it may be that haematopoietic malignancies
require a longer latency period than were allowed for i in
these experiments. =

Itis generally accepted that progression into neoplasia is a
multi- stage process requiring the accumulation. of
progressive genetic alteration within the same cell (Ben-
David and Bernstein, 1991; Fearon and Vogelstein, 1991).
Radiation, like other DNA damaging agents, increases
oncogenic predisposition presumably by increasing the rate
at which genetic damage accumulates. In mice which
express a mutant p53 transgene, loss of p53 function leads
not only to increased levels of DNA damage, but also to an
elevated predisposition to radiation carcinogenesis. Thus,
it seems likely that one mechanism through which wild-

Materials and Methods

Transgenic and p53 null mice.

The p53rr!93 and p53°2!35 transgenic mice each contain a
14 kb p53 genomic fragment and have been previously’
described (Lavigeur et al, 1989). Animals hemizygous for
either of the p53pre!93 and p53¥4ll35 transgenes have an
abnormally high incidence of lung, bone, and lymphoid
tumours (Lavigeur et al, 1989). Knockout mice with either
homozygous (-/-) or heterozygous (+/-) p53 null mutations
have also been previously described (Donehower et al.,
1992). These knockout mice, like the transgenic mice,

have a high incidence of spontaneous tumour development
(Donehower et al., 1992).

Irradiation of mice and micronuclei measurement.

Transgenic mice and their wild-type littermates were
subjected to two doses of 300 rad of -y-radiation each in a .
Cs g-irradiator at a rate of 7300 rads/hr (1 rad-0.01 Gy).
Mice were bled one day prior to irradiation and three days
following each of the 300 rad treatments. Approximately :
200 pl of blood was collected from the tail vein into 500 pl
of room temperature 500U/ml heparin/PBS (Organon
Teknika, Toronto, Canada). 100 pl of the blood/heparin
mixture was then fixed in 2 ml of -70°C methanol (Fisher
HPLC grade), and subsequently stored at -70°C.
Following completion of the radiation regimen, the fixed
blood samples were shipped on dry ice to Litron
Laboratories (Rochester, N.Y.) for analysis. The fixed
RBCs were then stained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma), and
the number of normal and micronucleated RBCs counted
by fluorescent flow cytometry using a 363 nm laser beam
from a 5W Argon Ion laser, as previously described
(Tometsko et al., 1992). Micronuclei counting was
performed blind.
