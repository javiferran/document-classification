The p53 tumour suppressor gene is an important
participant in the cellular response to ionizing radiation
and other DNA damaging agents. Cells which lack p53
are unable to arrest cell cycle or enter inte apoptotic
cell death following irradiation. Moreover, these p53
deficient cells exhibit an increased resistance to DNA
damaging agents, including radiation. The significance
of this radiation-resistance and its relationship to the
role that p53 plays in tumour suppression and the
cellular radiation response has not yet been determined.

In this report we have analyzed p53 deficient mice, -

expressing either a mutant p53 transgene or having a

- targeted p53 null allele, in order te investigate the role

that p53 plays in governing susceptibility to radiation-
carcinogenesis and in controlling the in vive
accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities. We show
that wild-type p53 plays a critical role in controlling
susceptibility to -y-radiation-induced tumorigenesis, and
sarcomas and lymphomas rapidly appear in irradiated
p53 transgenic mice. Moreover, this susceptibility to
radiation-carcinogenesis is associated with a two-fold
increase in the in vivo accumulation of radiation-
induced double stranded chromosomal breaks relative
to that observed in wild-type animals. Taken together,
these observations suggest that p53 acts to suppress
tumour formation in vive by preventing the
accumulation of cells that have sustained radiation-
induced DNA damage. ,

 

Introduction

The genetic damage caused by both ionizing and non-
ionizing radiation plays an important role in neoplastic
development. The eukaryotic cellular response to radiation
is multi-faceted and involves, in part, a cell cycle arrest at
the GI/S or G2/M boundary (Kuerbitx er a/, 1993) and an
apoptotic pathway of programmed cell death (Cohen ef al.,
1992). The delay in cell cycle progression presumably
allows time for the repair of damaged DNA prior to
replication or division, while apoptosis may be a
mechanism to eliminate genetically damaged cells. Recent
evidence has suggested that p53 , which plays an important
role in suppressing tumour formation in a wide variety of
tissues (Levine et al., 1991; Lane & Benchimol, 1990), is
additionally centrally involved in of the cellular response to
radiation (Lee ef al., 1994), and in controlling the
radiation-induced GI/S cell cycle arrest (Kuerbitx er al,
1993) and apoptosis (Lowe et al., 1993; Clarke ef al.,

1993).

Exposure to ionizing (Kastan et al., 1991; Lu and Lane,
1993) or non-ionizing (Lu and Lane, 1993) radiation -
causes an increase in the intracellular levels of p53, most
likely due to post-transcriptional stabilization of the p53
protein (Kastan et al., 1991). The p53 protein is a
transcription factor (Fields and Jang, 1990; Raycroft er al,
1990; O’ Rourke ef al., 1990, Santhanam ef al., 1991;
Ginsberg et a/., 1991; Farmer et al., 1992), and the
radiation-induced increase in p53 levels leads to a
transcriptional upregulation of the p21¢!P! gene (Dulic et
al., 1994). p21C!P! was initially identified as a gene
regulated by p53 (El-Deiry e@ al., 1993) and as a protein
which interacts with the cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk)
Cdk2 (Harper et al., 1993). The cyclical activation and
inactivation of Cdks regulates cell cycle progression
(Ohutsubo & Roberts, 1993), and p21C!P! is a potent
inhibitor of Cdk 1, 2 and 4 function (Harper et al., 1993).
Cdk 2 becomes activated late in G1 and a complex between
active Cdk2 and cyclin Eis required for commitment into
§ phase (Ohtsubo & Roberts, 1993). p53 dependent up-
regulation of p21C!P! causes a direct inhibition of cdk 2
activity, resulting in cell cycle arrest at the GUS border.
Cells which lack p53 function continue cycling through
GI/S after irradiation and halt cell cycle only at G2/M,
suggesting that both p53 and p21CF! play necessary roles
in a radiation-induced GI/S cell cycle checkpoint

- (Kuerbitx et al., 1992).

In addition to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis is a frequent
consequence of the exposure of mammalian cells to +-
radiation (Cohen ef al., 1992). p53 can induce apoptosis in
a variety of diverse cell types, and also plays a necessary
role in a pathway of radiation-induced apoptosis in
immature mouse thymocytes (Lowe et al., 1993; Clarke er
al., 1993). One of the consequences of the loss of this p53
dependent, radiation-induced pathway of apoptosis is that
cells from p53 deficient animals become highly resistant to
the killing effects of -y-radiation (Lee and Bernstein, 1993;
Lotem and Sachs, 1993). This radio-resistant phenotype
associated with loss of p53 function may be one
mechanism by which tumours with p53 mutations acquire
resistance to radio-therapy and other chemo-therapeutic
agents (Lowe ef al., 1993b). ;

The importance of p53 in both tumour suppression and

_ the radiation-response suggests that the two may be

intimately related. The carcinogenic properties of radiation
presumably stem from its ability to cause DNA damage.
Thus, p53 may suppress tumour formation, in part, by
preventing the accumulation of DNA damage. Consistent
with this idea, cultured fibroblasts lacking p53 have .
elevated levels of polyploidy (Harvey et al., 1993) and
gene amplification in vitro (Livingstone et al., 1992; Yin
et al., 1992). However, the effect that p53 loss has on in
