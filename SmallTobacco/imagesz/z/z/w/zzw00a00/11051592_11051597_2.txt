-y-radiation. The mice were bled prior to irradiation (day 1),
and on the following day given the first 300 rad dose (day
2). Three days later (day 5), the mice were again bled and
on day 6 the mice were irradiated a second time. The third
and final bleed was performed on day 9. The three day
interval between radiation and bleeding was included in the
experimental protocol to allow time for the micronuclei in
marrow erythroid progenitors to appear in the peripheral
blood. Blood samples were assayed for the presence of
MNC, as described in the Materials and Methods. As
shown in a representative experiment in Figure 2A, a ps3
transgenic mouse accumulated markedly more micronuclei
following radiation than its wild-type littermate. A
summary of the average effect of 600 rad of total body -y-
radiation on micronuclei number in p53p'!93 transgenic
and control mice is shown in Figure 2B. After 600 rad of
radiation, the p53 transgenic mice had an average of 980
MNC/106 RBCs, a value which is significantly (»<0.005)
higher than the average 430 MNC/ 10° RBC observed in
non-transgenic control mice. p53%!!35 transgenic mice also
exhibited an increased accumulation of micronuclei
compared to their non-transgenic littermates (data not
shown).

In order to determine whether this increased accumulation
of MNC following irradiation was a unique property

associated with expression of mutant p53 alleles, we
performed identical experiments on mice which were
homozygous (p53-/-) or heterozygous (p53+/-) for targeted
null alleles of the p53 gene (Donehower ef al., 1992). As

“ shown in a representative experiment in Figure 3A,.pS3 -/-

mice accumulated more micronuclei following irradiation
than either their p53 +/+ littermates or heterozygous ps3
+/- mice. The differences between the baseline
micronuclei levels between the p53. transgenic mice and
littermates (Figure 2A) and the p33 null mice and
littermates (Figure 3A) may reflect genetic differences
between the CD1 genetic background of the transgenic
mice and the C57BL6 background of the knock-out mice.
As summarized in Figure 3B, p53 -/- animals, exposed fo
600 rad of -y-radiation, accumulated an average of 3800
micronuclei, which was significantly higher (p<0.002) than
the 1100 MNC increase observed in both the -/+ and +/+
animals. It is noteworthy that p53 +/- animals are not as
susceptible to radiation-induced DNA damage
accumulation as the -/- animals. Taken together, Figures 3
and 4 demonstrate that mice expressing a mutant p53
transgene or homozygous for a targeted p53 deletion
are more susceptible than their wild-type littermates to
the accumulation of radiation-induced chromosomal
damage. ‘ .
