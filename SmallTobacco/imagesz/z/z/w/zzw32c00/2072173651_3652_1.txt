Cons
The Swiss company's purchase of the TM's should be at least equal to the
projected royalty income for the brands.

Such purchase price might reflect the possibility of attaining 1% market
share in the U.S.A. (Basis of $150 million valuation for tax purposes)

The purchase price would have to be apportioned among the actual
beneficial TM holders.($150 million may not have been so apportioned)

The Swiss company, whether or not a subsidiary or RG, would be in fact
under their control. This could be misinterpreted as an attempt to cover
up the situation rather than rectify it.

PM ceases sales of the brands but retains formal license nights
It is known that such steps will not increase the chances of success in

the tax situation. If such a decision is taken, there are two ways to
implement it. The various regions believe an orderly transfer of the
business to RI could be done within 30 to 60 days.

A — PM Sublicenses RE
In this arrangement, PM would receive a royalty from RI and would pay its
contractual royalty to RG. The royalty charged RI must exceed the
royalty paid to RG unless our tax position is to be severely undermined.
This would parallel the situation now existing with Lane Limited for
smoking tobacco. Further, PM would still have an ongoing financial
relationship with RG.

B ~— RG directly licenses RI and Lane Limited
PM wold not be involved in this matter. PM would retain the right to
resume sales and distribution under the existing license agreement with
RG upon appropriate notice. By this method, PM would have no continuing
financial connection with RG with respect to these brands on to their
sale in the U.S.A. and Latin America/Caribbean.

Both of these possibilities have been discussed with representatives of
RG.
