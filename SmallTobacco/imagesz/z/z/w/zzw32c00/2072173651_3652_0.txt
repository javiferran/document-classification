Sale of “Rothmans" brands by Philip Morris under
license in the U.S.A. and Latin America/Caribbean

As you know, Philip Morris Incorporated has a license from Rembrandt
Group Limited, whereby Philip Morris may exploit certain cigarette brands
in the U.S.A. and Latin America/Caribbean.

For calendar year 1985, the sales results for all thase licensed brands
have been:

Volume (Units)

U.S.A. 162,179,720
U.S.A. Duty —- Free 102,740,400
Export to Latin America/Caribbean 67,610,000

TOTAL 332,530,120

The cigarettes have been made for Philip Morris on a contract manufacture
basis by Rothmans Canada, Rothmans International and Liggett Group. The
marginal contribution after contract manufacture, but befora any
expenses, is approximately $9 per 1000 cigarettes i.e. almost $3
million. The royalty owed to “Rembrandt” on such cigarette sales is
$96,337.14 for calendar 1985.

There is also the smoking tobacco sublicense from Philip Morris to Lane
Limited. On these sales, Philip Morris Incorporated retains $90,907 in
royalty income, while a royalty of $45,453.50 has been paid to Rembrandt
Group's U.S.A. subsidiary Larus & Brother Company.

New License from Swiss company

There has been some concern about Philip Morris Ineorporated's continued
participation as the seller and distributior of these cigaratte brands.
A suggestion has been made to substitute a new licenson (i.8. 4a Swiss
company). This option has been examined, but appears extremely
complicated and impractical. The only feasible way to arrange this
license from a Swiss Company would be via a New Agreement. A new license
agreement from a Swiss company would have the following effects.

Pro
Bo continuing license or distribution relationship with a South African
company.
