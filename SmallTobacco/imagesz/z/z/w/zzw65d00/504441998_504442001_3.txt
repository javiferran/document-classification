Winston 100 Menthol

Currently, tests are being conducted to provide two products for NFO testing.
One product will have increased menthol. The other product will have menthol
delivery and taste more like Kool.

Vantage Menthol

Tests conducted on Vantage Menthol attempting to obtain more uniform menthol
in smoke deliveries throughout its normal shelf-life period indicate that SCS-II
(reduced weight) filters with Carbowax should be beneficial. Currently cigarettes
with modified top dressing are being evaluated in conjunction with Carbowax con-
taining SCS-II filters. ,

Another test has been prepared to establish the optimum menthol level with
the modified flavor. We may not have the answer on optimum menthol levels by
May lst, but tests conducted to date with regular menthol level and modified flavor
look favorable,

Increased G-8

Factory Test 177 (Days Work), 178 (Brown's Mule), and 179 (Apple) have been
processed to evaluate plug tobaccos with 14 and 16 percent added G-8. Days Work
and Brown's Mule are currently out on Company-wide panels. Analytical tests
indicated that the Apple test was not suitable for panel testing due to one part
of the test having considerably higher nicotine than the other parts. Factory

Test 179 will be re-made,
