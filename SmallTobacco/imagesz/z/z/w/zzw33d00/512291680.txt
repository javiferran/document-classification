RJR Interoffice Memorandum

BRIGHT 85/100 Date: January 4, 1984
1984 Flavor Development

Dr. D. L. Roberts ( & From: R. F. McCarthy

Tne recent visit to Biddle Sawyer was very encouraging with regard to the
improved flavor components which were reviewed for the BRIGHT filter flavor
system. The deterpinated hearts of peppermint represent a giant step for-
ward in the fact that they will move us closer to a filter flavor system
which can be quantitatively/qualitatively monitored. Although we are at an
impasse at this time in being able to monitor the current filter flavor sys-
tem, it is imperative that we not lose sight of this objective in 1984. It
is requested that all filter flavor development work be directed toward
simplifying and reducing the number of flavor components added to the fil-
ter. A revised flavor system with only peppermint hearts in the filter
would be of the greatest interest in recognition of the current dilenma of
not being able to monitor peppermint on our current products.

In addition to the present flavor improvement work which is currently under-
way, it is requested that the aforementioned approach be assigned a level of
importance and priority that is commensurate with any flavor improvement
work in 1984.

Please advise if there are any questions or concerns.
