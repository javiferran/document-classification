“Studies are reported of a pair of 27-year old identical twins,
, one of whom presented with an acute myocardial infarction. Because the
twine are identical not only in their genetic constitution and strong
femily bistory of coronary heart disease, but also in type of job,
obesity end overindulgence in food, alcohol and tobacco, it is assumed
that they are similarly affected by atherosclerosis.

"A variety of studies were performed, including tests of cardise
physiology, blood coagulation and intermediary metabolism, in an effort
to find deviations from the norwal which might be associated with the

development of atherosclerosis et such 4n early age. Results of tests
of cardiovascular function and of the blood coagulation systen vere vithin
hormal limits in the healthy twin.

“The serwa lipid and lipoprotein patterns were abnormal in
Voth twins. The biochemical responses to test loads of fat and glucose
were slightly outside the normal range.

“It 1s suggested thet the findings are representative of a
| subtly abnormal metabolic response to the stress of chronic overnutrition
in inherently susceptible persons. Evidence is needed to determine whether
ot 4p linked impairment of fat and carbohydrate tolerance is prognostic of
the premature development of atherosclerosis."
