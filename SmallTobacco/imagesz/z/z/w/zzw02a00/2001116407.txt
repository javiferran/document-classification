CHARGE NUMBER: Project. 1901

PROJECT TITLE: Biochemical Modification of Tobacco
PERIOD COVERED: September 1-30, 1985

PROJECT LEADER: 0D. M. Teng

DATE OF REPORT: October 7, 1985

I. Flue Curing Studies

Objective: Alter conventional flue curing condition by maintaining
sufficient moisture in the leaf at elevatedi temperature to enhance the leaf
proteases activities so the modification of leaf protein will be more
complete.

Status: Total of four sets of experiments were completed. Test curings
were conducted at high temperature-high humidity condition for different
periods of time. The lamina and stems were then directly dried, using the
conditions for normal stem drying.

Plans: 1. Stem the samples

2. Chemical analyses.
3. Biochemical evaluations.
4, Subjective evaluations.

II. Air Curing Studies

Objectives: To determine the effect of moisture on air-curing of burley
tobaccos.

Status: Burley tobacco plants were stalk-cut and hung in chambers, with
four moisture levels, for air-curing. Air-curing willl continue for the next
six to eight weeks.

Plans: . Complete the air curing.

» Sample during different stages of curing.
» Chemical analyses.

- Subjective evaluations.

III. Direct Utilization of Tobacco

Objective: To determine the feasibility of producing acceptable smoking
materials with improved chemical, biochemical andi subjective characteristics
without going through conventional curing.

Status: Control and Ethryl-treatedi tobaccos were dried andi shredded.
Stemming, drying and shredding were conducted by the Development personnel.

Plans: 1. Tobacco materials will be treated under different conditions and
then submitted for chemical, biochemical and subjective

evaluations.
