Dear Roz:

First of all, we miss you. The SAB continues to roll
along, but your wisdom and humor were always admired. Now, I
need the wisdom especially.

It is possible that at some time in the future there
may be some legal action which would touch CTR. We need
someone of stature who would be willing to plainly state the
facts, i.e., that the research supported by CTR over the years
was never influenced by our sponsors and that the award of
funds for biomedical research were made with total objectivity
by the SAB. No one is better qualified to do this than you
are.

Frankly, this matter may never come up. The first
anticipated possibility of needing such testimony is some two
or three years in the future. However, our lawyers do want to
know whom they might call upon, and I hope you will agree to do
this.

Needless to say, you would be reimbursed for your time
and expenses in connection with anything of this sort.

If you feel that you would be able to help me; I would
appreciate it if you would send along a copy of your current
curriculum vitae and bibliography. I will in turn pass them
along to our attorneys.

I hope that you and Lou are doing well and I send my
warmest personal regards always. Thanks and all best wishes.

Sincerely,
Ly
