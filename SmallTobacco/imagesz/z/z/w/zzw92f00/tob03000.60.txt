Dear Leonard:

Are you_aware that AMA has agreed to an industry propos
to turrover to C.T.R. the substantial “funds left from thé ho
ERF project? If not, consider it my fault, but no harm £624

done.

 

Leo Brown is working now on publishing a final report {including
abstracts. That will be the next big expense. In the fall
the turnover should occur.

Which brings me to the point and I am putting this in writing
so that you can tuck it into your guture file: I think

there ought to be a photograph and news release at the time of
the transaction which, if Add is willing, you could perhaps
work wee out with the Chicago boys.

Cordially,

 

se Cae William Kloepfer, Jr.
