* Joe's status as the Brand icon is firmly established. A large number of attendees
objected to the blatant hauling of product, yet all groups played back that the ads sell
cigarettes and the sport depicted. In short Joe holding a dominant pack is not a
mandatory.

¢ The overall impression is that Joe can be a participant or an active spectator. Key
learning is that the current ads are relevant and compatible with the current general
market personality. Of the 4 current ads, the CAMEL GT and CAMEL Pro executions
were deemed the most compelling.

* The Smooth Magazine concept elicited spirited, emotional responses from every group.
The enthusiasts and better educated attendees endorsed the overall concept while the
remaining consumers disconnected due to the perceived complexity of the concept.

The most salient comments involved ensuring the accessibility of the characters
(CAMEL Joe is too aloof, too European, snobbish) and the need to keep Joe the hero.
One group referred to the characters as the new generation of CAMEL. The poster as a
potential premium item was generally well received.

Did the research confirm that the Sports Marketing creative meets the 1 + 1 = 3 objective?

-- The answer is clearly yes based on the strong, emotional involvement of the groups and
their endorsement of selected creative directions (thought process - Joe's cool, my sport is
cool, my perceptions of the cigarette are confirmed/enhanced.) ~
