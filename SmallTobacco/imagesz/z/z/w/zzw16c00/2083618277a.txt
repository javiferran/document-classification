John/Mary Ellen:
Don Bruno just requested two additional pieces from the meeting.

e The Youth Smoking Prevention Presentation and accompanying Video Commercials
« The Competitive Intelligence Guidelines Presentation for the Legal Affairs Breakout Room

Would it be possible to get these in addition to the "Brand Equity”, “Marlboro”, and "Advancement
Planning" presentations by the end of the week??

Thanks again!
