New tools are available which can help us implement thes
strategies. Learning from the current test markets, suggests that
targeted direct mail is a powerful vehicle against competitive
awareness and trial objectives. A direct program would become the
foundation of our introductory program. Recent expansion of Plans R
& C provides the opportunity to better promote and be more visible
where the ultra smokers are, supermarkets. This channel versus the
package environment would be most heavily supported.

RECOMMENDATION

Rich recommends three new test markets. I personally recommend
opening only one market against blue/white soft packs. This
proposition most clearly fits in today’s competitive situation, and
Marlboro’s ~ because it does not endorse ultra low tar as the way to
smoke. It reassures while providing the benefit of flavor through
name and product. It is “older” than Red, but not old. A one market
limits our test marketing exposure. Lastly, one market is enough
because the expansion may be more about testing a new, more targeted
marketing plan than packaging/color.

We owe you a concise plan description, with costs and a market
recommendation.

I’d like to discuss at your earliest convenience.
