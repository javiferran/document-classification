Subject: GCB speech at Kraft, late Jan
Hi Bob

Glad youin and WORKING HARD :

Like | said on the phone, Peter is out of the office & he's asked me to do a bit of
research in his absence, re: a speech he's preparing for GCB to be delivered at Kraft
later this month.

He's specifically interested in discussing how the value of investment in PM has
grown (source: maybe the last sharehoiders' report) ... CAN YOU VERIFY that the
stock price has more than tripled in the 1990s? ... AND, is there any documentation
showing how much the value of investment in PM has grown (eg: in The New York
Times this week, there was an article talking about the Dow Jones stocks, how
much certain ones are worth now based on investment in them a few years ago).

Peter will be back in on Mon but anything you can help me with today would be much
appreciated. Just email the info back // Thx!
