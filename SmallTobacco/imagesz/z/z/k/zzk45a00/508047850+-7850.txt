To: Mr. Ed Blackmer

As you know, I try not to interfere in any way with Kathy
(or any other R&D BBU representatives) as she works with the
business unit. I am going to be out of town for the next two
weeks and this note is just to encourage the support for
evaluation of Project QQ low tar product in white tipping. It
just seems like a great opportunity for CAMEL and the Company.

Your consideration will he greatly appreciated.
