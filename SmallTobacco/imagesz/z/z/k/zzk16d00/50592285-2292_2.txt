FIGURE 2 Current-voltage curve in symmetrical Cs*. Single-channe]
currents were measured as a function of voltage in symmetrical sclutions

_ of the following Cs* concentrations: (+) 18 mM, (0) 50 mM, (0) 4007

mM, (A) 600 mM. Solid curve is drawn according to the model of Fig. 5,
using the parameters of Table I; virtually identical curves are obtained
from the model of Fig. 6 and parameters of Table II, The curve here is
drawn far a Cs* concentration of 50 mM, but identical curves are
abtained over entire range of Cs* concentrations from 20 to 600 mM.

The J-¥ curves of Vig. 3 also show that this value is
independent of the absolute concentration of salt, as
expected for a single-ion channel such as this (Coronado et
al., 1980). The permeability ratio is the same regardless of
the polarity of the biionic conditions, but the shapes of the
i-V curves are different with Cs* on the cis side than with
Cs* on the trans side, as expected from the rectification of
the pure Cs* currents; posilive Cs* current is more diffi-
cult to drive through this channel than is negative Cs*
current.

Cs° Blocks K* Currents under
Mixed-Ion Conditions

Having established that Cs* does permeate the SR K+
channel, we now address the question of Cs* blocking of
K* currents. In Fig. 4 we illustrate a series of classical
blacking experiments: the addition of Cs* to one side of a
membrane separating identical K* solutions. As found
previously (Coronado and Miller, 1979; Coronado ct al.,
1980), addition of Cs* to the cis side of the bilayer reduces
K* currents. The effect is voltage dependent; block is
strong at positive voltages and is relieved as voltage is made
increasingly negative. Cs added to the trans side has a
much smailer blocking effect, although a discernable one.
Results l:ke this had previously been taken as evidence that
Cs* binds zo a site ~40% of the way through the voltage
gradient, from the cis side of the membrane (Coronado and
Miller, 1979), and we will see that in spite of the fact that
we now know that Cs* is permeant, this conclusion still
holds.

  

DisCUSSION

The major fincing of this study is that Cs*, which we had
previously considered an impermeant blocker of the SR K*
n fact a conducting ion. We would like to gain a
iwe view of the conduction by Cs* through this
channel and to consider what new light these results shed
upon the sfructural picture that has already been derived of
its conduction pathway.

    

Cs* Conduction and Block

Qualitative'y, it is a simple task to account for Cs* block of
K* currents concomitant with Cs* conduction. Whereas

on the eis side and K* on the rans (Cs/K), or with the ions reversed (K/Cs). Cation concentrations were 50 mM (A) or 300 mM (8). Solid
curves drawn as in Fig. 2. Dashed /-V curves were obtained for symmetrical K* at the appropriate concentration, and data points are omitted

for clarity.
