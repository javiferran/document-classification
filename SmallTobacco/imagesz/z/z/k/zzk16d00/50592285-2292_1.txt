Preparation of SR vesicles from rabbit skeletal muscle and of phospho-
hpids has been described, as have the methods used to insert K* channels
into the planar bilayers (Labarca et al., 1980). SR vesicles were added to
the cis side of the membrane, while the opposite trans side is defined as
zero voltage. All aqueous solutions used were composed of the SOJ salt of
the indicated cation, and alsa contained 10 mM HEPES neutralized to
pH 7.5 with the appropriate cation hydroxide. Single-channel data were
recorded on chart paper and were analyzed by hand, Each experiment
was repeated in 3-8 separate bilayers. Temperature was 21-23°C.

Only two significant variations over previous studies were used. First,
we connected the Ag/AgCl! clectrodes to the bilayer chambers with salt
bridges containing 3M KCl (rather than 0.2 M KCl); the use of lower
ionic strength salt bridges gave serious errors (5-10 mY) in the measure-
ment of reversal potentials under mixed-ion conditions, Second, in almost
all experiments involving the measurements of Cs* currents, we inserted
channels into the bilayers in the presence of symmetrical K* solutions,
and subsequently exchanged these with Cs*-containing solutions; in this
way, we could confidently identify the channel under study as the SR K*
channel.

RESULTS

Cs* is a Conducting Ion

In our previous work on ion conduction through the SR K*
channel (Coronado et al., 1980), we were unable to observe
any single-channel conductance fluctuations in the pres-
ence of symmetrical Cs* solutions. In those studies, we
used high concentrations (1-2 M) of Cs* in hopes of
enhancing any small current that might be present. We
now show in Fig. | that clear channel fluctuations may be
easily observed in symmetrical Cs* solutions at lower
concentrations, 30 to 300 mM. There are three pieces of
evidence (not shawn) telling us that the channel observed
in symmetrical Cs* is in fact the SR K* channel, First, the
voltage dependence of channel opening is similar in K* and
Cs*; channel opening is enhanced as voltage is made
increasingly positive, and the kinetics of gating are similar.
Second, the single-channel Cs* currents are inhibited by
decamethonium (150 uM) on the rans side of the channel,
as are the corresponding K* currenis, Finally, Cs* current
fluctuations as in Fig. 1 were obtained by inserting a single
SR channel in symmetrical K* and subsequently perfusing
both sides of the bilayer with Cs* solution,

Cs” is less conductive in this channel than K*; at zero]
voltage at 600 mM Cs*, the conductance is 15 pS, 16-fold!
smaller than the corresponding value for Kt. Two addi4
tional properties of the Cs* current through single chan-
nels are obvious in Fig. 1: open-channel rectification andj
concentration independence. These characteristics are doc.
umented more fully in Fig. 2, which shows the current
voltage relation (/-V curve) under conditions of symmetri-
cal Cs", at concentrations from 18 to 600 mM. The'
channel displays rectification: negative (trans-to-cis) Cs*
current passes more easily than does positive (cis-to-trans)
current. Most remarkable is the fact that the J-V curves are!
identical over an enormous range of Cs* concentrations,’
from 18 to 600 mM. Since we know (Coronado et al.,
1980) that for the other alkali metal cations the channel
saturates with ion concentration, we conclude that the Cs*4
conductance is already saturated by 18 mM. It was not
possible to collect data at Cs* concentrations lower than 15
mM, as channel opening becomes very rare under these
conditions,

Cs” is Nearly as Permeant as K*

The results above show that Cs* is much less conductive
than K* through the SR K* channel. An alternative
Measurement of ionic selectivity is the reversal potential
under biionic conditions, i.e,, the zero-current voltage, ©, 7
measured with Cs* on one side of the bilayer and K* at the |
same concentration on the other. The ratio of the two ion
permeabilities is defined by the reversal potential:

Pol Px = exp (—FY,/RT). @)
As discussed by Hille (1975a), these two measurements of j
ion selectivity, conductance and permeability, do not in 4
general agree, since they are expressions of different rate
processes in the channel permeation mechanism. Under
bionic conditions (Fig. 3), the SR K* channel shows high |
permeability to Cs*, nearly as high as to K*. The biionic
reversal potential is only 10 mV, indicating a P,/P, of 0,7.

Figure | Single SR K* channels in symmetrical Cs* solutions, Channels were inserted into planar bilayers as described in Methods, in the
presence of symmetrical K* solutions. Tmmediately after appearance of channels, both sides of the bilayer were extensively perfused with Cst
solutions at the indicated concentrations. Records were then collected at holding voltages shown. In all traces, channel opening is upward.
