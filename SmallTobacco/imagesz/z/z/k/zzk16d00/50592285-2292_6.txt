Parameters for the four-barrier model of Fig. 6, as in Table IT. Asterisks
denote parameters that may be varied up to 1 RT unit without affecting
the fits to the data. J- curves drawn according to this free energy profile
are indistinguishable from those drawn in Figs. 2, 3, and 4.

wesented in Table I] it does. The curves through all the
lata points shown in this repart can be equally well fil by
this four-barrier mode! as with the symmetric three-barrier
model. Even the nearly linear /-¥ curve for symmetrical
K*, which was the original reason for choosing a symmetri-
cal energy profile (Coronado et al., 1980), can be well fit
with the asymmetric profile here. For the same reasons as
with the simpler three-barrier model, the parameters are
rather tightly constrained by our data, especially those
issociated with the positions and energies of the wells and
peak at the selectivity filter. This is admittedly a more
complicated model than the symmetrical three-barrier
proposal, but now ihe energy profile is consistent with the
structural profile of the channel deduces from previous
work.

The same qualitative conclusions derived above for the
simpler profile still] hold. Cs* block is a result of tight
binding (Kp ~ 3 mM) at the cis-facing well, located at 0.34
electrical distance. The peak energies for Cs* and K* are
approxintely equal. We would say that the major deter-
minant of ion selectivity in this channel is a three-way
interaction of the ion with a single liganding structure ina
region 0.4-0.5 nm wide. This structure acts both as a
favorable liganding region and an unfavorable rate-
huniting selectivity filter, according to the specific position
of the ion with respect to the groups in the constriction.

CONCLUSIONS

The present results resolve the difficulty alluded to in the
introduction: the fact that Cs* blocks this channel at all.
We now know that Cs* blocks the channel by binding
tightly at a deep well asymmetrically positioned in the
permeation pathway, not by plugging up the pathway
sterically. The selectivity filter of the channel is wide
enough (0.4-0.5 nm) to allow passage of Cs*; the low
conductance of this ion is simply due to its extremely tight
binding. In the framework of our model, we can also assign
a full selectivity sequence of monovalent cation binding to
the Cs* blocking site, by combining our results here with
those previously obtained with the other group | A cations

{Coronado et al., 1980). Equilidrium binding affinity to
this site increases in the sequence: K*(1} ~ Rb*(1.2) <
Na7(1.6) < Li7(2.8) < Cst(20),

Finally, we ask why we failed to observe Cs* currents
previously. Our error was due to the fact that in past work
(Coronado el al, 1980) we employed very high Cs*
concentrations (>| M) to search for the channel. We now
know that at high Cs*, the channel remains open all the
time; no fluctuations can be observed because it simply
never closes. This behavior is intimated in the traces of Fig.
1, which show longer open times at 300 mM Cs* than at 30
mM Cs". Indeed, we could not obtain Cs* data at concen-
trations higher than 600 mM. The reason for this cffect is
not known with cervainly, but preliminary experiments
(not shown) suggest that the channel is able to close only
when it is nol cecupied by an ion. In other words, ion
occupancy holds the channel open, as has been suggested
for invertebrate acetylcholine receptors (Marchais and
Marty, 1979) and squid axon K* channels (Swenson and
Armstrong, 1982), and indeed for this channel in the
presence of ous blocking ions (Coranado and Miller,
1982). For a Cs* dissociation constant of 3 mM, the
channel would be unoccuoied only 0.3% of the time at 1 M
Cs*, and would thus have very little opportunity to close.
Single-channel Muctuations at | M K* could be seen,
however, since K* binding is 20-fold weaker than that of
Cs*.
