the Cs'/K* permeability ratio, which is an expression of
the differences only in the peak energies (Hille, 1975a;
Coronado et al., 1980), is close to unity. Thus, the Cs* peak
energies Cannot be much larger than those for K*.

The Cs* conduction pathway is clearly asymmetric, as
shown both by the sidedness of Cs* blocking action and the
“¥ curve rectification in symmetrical Cs*. These charac-
soristics imply that the cfs-facing Cs* binding site is
substantially deeper than the trans-facing site and that the
barrier for Cs* leaving this site towards the cis side is
smaller than that for leaving the site toward the trans side.
Qualitatively, then, we conclude that the Cs* conduction
profile displays a cis-facing well that is deeper than the
trans-facing well by 3-4 RT, and deeper by the same
amount than the corresponding wells for K'; the peak
energics for Cs* are about the same as for K*.

We can refine the gross features of this model by using
the free energy profiles of K* and Cs* to fit all the data
presented here. We take the rate constant, 4, over each
barrier of energy AG* to be given by:

k, = vexp (-AG#/RT). )

The six linear flux equations (three each for K* and Cs*)
may then be salved for the currents as a function of voltage,
by a method described previously (Begenisich and Caha-
lan, 1980). In the treatment here, the preexponential
factor, », is entirely arbitrary as long as it is kept the same
for both ions; we assign it a value of kKT/A (equivalent to
~10% pA), to be consistent with przvious work on this
channel (Coronado et al., 1980). We have used this
approach to model ionic conduction under symmetrical
(Fig. 2), biionic (Fig. 3), and mixed ionic (Fig. 4) condi-
tions and have adjusted parameters to achieve satisfactory
fits fo all the data (solid curves in all figures). Fig. 5
displavs our final free energy profiles, and Table [ reports
values of the parameters used in these profiles.

The remarkable conclusion of Fig. 5 is that the profiles
for both Cs* and K* are very nearly the same, except for a
single feature: the deep cis-facing well for Cs*, positioned
at an electrical distance of *).38 (Le., 38% of the way down

the voltage drop fram the cis side). The position of this well
is very tightly determined by the Cs* blocking data (Fig.
5); we cannot fit the voltage dependence of Cs* block
without assuming that this site is located between 0.34 and
0.40 electrical distance. The depth of this well almost
wholly accourts for the 15~20-fold difference in Cs* vs.
K* conductance, while the slightly higher central peak
accounts for the Cs* rectification (Fig. 2). This well depth
is not subject ic much variation, given the constraints of
our data. If it were shallower, the Cs* dissociation constant
would be too large, and we would observe /-V curves that
vary with Cs” concentration; the lack of such variation
(Fig. 2) means that the well depth must be below —5.3 RT.
However, the well cannal be deeper than --6 RT, or else
the Cs* conductance at zero voltage would be much lawer
than is actually measured.

The Cs* dissociacion constant predicted from this free
energy profile is 3.5 mM. This value is too low for us to
observe directly as a variation of Cs* conductance with
concentration, since it is very difficult to obtain channel
fluctuations at salt concentrations lower than 15 mM. But
we can estimate this value independently, assuming that
this is a sing’e-ion channel in which the peak-height
differences between K‘ and Cs* are not large. In this case,
it can be shown {Coronado et al., 1980) that:

(Kx = S4mM: y 2" = 240 pS; ve" = 15 pS; Po / Py = 0.67)

calculated value of Kc, is § mM, in good agreement with
3.5 mM eslimated from the free energy profile fits.

As with the Cs* well depth and position, most of the
parameters in lnc permeation profile are closely deter-
mined by the cata, With his three-barrier model, the
trans-facing we!l must be symmetrically positioned, i-e., at
0.6 electrical dis-ance, since the J-V curves for symmetrical
K" are nearly Encar up to 100 mV of either polarity
(Coronado et al.. 1980). Similarly, variations in the central
and cis-facing peaks for Cs* Jead to serious departures of
the calculated /-V curves from the data. Only the trans-
facing Cs* peak is not well determined by the data; it
Cannot be mace higher without compromising the -V
Curves, but it could be made lower.

 

 
  
 

    

  

 

 

 

Pore Structure and a More Realistic
Energy Profile

 

On the basis of previous work, we now have a self-
consistent picture of the permeation pathway of the SR K*
channel (reviewed by Miller et al., 1984). The entire free
energy profile is viewed as packed itito a short tunnel about
1 nm in length, as in Fig. 6. This tunnel is, for most of its
length, ~0.8 nm in diameter, but at a point 35-40% of the
way down the voltage drop, the tunnel narrows to 0.40.5
nm in width. Unfortunately, the three-barrier free energy
