ABSTRACT K_*-selective ion channels from mammalian sarcoplasmic reticulum were inserted into planar phospholipid

bilayers, and single-channel currents measured in salutions containing Cs*.

Current through this channel can be

observed in symmetrical solutions containing only Cs* salts. At zero voltage, the Cs* conductance is approximately
15-fold lower than the corresponding K* conductance. The open channel rectifies strongly in symmetrical Cs* solutions,
and the Cs* currents are independent of Cs* concentration in the range 18-600 mM. Biionic (Cs*/K*) reversal
potentials are only 10 mV, showing that Cs” is nearly as permeant as K‘, though much less conductive. Addition of Cs*
to symmetrical K* solutions reduces current through the channel ia a voltage-dependent way. The results can be
explained by a free energy profile in which the channel’s selectivity filter acts in two ways: to provide binding sites for
the conducting ions and to serve as a major rate-determining structure. According to this picture, the main difference
between high-conductance K* and low-conductance Cs* is that Cs* binds toan asymmetrically positioned site ~20-fold

more tightly than does K*.

INTRODUCTION

Virtually all K*-selective ion channels interact strongly
with Cs*. Indeed, there is no known case in which a K*
channe!—that is, an ion channel with a substantial select-
ivity for K* over Na*—is not profoundly affected by Cs*
in the millimolar range. In all cases studied, Cs* reduces
K* current through the open channel, i.¢., it blocks the
channel. The common mechanistic picture of this interac-
tion is analogous to competitive inhibition in enzyme
kinetics: the Cs* ion can enter the normal K* conduction
pathway, but cannot permeate it. Whenever a Cs* jon is
thus stuck in the open channel, K* ions are literally
blocked from permeating. K* ions must wait for the Cs*
ion to leave the channel via the same route that it had
entered before they can traverse the pore. Though many
variations in detail have been offered in the literature of
Cs* block of K* channels, such studies are usually inter-
preted in terms of these basic elements: the strong binding
and nonpermeation of the Cs* ion.

This picture is reasonable. A K*-selective site of low
field strength may easily be expected to bind Cs* more
strongly than K* (Eisenman, 1961). Since Cs* is slightly
larger than K* (0.31 vs. 0.27 nm diameter, respectively), it
is plausible to propose that simple steric hindrance
accounts for the failure of Cs* to permeate the selectivity
filter of a K* channel.

This study is concerned with Cs* block of a K*-selective

channel {rom the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a channel
whose ion conduction properties have been extensively
studied (Coronado and Miller, 1979; Coronado et al.,
1980; Miller et al.. 1984). Cs* has been shown to reduce
K* currents through this channel in a particularly simple
manner. Cs* appears to bind competitively with K* at a
single site within the channel; the affinity of Cs* for this
site varies with applied voltage as though the site is located
35% of the way down the voltage drop across the channel.
Since Cs* is cifective as a blocker from only one side of the
channel (the »:5 side), and since previous studies failed to
detect conduction by Cs*, we concluded that this blocker
ion is in fact impermeant, and therein lies its ability to
inhibit K* conduction (Coronado and Miller, 1979).

The fact that Cs blocks the SR K* channel is surpris-
ing, since it is known (Coronado and Miller, 1982) that
organic cations as large as 0.5 nm in diameter can perme-
ate; the smaller Cs* ion, then, cannot be excluded from
permeating for purely steric reasons. We now show that
our previous plug-in-the-bottle picture of Cs* block is
incorrect, that the Cs* permeability is nearly as high as
that of K*. We also show that a simple picture af Cs*
conduction through the channel can quantitatively explain
all our results on voltage-dependent inhibition of K*
currents by Cs~ as well.as on open-channel currents under
symmetrical Cs* and bionic Cs+ /K tconditions.

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In all experiments here, currents through single channels were recorded

by inserting pur SR membrane vesicles into planar hpid bilayers
composed of 90% phosphatidylethanalamine/ 10% phosphatidyicholine.
