MEMORANDUM

TO: Patrick Donoho
V.P. Tobacco Institute

FROM: John Chwat

DATE: February 21, 1997

It was a pleasure talking with you about our mutual efforts to cxiend our clients
special interests throughout the United States. And, I appreciate the opportunity to tell
you about an exciting project we developed for the National Licensed Beverage
Association (NLBA). When we spoke, I mentioned that our firm has taken the lead, on
behalf of the NLBA, to establish new NLBA state affiliates and to build their
membership. The name of this project is Campaign 2000. Because of our contacts
within the hospitality industry, we have been very successful in our efforts to establish
new state affiliates. At the beginning of Campaign 2000 (July 1, 1995), the NLBA
represented 18 states. As of the first of January ‘97, they represent 29 states. And, we
have 8 other states in various stages of the NLBA affiliation process. I'll give you a mo-
down for cach state, later in this memo.

While we have added approximately 2,000 new members to the NLBA rolls, the
pace of our membership recruitment has been less than meteoric. As you can imagine,
the membership recruitment portion of Campaign 2000 is pick-and-shovel work that
requires people and funds. Typically, our new state affiliates have a small cadre of
people, but, understandably, no start-up funds. It’s a bit of a Catch-22 situation. Despite
iny limited. budget, I try to help where I can with brochures, literature and press releases.
However, mailing lists, labels, postage, design work for state affiliate logo’s and
application forms, are often beyond the new slate affiliates financial capabilily.
Accordingly, they are only able to do a limited amount of membership recruitment.
While I expect the pace to speed-up over the next several months, J Temain concerned
that the organizing groups may not be in a position to fully exploit a recent development
that will make NLBA membership especially attractive to retailers who offer music (live
and mechanical), and/or television broadcasts.
