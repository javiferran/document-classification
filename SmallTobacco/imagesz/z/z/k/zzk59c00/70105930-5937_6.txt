as much as 8°C, while little change is ob-
served in patients with advanced peripheral
disease. Digital blood flow in normal indi-
viduals shows a marked increase, while it rises
only slightly in patients with moderate or
advanced peripheral arterial disease. In all
groups the fall in systolic pressure is greater
‘than that in diastolic pressure. From these

Fe

observations it may be concluded that SC
1950 is an effective spasmolytic agent, capa-
ble of increasing the blood flow to the periph-
ery, but beset by a number of side reactions
upon intravenous as well as rectal administra-
tion.
