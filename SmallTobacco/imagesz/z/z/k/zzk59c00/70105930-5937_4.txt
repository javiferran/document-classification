Fie. 3.

Effect of 50 mg SC 1950 intravenonsly, in 55-year-old male with arteriosclerosis obliterans
and pelyeythemia. Pain in calves upon walking 2 blocks. Hypotensive effect lasted in excess
of 55 min. Slight decline in skin temp. of toes may be due to shunting away of blood from
diseased lower extremities 10 more normal parts of body, i.2., sceond left finger, in which skin
temp. was elevated. Heart rate increased slightly, perhaps due to blocking of para-sympathetie
nervous system. Pulse vol. changed insignificantly probably on account of artcriosclerotic
obliterative discase of peripheral arteries. Vol. change following venous occiusion (relative
tee flow) only momentarily higher, then declined somewhat, due te shunting away of blood.

petipheral arterial discase the digital pulse Oscillometric readings recorded at the bra-
volume increased only insignificantly, (Fig. 3). Chium were carried out in a group of 10 in-
