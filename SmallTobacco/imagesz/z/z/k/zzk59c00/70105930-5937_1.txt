selected cases additional continuous tracings
were taken using the Sphygmotonograph(5).
Oscillometric readings were recorded by means

of the Collen’s Sphygmo-oscillometer. The
cardiac rate was calculated from the
plethysmogram. As a rule, SC 1950 was

administered through an intravenous tube
by slow injection over a period of L5 minutes
and in a dose of one-haif mg per kg of body
weight. Control determinations were made
with normal saline introduced by intravenous
drip at the rate of 10 drops per minute.
Results: Effect of SC 1950 on Blood Pres-
sure, Pulse Rate and Respiratory Rate. Blood
pressure was consistently lowered in normal
individuals as well as in patients with early
or advanced peripheral arterial disease. Among
normal individuals the blood pressure dropped
from an average of 132/80 (118/76 to
140/90) before injection to 85/63 (60/40
to 100/68) 25 minutes after instillation of
SC 1950. Consequently the pulse pressure
fell from an average of 52 mm Hg before to
22 min Hg, 25 minutes after injection. In 2
normal individuals 40 mg were administered
in 3 minutes and the blood pressure reached
its lowest level within 8 minutes; injection
extending over a period of 15 minutes, on
the other hand, resulted in a Jess pronounced
fall of pressure. The hypotensive state lasted
for a variable period of time, the average for
the entire group of 26 subjects amounting to
55 minutes. The three normal individuals,
however, shawed lowered blood pressure read-
ings for more than 150 minutes. In patients
wilh hypertension and obliterative arterial
disease the blood pressure was also lowered
by the drug. However, the response of pa-
tients of this type to comparable doses showed
considerable variations and necessitated great
care in the administration of SC 1950. For
instance, in the case of a patient with essential
benign hypertension the blood pressure fell
from 180/100 before injection to 70/60
following administration of 40 mg of the drug.
The patient became ashen gray and com-
plained of precordial pressure, but 10 minutes
after arms and legs had been elevated the
blood pressure returned to 100/70. As the

readily explained.

In normal individuals (Fig. 1) as well as
in patients with peripheral arterial disease
the Flack test gave ordinarily positive values
as long as the blood pressure was reduced,
similarly as in Hecht and Anderson’s study
on dibenamine(6); however, the Flack test
turned negative as soon as the blood pressure
once again reached a normal level. Postural
hypotension appeared generally a few minutes
after completion of injection, but became less
marked when the blood pressure began to re-
turn to normal. The pulse rate ordinarily
was accelerated folluwing intravenous injec-
tion of SC 1950. In 3 of the 5 normal indi-
viduals the pulse rate increased from an
average of 102 (80 to 134) before injection,
to 132 (92 to 148) within 10 minutes after
injection. With the return of the blood
pressure to normal, the pulse rate reverted
to its pre-injection level. In patients with
arteriosclerosis obliterdns or with essential
hypertension the pulse rate showed generally
little change following injection of the drug.
This obvious dissimilarity in the response to
SC 1950 may well have to be explained on
the basis of varying degrees of blocking of the
autonomic nervous system obtained in dif-
ferent individuals,

The respiratory rate was studied in all 26
subjects, and 9 times no significant change was
noted; in the remaining 17 cases respirations
became shallow following administration of
SC 1950, most noticeably so in conjunction
with a marked decline in blood pressure.

Effect of SC 1950 on Pulsations of Extremi-
ties and Digits. In the 5 normal individuals
the pulse volume of the digit showed a marked
increase under the influence of SC 1950. A
fair rise-in pulse volume is ordinarily encoun-
tered in patients with moderate peripheral
arterial disease, and in one typical case in that
group (Fig. 2) the pulse volume rose within
15 minutes from 0.2 cu mm/5 cc of lissue to
4.0 cu mm. Among patients with advanced
