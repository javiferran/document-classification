RE: Document Disposal Suspension Notice

As previously advised, litigation has been filed which requires us to retain
certain records, most or all of which are already subject to disposal suspension under
the Philip Morris Records Management Program. (Documents subject to disposal
suspension are identified in the Appendix entitled “Topics Subject to Disposal
Suspension” to the Records Management Manuai and in prior disposal suspension
notices). The two most recent disposal suspension notices dealt with retaining in their
original form--regardiess of the medium, including electronic mail-- documents relating
to (1) the manufacturing, testing and composition of tobacco, tobacco products. paper.

   

Philip Morris International should retain records relating to (1) and (2) above
only as they relate to tobacco products intended for sale in the United States. This
limitation does not apply, however, to records subject to the Appendix entitled “Topics
Subject to Disposal Suspension.”

This notice is a reminder that E-Mail and other electronic documents in the
categories referred to above must be retained. Although the usual retention practice
for electronic records subject to the Appendix entitled.“Topics Subject to Disposal
Suspension” has been to print and retain a paper copy, please ensure that a copy is
also retained in electronic form. Retain “on line” all E-Mail messages that fall within
the above categories. If you have any questions about how to retain E-Mail
electronically, please consult your Information Systems Department.
