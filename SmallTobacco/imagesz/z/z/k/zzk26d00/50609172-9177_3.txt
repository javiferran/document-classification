Recently, Sachs has indicated that incorrect chewing of
Dicotine gum with excessive swallowing of saliva leads to the
increased side effects of nausea and heartburn, as seen in the
present study. Proper instruction in the use of gum may well
reduce the incidence of these side effects (see Clinical Pry-
chiatry News (1989) 17(1), 47).
