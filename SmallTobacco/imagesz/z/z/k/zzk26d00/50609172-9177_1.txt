blocker, haloperidol. Therefore, the present
pre-clinical animal study was designed to deter-
mine the effects of nicotine on haloperidol cata-
lepsy in rats. Preliminary results have been
presented elsewhere [9].

Pre-clinical animal study : Methods

Subjects and experimental design

Twenty-four male Sprague — Dawley rats, 3—6 months
old, served as subjects. The animals were maintained
on ad lib food and water in a reversed 12 hr light/dark
cycle (lights on at 2100 hr).

Animals were randomly assigned to one of 4 treat-
ment groups : haloperidol plus nicotine (N= 8), halope-
rido! only (N=8) and nicotine only (N= 4). Four
animals served as a control group to measure any
non-specific hypokinetic effect produced by the injec-
tions of by repeated handling. Animals in the haloperi-
dol plus nicotine and haloperidol alone groups recei-
ved an ip. injection of haloperidol (0.3 mg/kg) and
were tested for hypokinesia al 30 min and | hr after the
injection to confirm the development of the haloperidol
effect. At this time, all animals received either an
injection of nicotine (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline vehicle
(0.1 ml/kg, i.p.).

Behavioral testing

Hypokinesia (catalepsy) was tested using the bar test
as described elsewhere (10, 14]. Briefly, the rear feet of
the animals were placed on a platform and their front
feet were placed on a horizontal bar suspended 9.0 cm
above the platform: the horizontal bar was 0.6 cm in
diameter. The degree of hypokinesia produced in the
animals was measured by how long it took for each
animal to remove itself from the bar. A maximum of
1800 sec was allowed. In order to observe the full effect
of each drug, bar tests were conducted at 30 min, and
at 1, 2, 3. 4, § and 6hr after administration of drug
and/or control vehicle.

Drugs

Haloperidol was obtained from Research Biochemi-
cals, Inc. (Wayland, MA) and dissolved in acetic acid
and saline. Nicotine was received in the free base form
from Sigma Chemical Co. (5t. Louis, MQ) and diluted
in saline.

Results and Discussion

Data were analyzed using a repeated measures
analysis of variance. The results of the analysis
showed that the duration of catalepsy for the
haloperidol plus nicotine group was significantly
different from the haloperidol only group
[FU,14) = 9.82, P<0.01]. The mean catalepsy time
for all groups is shown in Table I. These results
demonstrated that low doses of nicotine markedly
potentiated the behavioral effects of haloperido!
in animals. Nicotine alone produced no hypoki-
nesia. Taken together with other findings showing
a similar potentiation effect with other dopamine
antagonists, such as fluphenazine and reserpine
(10, 11), this suggested that nicotine may prove
beneficial in potentiating the therapeutic effect of
neuroleptics in patients with neuroleptic respon-
sive movement disorders, such as Tourette syn-
drome.

We therefore tried nicotine gum in 2 patients
with Tourette syndrome who were partially re-
fractory to haloperidol alone [15]. In this limited
clinical trial, it was found that chewing nicotine
gum, when combined with continuing haloperidol
treatment, produced a rapid, striking and marked
relief from tics and attentional symptoms in the
patients.

In this paper, we will discuss the further effects
of oral administration of nicotine (in the form of
Nicorette® gum) to 10 young patients with
Tourette's disorder treated previously with halo-
peridol.

Tourette clinical study : Methods

The cases consisted of 9 males and one female aged
between 7 through 17, with a mean age of 12 yr. The
duration of tic symptoms ranged between 2—9 yr, with
a mean duration of 4S yr. All of the patients had
attention span and concentration problems. Other
associated disorders included migraine headaches and
schoo! phobia in one case, oppositional defiant disor-
der and learning problems particularly associated with
concentration and short-term memory in 5 cases.
