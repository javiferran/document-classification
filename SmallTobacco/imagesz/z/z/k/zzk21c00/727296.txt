Excise Tax Matters
Dear Mr. Ravlin:

Thank you for the copy of your
memorandum dated August 4, 1967 which was
brought to my attention upon my return from
vacation,

Mr, William E, Duffy, our Tax
Manager, will serve as Lorillard's representa-
tive on the informal committee. I would
suggest that your Mr. Bryant contact Mr, Duffy
directly in arranging for the first meeting
of the committee, I understand that Mr. Duffy
will be attending a tax conference in Denver
later this month and that might be an appro-
priate time for the meeting.
