Jan: we've talked about the Wall St Journal's interesy in Romania. i
have spoken with the reporter. It’s a feature, it's tobacco specific
and Romania is the focal point. It’s not directly linked to

settlement, more to the eastern expansion of US tobacco companies.

T'm nervous. It's going to be very difficult to avoid talking to the
reporter, not least because she secms to be aware of the contrband
problem.

We are, to be blunt, in a war here at the moment. PMI in particluar
are incredibly upset about some things we have done on tax, and the
fact that we are killing them for market share etc.

The reporter is bound to find out about the tax....it’s plastered all
over the media, a lot of it quoting me.

My inclination is to meet, say all the good things about Romania, and
try and make the tax issue as insignificant as possible. I can do

this, so long as PMI see the big picture and realize it is in no one's
interest for this to be front page news in the US media.

But I'm warning you know, it may be difficult to control. If you or
Tom have any ideas/advice, then please pass it on.

Adam.
