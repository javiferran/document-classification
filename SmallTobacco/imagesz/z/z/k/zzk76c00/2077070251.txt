FDA Musin't Give Up
Power Over Tobacco

ue When Ta major tobacco companies volunteered to help reduce
teen smoking by supporting a ban on cigarette vending machines
and restricting advertising, it soundéd too good to be true, It was.

In retum for their conceasions, Phill ; _and the |
United States To . asked the and Drug Administra:
tion to agree not to regulate tubacco as.a drug. . no
_ That is tao high a price. The FDA must not deal away this
important regulatory authority. ~~ . . .

The FDA haa proposed limits on tobacco marketing to help ©
reduce teen smoking, and President Clinton also bas made it a
priority, However, a White House spokesman caid the deal offered
by Philip Morris.Wedneeday “falls s bit short,” even thovgh the
company is “trying to become a good corporate citizen.” . :

Some would argue that.ita motives are more proemptive than
conciliatory, however. The tobacco industry ia under pressure from
sources other than the FDA. The Justice Department is inveatigat-
ing whether tobacco executives—including those from Philip
Morria—lied to Congress and the FDA when.they denied trying to
make smoking more addictive by manipulating nicotine content.
And the industry is being bombarded by lawsuits—including those
filed by eight states—involving smoking-related illnesses.

In addition to halting cigarette sales in vending machines, Philip
Morris and United States Tebaccn prapose to ban advertising in
sports stadiums, néar schools. and playgrounds and on public
transportation. . , : : .

The government proposals go much’ further—and they should.
But in pushing them forward, the FDA shouldn't bargain away. ita
jurisdictian—even if the goal is as important as preventing young’
people from using tobacco, oo .
