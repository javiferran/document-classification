Dear Dr. Hasim:

| am submitting a grant entitled, "Novel Transcripts Involved In
Breast Tumorigenesis". This grant was previously assigned a
#4520. The new proposal represents a revised version of the
previous grant.

The two reviewers had the following comments on our previous
grant (#4520). The first reviewer was extremely enthusiastic abolit
our project. He considered the proposed methodology novel,
predicted that it would be successful, and recommended the proj√©et
for funding. The second reviewer, on the other hand, expressed ;
concerns about the P.I.'s expertise in positional cloning approaches.
Per the first reviewer's comment, indeed we have successfully used
positional cloning approaches and cloned BRCA2 gene as proposed in
our previous application. To address the second reviewer's concern
about the P.I.'s expertise in positional cloning approaches we have
enclosed our latest publication describing cloning and identification
of BRCA2 gene. Since the submission of our previous grant
application we have cloned the gene, and hence the revised proposal
has entirely different emphasis, i.e. to characterize the tumor
suppressor activity of BRCA2 gene.

We hope that the reviewers will favorably consider this revised
proposal and give the P.I. an opportunity to continue this exciting
area of research

Sincerely yours, :
ns fle
