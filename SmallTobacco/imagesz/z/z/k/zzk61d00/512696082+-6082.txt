SECONDHAND SMOKE:

HOW MUCH ARE NON-SMOKERS

EXPOSED TO?

With all the discussion today about second-
hand smoke, you may be interested in how much
you are exposed to.

The answer, in our opinion, is very little.
Expressing exposure to secondhand smoke in
terms of cigarette equivalents is one way to gain a
perspective. For example:

1} In a month, a non-smoker fiving with a
smoker would, on average, be exposed to second-
hand smoke equivalent to smoking approximately
(vs cigarettes?

2) {na month, a non-smoking waiter who
works eight hours a day, five days a week in a
restaurant would, on the average, be exposed to

_ Secondhand smoke equivalent to smoking about
2 cigarettes?

3) In a month in a modern office where smok-
ing was permitted, a non-smoker sharing an office
with a smoker would, on average, be exposed tothe
equivalent of smoking about I'4 cigaretces*

There are many ways to calculate cigarette
equivalents, and no method exactly predicts the
precise amount of secondhand smoke a non-
smoker is exposed to.

Also, cigarette equivalent calculations are-

not necessarily relevant to an assessment of the
potential risk from secondhand smoke.

In our opinion, secondhand smoke is not the
same as the smoke a smoker inhales.

‘What we are saying is that there are always two
sides to every argument. Both sides need to be heard
and evaluated in order to make an informed decision.

‘We believe that the solution to most smoking
issues can be found in accommodation. There are
ways for smokers and non-smokers to co-exist
peacefully. And we encourage discussion that will
help solve the issues without resorting to Govern-
ment intervention. Clearly common sense should
tell everyone not to expose very young children
to high levels of secondhand smoke.

As it relates to smokers, in our opinion
smoking is a risk factor for certain diseases. At
Rj.Reynolds we believe the choice to smoke
shoutd be made only by adults.
