2. The highest priority project for
WINSTON is the development of adver-

tising based on the following
strategy. *

The objective of WINSTON adver-
tising will be to convince ,
young adult male smokers that
WINSTON is the cigarette most
compatible with values, attitudes,
and life styles that predominate
among this group--without alien-
ating our current franchise.

Our copy must be true to WINSTON's
heritage as a good tasting ciga-

rette, portraying the Brand as ;
full-flavored.
