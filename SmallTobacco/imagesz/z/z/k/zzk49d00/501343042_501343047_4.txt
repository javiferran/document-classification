SENSATION TRANSFER TEST

(NOW DIRECT RESPONDENT TO CIGARETTE TASTING EXHIBIT)

These two men were walking through a cigarette factory. (POINT TO

EACH PHOTOGRAPH). They were asked to pose for cigarette ads. Before

the picture was taken, each man was asked to try these two blends of
Winston. (POINT TO EACH CONTAINER OF CIGARETTES). This man picked

the cigarette blend in this container (POINT FIRST TO MAN IN PHOTOGRAPH
AND THEN TO CONTAINER) and this man picked the cigarette blend in this
container. (POINT TO MAN IN THE OTHER PHOTOGRAPH AND THE OTHER CONTAINER)

We would like you to try each of these two cigarette blends and tell us
which one you prefer.

Please take a cigarette from this container (POINT TO THE CONTAINER).
Please light it and take about three puffs as you would ordinarily
smoke your own cigarette, and then please put it out. (POINT TO THE
CONTAINER IN FRONT OF SECOND PHOTOGRAPH). Now would you please take
about three puffs from a cigarette from this container as you would
ordinarily smoke your own cigarette, and then please put it out?
