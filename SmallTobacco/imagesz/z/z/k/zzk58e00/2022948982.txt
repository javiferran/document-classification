1993-1997 R&D Strategic Planning Committee

PHILIP MORRIS U. S. A.

INTER-OFFICE

CORRESPONDENCE

Richmond, Virginia

() be

Date: February 4, 1992

The membership of the 1993-1997 R&D Strategic Planning Committee was generated by
consultation with R&D management and management outside R&D. Those listed have been
selected to serve on this committee. I hope to contact most of you by telephone before you receive
this memorandum to discuss with you the goals and plans of the committee. If I have not been
able to do so, please accept my apologies.

A meeting of the R&D Strategic Planning Committee will be held within the next one or
two weeks to begin our important work for the coming year. I realize how difficult it is to
schedule meetings for such a large group, and the realities are that any individual cannot attend
each meeting we have during the year. However, I strongly urge you to attend the first meeting
because a number of organizational issues and goals will be discussed. Please arrange a substitute
when possible for future meetings.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
