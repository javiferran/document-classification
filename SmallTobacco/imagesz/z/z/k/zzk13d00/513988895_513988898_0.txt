Dear Dan:

This is to provide you with a brief proposal for the DORAL Everyday Low Price
Concept Test.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES

As part of its overall strategy to compete with savings brands, DORAL has been
using coupons to be competitively priced with private label brands. However,
since coupons do not always reach all target adult smokers, the brand is
considering revising its pricing strategy to an everyday price of $.30 below full-
priced brands.

The issue has been raised about the effect of this change in pricing strategy on
the image of DORAL, specifically would this everyday pricing strategy cheapen
brand image.

Research has been proposed to determine the effect of this change in pricing
Strategy on the image of DORAL. The specific objectives of the research would
be to determine the effect of dropping the price below that of full-priced brands
on:

e Interest in the brand

e Image of the brand, and

e image of the brand user.
