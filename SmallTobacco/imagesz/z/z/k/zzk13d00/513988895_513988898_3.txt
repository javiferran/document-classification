COST AND TIMING
The cost for this study is estimated to be $105,000 +/- 10%.
This cost is based upon the following assumptions:

e ~=Incidences of
- 200 DORAL smokers at 3% of smokers

- 300 competitive savings brand smokers at 14% of smokers

- 300 occasional savings brand smokers at 33% of remaining
smokers (85%)

e 20 interview with three computer cards of data and three open ends
¢ Two analytic banners
e Pre-recruitment by telephone from lists for DORAL smokers
¢ $10 co-op for DORAL smokers, $5 for other qualified smokers
This cost includes questionnaire design, data collection and processing, data
analysis and full report with graphs.

The cost if the DORAL sample were recruited via mall intercept would be
$128,500 +/- 10%.

This study would take about five to six weeks; however, we would endeavor to
meet any schedule requirements you might have.

Dan, thank you very much for giving us the opportunity to submit this proposal.

Sincerely,
