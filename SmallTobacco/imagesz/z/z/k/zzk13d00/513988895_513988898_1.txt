METHOD

A two-cell monadic concept test would be conducted.

Sample

The sample for the study would be 800 adults 21 years and older who smoke
five or more filtered, regular or 100 mm cigarettes daily. The sample would be
divided as follows:

¢ 200 DORAL smokers

¢ 300 competitive savings brand smokers
¢ 300 full-price brand smokers who occasionally smoke savings brands

In addition, within each group, quotas would be set to reflect correct proportions
by age, sex and menthol smokers.

nterviewing Techni

Personal interviews would be conducted in central location facilities. Competitive
savings brand smokers and occasional savings brand smokers would be
recruited via mall intercept. DORAL smokers would be pre-recruited by
telephone from lists provided by RJR.

One-half of qualified respondents from each target group would be exposed to
one of the two concepts. After allowing time for the concept to be read,
respondents would be interviewed regarding to their reactions to the concept.

Interviewing would be conducted in 20 geographically dispersed markets.
Quotas would be set based on high, medium and average tax levels to reflect
variations in retail prices.

The Everyday Price concept would feature DORAL with its new pack at the new
everyday low price of $.30 below full-priced brands. Prices in the concept
would be consistent with local market pricing.

The control concept would feature DORAL with its new pack and a message
that it is available in their local stores with a valuable on-pack coupon.
