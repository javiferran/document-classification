ED L/ 1 ER

OBJECTIVES/KEY ISSUES:
¢ Improve stability of menthol products.
* Improve by increasing menthol and coolness perceptions.
¢ Develop prototypes for Project SB
STATUS/NEXT STEPS:
* Aging/Variable Study-SALEM Lts, 85
Address stability of 1, 2 1/2, 4 and 6 month old products.

Assess ability of filter variables and density to retard menthol
migration.

-Wave ITI (12 weeks) Fieldwork complete
- Topline (Waves I-III) Nov. 21
-Wave IV (25 weeks) Field 11/28
* FT-SALEM King

Evaluate ability of FT technology to increase menthol and coolness
perceptions and improve shelf life of SALEM King.

- Wave II (4 month product) Results-Nov, 23
- Wave III (6 months) Field
SALEM 100
Blend and filter tow (with potential ERM implications) did not affect
acceptance. Filter tow affected menthol perceptions.
-Test aged product with different tow
-Results to R&D 11/28
SB .
Test 2 SB prototypes & Newport Box among 18-34 FFM 85 males ex
SALEM and Kool. Read 18-24's, blacks, soft pack and box smokers.

-Field 11/14
-Topline 1/5/89
