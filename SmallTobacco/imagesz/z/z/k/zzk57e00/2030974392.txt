——

Thanks for taking the time to review the _ +_-eection of the Yield Caiculation(s) effort
that we sent to you in May, 1993. Your written comments were well received and
further supported the identification of a problem with current weekly Yield

Calculation(s).

The purposes of the previous memo and providing you with our findings were to:

1. Make you aware of the calculation errors identified

2. Substantiate the identification of a problem

3. Pass the documentation and responsibility for related ‘actions/decisions on n this
issue; to the Production’ Department based on the Operations Services
Department Management Team’s opinion that this falls within your
department’s area of responsibility.

4. Express the willingness of Quality Services to support any subsequent problem-
solving efforts that may result from this information.

As stated, this effort is given to the PDMT to handle as you deem appropriate. We

appreciate your time and attention to our efforts and correspondence.
