Although the Came] Roadhouse will not be at NASCAR Events, it will be set up at some
of the biker and pool events this year. Donna is working with Sports Marketing to get a
schedule of events. We don't have the entire schedule, but we wanted to Jet you know
about the two upcoming biker events. The first biker event is scheduled the weck of
February 15th in Avondale, AZ.(suburb of Phoenix), The next is scheduled the week of
March 8th in Daytona, Fl.

We do not know the location of the roadhouse at these events. Let consumer know that
the Roadhouse schedule of operations will be posted at various locations al the event.
thanks,
