Volume Promotion Brochure - AR

This confirms our conversation on March 19, 1985, concerning
the Volume Brochure Contract (502-4). Based onthe required
procedures at the time this Volume Promotion Brochure was
routed for approvals, an AR was not required.

Therefore, it
will not be necessary to complete an AR for this project.
