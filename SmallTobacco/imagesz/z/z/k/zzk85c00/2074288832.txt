Decline in sales affects
settlement payments’

By. Mark Curriden :
Leqel Affaire Writer ef The Dallus Morcing News".

An unexpectedly sharp decline
in cigarette sales could cost the
state of Texas $200 million in the
next two years, lawyers said Thurs
day. .

Tobacco industry officials have
informed leaders of several states,
including Texas, that consumption
of cigarettes in the United Statea
has decreased 7 percent to 1D per.
cent during the past year.

The sudden steep dacline in
smoking, according to anti-smoking

“advocates, ig the result of dramatic

S0-cent price increase in cigarettes
that wes needed to help the tobacco
companies pay for the casts of set
tling historic multibillion-dollar
lawsuits with the state attorneys
general during tha past two years.

While tebacco critics trumpeted
the news of a reduction in smoking}.
the decrease in cigarette revenues
has a downside: Setudement pay-
ments to the states will also go
down. .

For Texas, which settled’ ity to

“pacco case in January 1994 for $173

bition, the decline in consumption

could mean $50 million to 678 mii. -

treasury {n the next five weeks. Lf
cigarette sales continue to decrease,
Texas would see its share of the

tobacco money drop by $260 million |

during the next toro years — money
that has already bean budgeted by
state lawmakers and Gov. George
W. Bush .

But lawyers who negotiated the
tobacco settlements say the drop in
consumption was a primary goal in
the lawsuits. :

settioments was to drive up prices

asttlament ts a tremendous develop-
ment,” said Mr. Potter, who is now
in private practice Lo Austin, ‘Ifthe
bulk of the decline {n sales is from
teenagers, then that would be the
best news.” Efforts to contact Texas
Attorney General John Cornyn and
Mr. Bush were unsuccessful Thurs
day.

A spokesman for the tobacco
companies said the industry is not
prepared to release its sales num-
berg at this time. However, lawyers
in Texas, Mississippi, Florida and
Connecticut — the statas that led
the legal fight against the industry

-—~ sald Thorsday they have been
informed by tobacco offictals that

| consumption has dropped 7 percent
to 10 pereant slace the price in-
creases went into effect.

Under the deals signed by Missls-
appl, Florida, Minnesota and Texas,
which settled their cases first, the
tobacco compenies can subtract a
fraction of thelr losses resulting
from a decline in consumption
from their payments to the states. if
sales decline 10 percents, the indus
try can decreass its payment to the
state by 9.8 percent.

However, those deductions
would be offset by penalties the in-
dustry will bave to pay if the tobac-
co companies report Increased prof-
itg during the past year. And the
industry also has to increase Its pay-
ments to the states by 3 percent @
year or the rate of inflation, which-
ever Ly higher,

“It's a very complicated formula
designed to make sure the tobacco
companies are given credit for a
reduction, in their revenues but al-
so held accountable for their ac

> tlons,” Mississipp{ Attorney Gener-
al Mike Moore said in an fnterview

; dn 1997 when these provisions of
the deal were developed. “The bot-
tom Hne is, I would rather lose ali
our state money ip return for every-
one stopping smoking,” sald Mr.
Moore.

The volume reduction clause for
Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and

Texas goes into effect starting with,

ths next payments, which come to
the states Dec. 31. Texas, which has
already received more than $1.5 bil-
Yon in payments from the tobacco

companies, is expected to receive a

The industry alto reached a mas-

aive settlement with the orher 46
states last year for $206 billion,
However, their volume-reduction
clauses are not triggered until
April. The states sued the ladustry
to recover health care expenses re-
lated to smoking. Instead of facing a
trial, the tobacco companies agreed
to an out-of-court deal that calls for
tham to pay the states about sid
Dillion a year for as long as people
condaue smoking.

Despite warnings by Mr. Moora
and other state attorneys general,
Many state legislatures and gover-
hors instituted the tobaceo pay-
ments into thelr sonual budgeys
this past year to pay for naw heal
care programs, education and bulid-
ing highways. "Fraokly, the pru-
dent thing to do is not to spelt’

they will be," Laurie Loveland: «&
