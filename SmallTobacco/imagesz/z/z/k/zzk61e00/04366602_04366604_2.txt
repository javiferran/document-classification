{or whatever moisture content MacTavish decides is eptimm).
cigarette of 20% moisture content, judging by seme specimens T
ancked in bis office, ta not at all too moist. It 1a not in fact,
I should say, as moist as cigarettes kept in a humidor. I am ask-.
ing MacTavish to send us some of these 20% cigarettes in a sealed -“
glass container so that all of us can try then. ; - Seg

Now the point of the whole thing is that I believe Yew York Univer-..
sity has made an observation, simple as it 1s, that is as important
to Old Geld as though they had suggested that we add Nra.Winslow!s
Soothing Syrup to the tobacco... . eae
I frankly don't know whether Ola Golda can be produced so they rill a “|
reach the consumer with 20% moisture, But if they can, wo can win | ;
this chenlcal analysis for throat irritants anytime, anywhere, -. :

Thies condition might de accouplised by:..

1, Simply adding a bit mora moisture at the plant and -
trusting to the prosent package to hold it. 7

2, By improvements in the packing. (This may be dimprace 7)
tical, tut, for example, by dipping the fintahed pack-' + .
‘ age, or the inner part of it, in paraffins to make it pn

stiil more moisture-tight). MeN

3, By adding a hygroscopic substances {ona which draws vt “

and retains moisture from the atmosphere) to the yd

tobacco... Kr,MecTavish is experimenting with this. , \ i

I am sending Ur.MacTavish 6 supply of cigarettes fresh from the yo at
making machines in order that he can see how mich moisture they ee

contain. But what I believe should be done next is for ur.Mitchell ~
to arrange for MrHacTaviah and I to visit the plant and learn all
we can about the practical end of the motature subject. ws
