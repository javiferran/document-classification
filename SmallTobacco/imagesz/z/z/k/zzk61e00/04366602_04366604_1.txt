2 "The moisture content of tobacco varies 4... from 8% to more than

- 60% of its weight. The average of _a score of brands (of cigarettes)
as taken from the packaga was 12%." Emil Bogen, M.D., Univ, of ° -
Cincinnati, writing in American Medical Assn, Journal, . : .

 

. . #2 Bogen reports Lucky Strike with a relatively high moisture content. :');

att The nicotine content of the tobacco filler was found by MacTavish
to be: Chesterfield 2,202, Camel 1.92%, Old Gold 1.82%, Lucky Strike
12675, Connecticut Picultural Experiment station figures (American
Medical Assn. Journal) are not exactly the same tut the order of the
cigarettes is the saame, : : .

 

T have given above only the substancas known te be irritating. The
only harmful gaseous constituent of the aacke is carbon monoxzldo, .
which produces dizziness in the young smcker, but is not irritating
to the throat. Nicotine itself 13 not an irritant, ita effeet being
toxic rather than harsh to the throat, It is generally agreed that

- the real irritants are Purwtural, the aldehydes and related substances

~ all components of the tar. Simplified, it means the less tar, the

less irritation, . .

' Now to go back to the sudject of moisture, Wy first thought was to!
, . have the four cigarettea teatad with equal moisture content. This
would doubtless improve 014 Gold's showing. And this is now being
to done. But I question whether 01d Gold will win. At best 1t could
1 hardly win by cnough margin to impress anybody. Por observe in.the
: figures above (and its about the only real discrepancy in the mois=
ture paralleliam) that Old Gold with 0.12% more moisture then Lucky :
haa roughly 0.5% more tar. . .
