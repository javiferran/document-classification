urine samples to BGTC.

The subjects will be paid for both weeks participation
when they return on April 8.

The subjects will be asked not to expose themselves to ETS
(environmental tobacco smoke) during the weeks of the test. Realizing
that this is not always possible, the subjects will be asked to keep a
diary in which they will record any exposures to ETS. They will also
record the times in which they begin and end each 24 hour urine
collection in the diary.

TESTING:

The subjects that rinse prior to sample collection will use a
premeasured volume of water (to be determined) in a graduated 50 ml
conical test tube. The subjects will rinse for 1 minute, and
expectorate the rinse back into the same tube. They will then begin
mechanical stimulation of salivation (using parafilm) as outlined in
the protocol for ETS pilot A, which consists of 3 chewing periods of 30
second duration, and 3 expectorations into a 50 ml conical centrifuge
tube. The saliva and the rinses will be analyzed for nicotine and
cotinine. The subjects that do not rinse will expectorate directly into
a 50 ml conical test tube after chewing the parafilm. However, these
subjects (as well as the rinsing subjects) will brush their teeth

immediately after eating to avoid contamination of the saliva with food
particles.

Figure 1 outlines the samples that will be taken, and the analyses
that will be performed. Saliva samples will be taken at -20, -2, 18,
42, 66, 90, 108, 120, 135, 150, 180, 270, and 360 minutes (total of 13
saliva samples). The subjects that rinse will have a rinse sample that
corresponds to each saliva sample. Urine will be collected from -24
hours to time 0; from time 0 to 6 hours; from 6 to 24 hours; from 24 to
48 hours; and from 48 to 72 hours (total of 5 urine samples). Blood
samples will be taken pre and post exposure. Table 1 summarizes
the quantity of each sample type.
