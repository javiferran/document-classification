I. SALMONELLA/MICROSOME (S/M) MUTATION ASSAY -- MAINSTREAM AND

A S/M experiment was conducted to compare 2R1l sidestream
(SS), base fraction (BF), and neutral fraction (NF) from a small
scale smoking (2) (30 cigerettes smoked one at a time) to that
of a large scale smoking (3) (120 cigerettes smoked 30 at a time).
In TA98, results obtained for the small scale smoking compared
well with data from the large scale smoking and with previous
results using these same samples. Analysis of the data indicated
that the bulk of the activity resides in the BF with minimal
activity in NF. Data from TA100 also compared favorably with
previous. data and between small and large scalie smokings. While
analysis of the TA100 data indicated no difference in $S CSC, BF
and NF activities, the NF from the large scale smoking appeared
more active than that obtained from the small scale smoking.

The collaborative study to evaluate MS and SS CSCs, BFs, and
NFs. from five cigarette types was completed. To follow up these
studies, an experiment was perfonmed to examine the relationship
of duplicate SS CsCs, BFs, and NFs from alll five cigarette codes
simultaneously. Examination of the data revealed a close agree-
ment with the previously reported data in that the BFs appeared
more active than CSCs while NFs possessed little activity. Plans
call for TA100 to be similarly tested.

Currently, a study to determine MS/SS aâ‚¬tivity of subfrac-
tions. of neutrals from model cigarettes is in progress. Duplicate
sample preparations are being tested in TA1OQ +/~ S9. The ulti-
mate subfraction being utilized is the PAH III fraction with its
associated strip. The objectives of these studies are twofold,
First, to compare MS or SS activities of subfractions isolated
from neutrals and secondly to compare these activities on a model
by model basis. To date, the activities of 2R1, S8ENF, and D3IM
models have been obtained with only RCB and RL models remaining to
be tested. :
