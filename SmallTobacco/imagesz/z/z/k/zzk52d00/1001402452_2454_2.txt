Csc and since subsequent experiments with stored CSC failed to
contain adducts, the possibility exists that stored csc, or csc
specific SD-DNA adducts are unstable. Experiments are planned to
test this possibility.

Experiments. to test the possibility of isolationg BaP-SD-DNA
adducts from normal nucleotides, in order to standardize TLC
procedures for bulky adduct separation, were performed. Using
fluorescence and radioactivity {survey meter) as detectors. indica—
tive of the binding of BaP to: DNA, no difference was detected
between samples incubated with and without metabolic activation.
The experiments. will be repeated using a scintillation counter for
increased sensitivity. Studies designed to verify the ability of
our activation system to produce BaP-SD-DNA adducts are in pro-
gress.
