Ed: trade associations that are co-sponsoring these sessions are North Carolina Association of
Convenience Stores, North Carolina Food Dealers Association, North Carolina Petroleum Marketers
Association, North Carolina Retail Merchants Association and the North Carolina Wholesalers
Association. | will ask David to invite participation by the Dept of Crime Control and Public Safety's
Div. of Alcohol Enforcement (ALE).

If you would like to send a flyer to a list of elected officials, together with a cover "fyi" advising them of
these sessions and that PM is a supporter of them, the Coalition can either send you copies to do the
mailing so you can add a personal note OR you can send the mailing list to the Coalition and they will
handle.

1 know that Gov. Hunt has been supportive of We Card training in the past and recently issued a
Proclamation in support of the sessions held earlier this year. Are there local officials we can
approach for similar support of these sessions?

Brendan: I's there a MAN consultant to help David Glenn with media outreach?
