Subject: NC We Card training

Brad,

The Coalition for Responsible Tobacco Retailing is sponsoring We Card training sessions in 5 cities
in North Carolina.

As you know, retailers welcome and appreciate this opportunity as it helps them and their employees
know and understand the minimum-age sales law, learn how to handle a minor or an abusive
customer, how to check for ID and much more.

We appreciate the FSF's past support to promote We Card and ask that we can send flyers for
TSMs and SAMs to hand out to their independent and chain accounts.

If yes, please let me know via e-mail quantity of flyers you need and addresses of where they should
be sent (include phone number) Multiple destinations are fine.
