PARTICIPATION IN LEAP MEETINGS

 

This requests your assistance in scheduling our participation
in the Region LEAP meetings. I believe that you’ve heard
about these sessions, perhaps referred to as PECOS training.
Sales has invited us, as well as Marketing Services and Trade
Marketing, to participate with them in these meetings. This
will give us an opportunity to develop better working
relationships with these people that are so critical to our
business.

The objective is to have the Brand Group and their respective
Marketing Services counterparts participate in the regional
meeting where their businesses are strongest. The schedule
of meetings are listed below:

Event For Dates Locations Hotel

West 3/30 - 4/1 Phoenix, AZ Hyatt Regency at
Region 5 Civic Plaza
Midwest 4/6-8 Phoenix, AZ Omni Adams Hotel
Region 4

Northwest 6/13 Nashville, IN Opryland Hotel
Region 1

Southwest 6/29 - 7/1 Nashville, TN Opryland Hotel
Region 2

It would make most sense to me if Virginia Slims would be at
the Southeast meeting, Parliament and Merit to be at the
Northeast meeting and Benson & Hedges to be either at the
West or Midwest (the West maybe on too-short timing). Please
confirm with Denise whether you are available for the
appropriate dates. Additionally, Arthur and Susan need to
let me know which dates they are available.
