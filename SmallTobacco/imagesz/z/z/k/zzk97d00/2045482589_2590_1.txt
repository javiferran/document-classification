We will be coordinating the scheduling with all of Brand
Management and Marketing Services personnel. One of the
objectives we have is to make this a productive session both
for how we work here in New York as well as with the field
organization. When the sales representatives shift into
breakout sessions, to "take the learning back home" as
detailed on the third day of the agenda, we’ll be using this
time to apply our newly learned skills to how we do business
in New York. If we can successfully manage our calendars,
there will be at least one Marketing V.P. at each session to
participate in the full agendas.

Please let Denise know if these dates are okay as soon as
possible. Also, Marketing Services will be getting specific
direction from Ellen Merlo, but in the meantime, you should
get this on your counterpart’s calendar.
