Subject: Tar/Nicotine Interaction ;

Using the formula derived by John Tindall, (memo attached), one can
calculate the theoretical nicotine delivery knowing only the filler nicotine
and tar delivery of a cigarette. ete

Listed below are the theoretical nicotine deliveries for the third
Tar/Nicotine Interaction Study prototypes.

N = 0.0335 x T x (F + 0.19)
where N = nicotine delivery (mg)

T = tar delivery (mg)

EF filler nicotine (%)
