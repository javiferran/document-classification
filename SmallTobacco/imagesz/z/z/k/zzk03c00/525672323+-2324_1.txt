Obviously, anyone supporting reasonable accommodation of smokers
and non-smokers will recognize the absurdity of a total prohibition
on smoking. The "neo-prohibitionists" who support this rule need
to hear from business owners and managers, interested groups, and
individuals, urging rejection of this rule or modifications in it
which will treat smokers and non-smokers with respect.

The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register April 5,
1994. An "informal" public hearing will be conducted in
Washington, July 12 ~- 26, 1994. Notices of intention to appear
must be postmarked by June 20, 1994. Testimony and evidence to be
submitted at the hearing must be postmarked by July 5, 1994. The
hearing will commence at 9:30 a. m. on July 12, 1994.

Comments must be postmarked by June 29, 1994.
