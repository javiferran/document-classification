Subject: Column Substitution for Cocoa Analysis

To: Ms. Brenda Hodge From: Ted Conner,
‘Gary Shelar and

Dave Colby

The Waters Radial-Pak C18, 10), 5 mm ID column that is currently being
used for the analysis of vanillin, ethyl vanillin, piperonal, and coumarin in
smoking tobacco, the analysis of vanillin in filter rods, and the analysis of
coumarin in cigarettes can also be used for the analysis of cocoa in tobacco
products using the same mobile phase that was used on the Whatman ODS-2 column
(60% water, 40% methanol, by volume). The analysis time is reduced to 6
minutes and eliminates the need to switch columns for these methods. The

chromatographic conditions are:

Column: RCSS 5 C18 10y

Flow Rate: 1.0 ml/min.
Mobile Phase: 60% water, 40% methanol, by volume.

Detector: Fixed wavelength, 280 nm, x 0.2 AUFS.
