Study Director: HSR
Author of Change: HSR Date Submitted: 11.Aug.2000

Subject: Concentration ranges to be assayed for the second MSC batch of the research
cigarettes in the absence of S9 (see Table 3 in the Study Plan).

Reason(s) for Change: The results of the cytotoxicity determination (Relative Survival) for
the first MSC batch of the research cigarettes assayed in the absence of S9 (exposition
date 31.Ju!.2000) showed that the lowest tested MSC concentration for all cigarette types
resulted in relative survival levels between 100 and 120 % where no increases in the
mutant frequency over the background mutant frequency are generally expected. !n order
to get a more precise determination of the mutant frequency, also the highest tested MSC
concentrations of cigarettes 268 and 269 will be slightly changed to obtain a lower
cytotocixity.

Change: The concentration ranges to be assayed for the second MSC batch of all
cigarette types in the absence of S9 will be changed (see attached Table).

Consequences of Change and Measures to be Taken: Inform team IT/MC,
Table “Treat” has to be changed
