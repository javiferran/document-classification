MEMORANDUM

April 7, 1976
TO: George Tel ford J
FROM: Larry outude A
RE: TRUE "QUIT" CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS

I have prepared the following analysis based on the Gallup and Robinson data
for True "Quit" ads tested to date, a total of 15 observations. The ads
tested ran during May, 1975 and February, 1976, and included the original |
Tip-in test of the campaign. Although this analysis covers male smokers
only, female data is also available if you find this type of report to

be useful.

This memo will:

1) Track effectiveness over time, and 2) attempt to isolate the
‘reasons for success or failure.

Listed below is a re-cap of each G & R observation of a True "Quit" ad.
Also listed are average smoker scores for all cigarette ads (including
True) run in the test issues, and average smoker scores for all Super Hi-Fi
brands (excluding True) run in the test issues.
Initial True scores were above the average for all cigarettes but fell .
below average in the third observation. The next 8 observations scored
below average, while recent ads have scored much higher. However, the True
"Quit" ads have consistently outperformed the average competitive Super Hi-Fi
ads throughout the campaign.
