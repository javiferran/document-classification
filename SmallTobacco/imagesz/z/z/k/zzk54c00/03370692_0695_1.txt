2. Because the sample size of a single observation is too small to be totally

reliable, and in order to "smooth cut" the wide variations in the above
data, the following table cumulates individual observations until a total
base of approximately 200 is reached. With this increased base, the data

C. is more reliable, and the standard errors are reduced considerably. Again,
all cigarette and all super hi-fi averages are included for comparison
purposes. .

The average True scores show consistently good performance, except for
the 7.9 average during the second group of observations. But, during this

’ same period all super hi-fi ads recorded their lowest scores, and True
again outscored all super hi-fi ads. The “Quit"sads appear to be doing very
well recently, achieving the highest score ever during the last group of
observations.
