Memorandum to the Management Committee
October 30, 1992
Page Two

Finally, staff is recommending a budget of $20,000 to cover
miscellaneous placements as requested by the Federal Relations or
State Activities divisions. This is the same level as in 1992.

"It's the Law"

Two creative executions have been developed to promote the “It's
the Law" campaign to encourage retailers to reaffirm their
commitment to observe minimum age laws (Tab 2).

The first, “Is This Sign In Your Window? We Think It Should Be,"
will be placed in national retail trade publications and in the
major publication directed at military retail outlets. IGA and

also have been added to the media schedule
to reach independent operations and "mom and pop" stores.

The "Thanks a million!" ad has been designed for placement in
state and local retail and wholesale publications as requested by
the State Activities Division.

The budget for the "It's the Law" promotion totals $78,500. The
$8,500 increase from 1992 represents the insertions added to
expand reach to include independents and military commissaries.

Budget Summary

To recap (Tab 3), the 1993 print media budget for the "Tobacco:
Helping Youth Say No" campaign totals $1,114,532, which is a
decrease of $195,468 -- or 15 percent -- from 1992 levels.

The $8,499 increase in the 1993 print budget for "It's the Law"
is a 12 percent increase over 1992 spending.

Overall, the 1993 print media recommendations for the industry's
youth program total $1,193,031, which is a decrease of $186,969 -
- or 13.6 percent -- from 1992 levels.

To meet deadlines for early-year placements, we will be seeking
on November 16 the authorization of the Management Committee to
take these recommendations to the Executive Committee for its
approval at the December 10 meeting. If you have any questions
or comments in advance of our conference call, please contact me
or Susan Stuntz.
