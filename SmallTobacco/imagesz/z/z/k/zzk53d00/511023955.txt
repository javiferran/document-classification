RJR Interoffice Memorandum

SUBJECT: LDPE Flavor Beads DATE: January 22, 1986

TO: Mr. Brad Hoss FROM: Mr. Barry Saintsing

The materials we discussed in our meeting 1/16/86 have been received.
The information on the flavor loading in the LDPE is as follows:

e Naarden - contains a 25% flavor load.

e Firmenich - contains a 50% flavor load.

e IFF - no percentage of flavor was given. They suggested
running a 5% and 10% by weight of the flavored LDPE
material.

Because all samples have different flavor loading levels, we will have

to use our best judgment for acquiring similar flavor levels on the
finished product.

If you have questions or we can be of any assistance for the Pilot
Plant run, please let me know.
