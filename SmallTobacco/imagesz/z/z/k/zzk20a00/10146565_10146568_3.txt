CORONARY BLOOD FLOW IN RATS

the validity of systemic and organ blood flow measure-
ments with this method. This adequacy is usually as-
sessed by comparing the distribution of microspheres in
symmetric organs or tissues (kidneys, brain, pieces of
muscle) (3, 7, 10, 11, 14), withdrawing blood simultane-
ously at two different locations (10), and analyzing dis-
persion of the data obtained (14), On these bases, mixing
was considered adequate by some even when the micro-
spheres were injected into the left ventricle in rabbits
(10), monkeys (3), and rats (7, 11, 14). In contrast, Buck-
berg et al. (2) showed a greater variability in dogs be-
tween results obtained from ventricular injections as
compared to atrial injections. However, as pointed out
by Warren and Ledhingham (16), identity of blood flow
to symmetric organs or to two arterial catheters distal to
the aortic root does not imply that mixing is homogenous
in the mainstream proximally.

Kaihara et al. (5) reported in the dog marked variations
in the distribution of microspheres to the heart when
these were injected in the left ventricle or in the root of
the aorta while the rest of the organs showed no such
difference between the two sites of administration. We
obtained the same results in the rat; the average values
of left- and right-renal biood flow and of right and left
brain were equal. But, although the standerd deviation
for coronary blood flow values was significantly lower
with left-atrial injections, this difference between the two
sites was in marked contrast to the lack of significant
differences in the standard deviation of flow measure-
ments in more distal beds (Table 3). Our calculations of
the results reported by Malik et al. (7) led to the sare
conclusions; despite the equality of mean right- and left-
renal blood flows, the variability in coronary flow was

Some reports (9, 11, 12, 14) have described rather small
variations in coronary blood flow with left-ventricular
injections. The discrepancies between these repdrts and
our results and those of others, however, confirm rather
than infirm our conclusions regarding the variability of
coronary blood flow measurements from left-ventricular
injections in contrast to the uniformity from left-atrial
injections. It can be inferred that the left-atrial site of
injection yields more reproducible results among differ-
ent groups of investigators. These conclusions are further
substantiated by the numerous factors that can interfere
with adequate mixing during left-ventricular injections.
Apart from the proximity of the site of injection to the
coronary tree, these include the position of the catheter
in the outflow tract or against the myocardium inducing
preferential streaming. The relatively large size of the
catheter compared with the diameter of the aortic orifice
in rats can also modify the pattern of flow stream in the
root of the aorta. Finally, it is possible that the catheter
could lie in front of a coronary ostium and then actually
decrease coronary flow; The last explanation could ac-
count for low values of coronary flow, whereas inade-
quate mixing might not alter the mean value but would
increase the dispersion of the results.
