was significantly higher (by approximately a factor of 2)
with left-ventricular injection than with atrial injection,
although the mean flow values from each approach were
not significantly different (Table 2). This finding held
true whether coronary blood flow was expressed in flow
per 100 g of tissue or in percent of cardiac output; the
same was true for coronary vascular resistance (Table 2).

In contrast with the coronary blood flow determina-
tions, no difference was found in the variability of renal
or cerebral blood: flow measurements between the two
sites of administration (Table 3). Results were similar
when those flows were expressed in flow per 100 g of
tissue or in percent of cardiac output or whether com-
parisons were made between renal or cerebral resistance.

Farther, when results obtained by left-atrial injection
were compared with those obtained by left-ventricular
injections within the same group of rats (groups A or B),
the same conclusions were found, namely a higher vari-
ability in coronary blood flow measurements from left-
ventricular injections (Table 4), contrasting with the
absence of such difference in renal or cerebral blood flow
values.

DISCUSSION

These results indicate that the left-atrial injection of
microspheres resulted in less variability of coronary

blood flow measurements than left-ventricular injection.
For other organs like the kidney or brain or for cardiac
output determinations the two sites of administration
were comparable. |

This prospective study thus confirmed the theoretical
conclusions suggested by the basic requirement of the
method as regards uniform mixing. In this comparison of
results obtained between two similar groups and within
the same group of rats, dispersion of coronary blood flow
values was higher by a factor of 2 in left-ventricular
injections. There are three possible explanations for these
findings J) a greater intrinsic variability of coronary
blood flow coincidental with left-ventricular injections;
2) differences in experimental conditions between left-
atrial and left-ventricular injections; and/or 3) an inade-
quate mixing of microspheres with left-ventricular injec-
tions.

There was no reason why biological or intrinsic varia-
bility should have been greater with left-ventricular in-
jection as both left-atrial and left-ventricular injections
were done in the same animal or in two similar groups.
Biological variability cannot be precisely measured but
one can obtain some estimate of it; in normal conditions
coronary blood flow is essentially dependent on myocar-
dial oxygen consumption as oxygen extraction is close to
its maximum (6). Accordingly some of the data variability
might be related to variation in oxygen needs; however,
there was no difference between the two groups as re-
gards mean values of heart rate or arterial pressure, two
main determinants of oxygen consumption (1). It seems
unlikely therefore that variability of oxygen consumption
might have differed between left-atrial and left-ventric-
ular injection. Similarly, differences in experimental con-
ditions are very unlikely because exactly the same pro-
tocol was followed in all animals. The probable reason
for the discrepancy in results between the two sites of
injection must lie principally in the adequacy of mixing
obtained by atrial vs. ventricular injections. Adequate
mixing of the microspheres with the blood as the particles
flow out of the heart is one of the basic requirements for
