Enclosed you will find an ingredient disclosure that has been prepared for brands sald in the U.K.

By way of background the U.K. House of Commons Health Committee requested ingredient information from PME fate last
week. They requested this information by February 28th. | am told that the other U.K. companies are prepared to respond
and will be providing some form of disclosure by this date.

The proposal is to have our list forwarded by David Davies to the U.K. Department of Health and the U.K. House of
Commons Health Committee. (Note: this disclosure is similar to the disclosure made to the U.K. Department of Health in
November of last year except for the fact that the earlier disclosure coded (and did not identify) brand names. The House
of Commons specifically requested uncoded information.)

There are also outstanding requests in Ireland and Australia. The disclosure format that would be used in Australia and in
all iikelihood treland would include a company list of flavors and a company list of non-tobacco materials.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss the approach being proposed in greater detail.
