Dear Bob:

Tanks so mich for letting ma know about the
conference on May 16th. Unfortunately, I have a meeting
with the departmental chairman that day and it would be
a bit difficult to get off. Anyway, I will see you on
the 20th and 2st.

All good wishes and many thanks.
Sincerely,

Richant J. Bing, M.D,
Professor and Chairman
Department of Medicine
