gre in vateard with those of a previous
study ‘recorded by us in which nico-
tine administration also failed to in-
fluence these various parameters in
norme- and hypercholesterolemic rab-
bits. Although several studics have
claimed that nicotine may augment
the atherosclerotic process in Chis spe-
cies??? jt is noteworthy that the daily
dose of this agent that was employed
wes equivalent to ‘approximately 175
to 525 cigarettes per day in man; car-
tainly an excessive and unreilistic
amount. Further, only a “slightly”
greater derree of atherosclerosis was
noted in one study"! whereas, others
cited subendothelial fibrosis?
rather than atheromas as the result
of nicotine adininistration. A high
dose of nicotine as well as the admin-
istration of vitamin D might account
for the pronounced medial effect on
aorta and coronary arteries noted by
another groap of investigators.”
Serum lipids that were unaffected
by CS were greatly elevated in cho-
lesterol-fed rabbits. Absolute values

to the Hpemic dict for 11 to 138 months.

were no grenter than in animals that
we have studied previously receiv-
ing the same diet for a relatively
shorter period such as three months.
The recognition of the more severe
cholesterol deposition in such sites as
the eyes and particularly the skin in
the long term lipemic animals than in
those with lipemia of shorter duration
strongly suggests that a threshold
level of serum lipids is reached after
which such material accumulates in
the tissues. This possibility has been
aliuded to by Constantinides.2*

Only one (4.6%) of 22 rabbits sub-
jected to CS developed focal bronchi-
al mucosal change characterized by
Slight atypia of mucosa! epithelium.
Such change has been observed with
apparently more frequency in human

a pulienary chanje would become
More conspicuous in rabbits subjected
to CS for longer periods remains ty be
demonstrated,

The results of the present study,
which fail to reveal any adverse ef-
fect of CS on the structural integrity
of the cardio: scular system in the
rabbit with and without induced ath-
erosclerosis, may not be applicable to
the situation in man or other species.
Nevertheless, they do provoke the
need for further investigation ecn-
cerning the purported czusal role of
CS in ASHD.
