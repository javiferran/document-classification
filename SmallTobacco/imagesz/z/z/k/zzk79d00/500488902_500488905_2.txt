Fig 3.—Schematic of aortic atheroscle-
rosis in (A) cholesterol-fed smoking and
nonsmoking rabbits; (8) non-smoking and
smoking normocholesterolemic rabbits.

teries of rabbits msintained on the
stock ration without added cholesterol
that were subjected to CS appeared
unaltered being . indistinguishable
from those of the sham CS members
of group 4 (Fig 2).

Aortic atherosclerosis was noted
only in rabbits receiving cholesterol.
Cigarette smoking had no qualitative
or quantitative macroscopical effect
on these lesions (Fig 3). Similarly, no
differences were encountered in the
histopathologic appearance or degree
of metachromasia in the atheroscle-
rotic lesions of aorta, coronary, or
other arteries in all cholesterol-fed

rabbits regardless of being subjected
to CS or not (Fig 4). No changes were
noted in these vessels of rabbits
maintained on the regular ration that
were subjected to CS. No qualitative
or quantitative difference in lipid de-
posits in the heart: or other viscera
were evident between CS and non-CS
rabbits maintained on the cholesterol
ration. Deposition of cholesterol was
pronounced in the skin and eyes in al]
cholesterol fed animals. Foci of myo-
cardial necroses were also comparable
in these groups. No increase in inci-
dence of spontaneous medial lesions
was encountered in any group.
Sections of lungs showed only rare
foci of mild dysplasis of mucosal epi-
thelial cells of major bronchi in one rab-

bit maintained on the regular ration
and subjected to CS (group J) (Fig 5).
This was accompanied by less of cilia
and absence of goblet cells. The re-
mainder of the bronchial tree in these
and all other animals exhibited nor-
mal appearing ciliated mucosal epi-
thelial cells. No alveolar alleraticns
were encountered.

Comment

The results of these studies fail to
disclose any substantial iafluence of
CS on the severity, histopathologic, or
angiographic features of aortas and
coronary arteries or serum lipids of
otherwise untreated rabbits or those
subjected to hypercholesterolemia, vis
a vis atherosclerosis. These findings
