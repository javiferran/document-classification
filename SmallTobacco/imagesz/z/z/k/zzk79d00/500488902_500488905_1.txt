exposure. Sinvke was produced by positive
pulling (blowinz) metered air through a
horizontally held cigaratte enclosed jn a
plastic Come during a timed 2-second puff.
This was followed by a 15-second hold pe-
riod, for a total exposure time of 17 sec-
onds. This was followed by a 20-second
purge paricd to sweep out the smoke and a
id-second rest period. Each daily session of
CS consisted of eight such cycles. The ap-
paratus was calibrated so that the average
 pulf volume of smoke produced was 35 ml.

The smoke was pushed into a constant
volurae (254 ml} smoke exposure chamber,
Uniform mixing was achieved with a me-
chanical mixer attached to one cf the ani-
mal cone holder plates. Smoke dilutions of
approximately L:11 were achieved with one
ciyarette belag smoked. The animals were
het in cylindrical holders and breathed
the exposure chamber contents with their
noses just inside tha smoke chamber.

The cigarettes employed were reference
research cigarettes (1R1) (obtained from
the Tobacco and Health Research Insti-
tute, University of Kentucky, Lexington,
Ky). The smoke analysis of nicotine for
this reference cigarette with a 23 mm butt
Jength as utilized in these studies is 2.63
ing. All cigarettes were equilibrated to a
0% relative humidity atmosphere by plac-
ing them unwrapped into a desiccator con-
taising 75% W/W glycerol-water solution.

Biochemical reactions were performed
On 2ortic blood obtained at time of death
after an overnivht fast. Total lipids, tri-
glycerides, total cholesterol, phospholipids
and a- and B-lipoproteins were determined
as doseribed previously.»

Coronary angiography was performed
by catheterization of the left femoral ar-
tery. The catheter was positioned either
selectively in the left coronary orifice or at
the root of the aorta at the Jevel of the cor-
Onary cusps by television Ruoroscopy. In-
Jestions of diatcizoate tneglumine (Reno-
grafin 76) were delivered by manually
controled flow. At Inast three animals in
each group had successful coronary angio-
Erems performed prior to death,

eructerosis wus determined erbitearily by

Blocks of lungs, heart, aorta, intestine,
pancreas, splcen, kidneys, gonads, and th vo
roid were fixed in 4% formaldehyde solu-
tion. One to three blocks of the left and
night coronary arteries were obtained
within .2 cm of the coronary orifices. Par-
affin sections were prepared in the usual
manner and stained with hematoxylin-eo-
sin. In addition, sections of coronary ar-
teries, heart and aorta were stained with
thionine at pH 4, 1:10,000 for estimation of
metachromasia and the orcein  elastica
method. At least 12 sections of lung from
each animal were stained also by the PAS
reaction. The statistical sipnifcance of dif-
ferences between groups was estimated by
the Student é-test..

to smoking. Although most angiograms in
this group of rebbits were comparable to
those in Fig 1, coronaries in this animal
were indistinguishable from those of nor-
mocholesterciamic rabbits with and with-
out smoking. This animal exhibits large

Results

All animals exhibited modest
weight gain during the experimental
period (Table).

Total serum lipids, cholesterol, tri-
glycerides, and lipoproteins were sig-
nificantly (P<.01) but comparably el-
evated in animals of all groups
receiving the cholestero) dict (Table).

Coronary angiography disclosed foci
of atherosclerotic beading and nar-
rowing of one or more coronary ar-
teries only in cholesterol-fed rabbits
(Fig 1). The degree of change was
unaffected by CS and the coronary ar-
