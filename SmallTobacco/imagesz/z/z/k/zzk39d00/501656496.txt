P. R. J. Burch
Smoking andâ€™ Lung Cancer: the Problem of Inferring Cause
Jour. Royal Statistical Soc. A 141 (Pt. 4) 437-477 (1978)

 

Stating that the dogma that lung cancer is almost entirely due to
cigarette smoking rests largely and necessarily on epidemiological
studies, Professor Burch reviews the many methodological problems
arising in epidemiology; such as the impossibility of randomizing
for smoking, constitutional differences between smokers and nonsmokers,
the heterogeneity of the human population, clinical diagnostic error
changes, and the frequency association is identified with cause. Also,
there is no comprehensive theory of carcinogenesis that as yet commands
general acceptance. He then describes the association between smoking
and lung cancer and their connection with sex and country. Secular
trends in recorded mortality from lung cancer in England and Wales,

1901 to 1970, are derived from the Registrar General's statistics.

Estimates are made of the expected trends assuming that the assoctations
found between the various types of smoking and lung cancer reflect causation.
Observed and expected trends conflict. The secular trends in mortality

from lung cancer in British male doctors are also examined. He argues

that no definitive conclusions can be reached about the extent of any

causal link between smoking and lung cancer. It is very doubtful that

the entire association observed between smoking and lung cancer in
occidental males should be interpreted in causal terms.
