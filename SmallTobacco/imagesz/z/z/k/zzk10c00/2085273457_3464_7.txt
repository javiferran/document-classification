SMOKING is to be banned in Manchester's Arndale Centre - with the overwhelming backing
of shoppers. The complex, which is the biggest city centre shopping mall in Europe, will
Officially become smoke-free on March 13, which is National No Smoking Day.

Smoking is already banned in nearly all shops within the centre, but now the Arndale itself will

become no-smoking like the rival Trafford Centre. {Manchester Evening News) Link

STUDIES
[Sup] Habits: Smokers! Ethnicity May Make Difference

When it comes to the health effects of smoking, the ethnicity of smokers may be as important
as the kind of cigarettes they smoke.

A new study has found that Chinese- American smokers take in less nicotine per cigarette
than white smokers do and that their bodies actually metabolize the drug more slowly.

This may mean that Chinese-Americans generally need fewer cigarettes to maintain their
nicotine levels. The finding may also help explain why lung cancer rates are lower among
Asians, the authors said. (New York Times) Link
