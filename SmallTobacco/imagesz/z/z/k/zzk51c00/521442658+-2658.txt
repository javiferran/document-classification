Dear Mr. Egressy,
Please clarify the relationship, if any, between the following: /
Olsanske Designation Hungary Designation German Designation

Cigarette paper Panderma 18 Grade A H25/0.50P/STP/TCF?
Cigarette paper Panderma 25 Grade B : H25/0.50P/STP/TCF?
Plugwrap R27 PW 27 or PW/NP/27mm PW/NP/28

We think that some of these may be the same, but the information that was sent to us from your factory is not
always consistent as far as nomenclature or supplier name (for example, Olpa vs Olsanske).

Piease supply a supplier reference number for the Tann tipping used on Kossuth Filter. The size Is not enough
information. .

We also still need a sample of the triacetin that you use from Akzo Chemical.

We have a November 1 deadline so ¢ hope to hear from you soon.

Best regards,
Carolyn Rahn
