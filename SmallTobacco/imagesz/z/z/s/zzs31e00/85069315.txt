MEMORANDUM
January 23, 1975
TO: Mr. Gordon Flinn
FROM: Sara Ridgway
RE: OGF Portfolio Research

As we discussed, the requested OGF Portfolio Research study to
determine the executional direction for the new OGF creative
campaign may be one of the singularly most important things we
do this year. Further, time is of the essence, and we must
field this test the week of February 10th. Creative elements
from CBA will be available not later than Thursday, February 6th.

Because OLD GOLD has spent $33,976 of our $39,000 budget, and
the study will cost $8,700, we would like to transfer the
needed $3,676 from the NEWPORT research budget. I have dis-
cussed this with Mr. Toti and we have agreed that jf he should
need these funds for NEWPOkT research prior to the end of the
current budget period (August 3lst), we will cancel advertising
to reimburse him.
