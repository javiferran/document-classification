October, 1983

Cells should be exposed to the test chemical during
at least two time intervals, e.g. Gg and S.
Exposure during the G, phase of the cell cycle
should be accomplished by adding the test substance
prior to addition of mitogen. Exposure during or
after the first S phase may be accomplished by
exposing cells 24-30 hrs after mitss, under â€œsafe*
(e.g. darkroom) lights, or in din light from
incandescent lamps to minimize photolysis of BrdU
containing DNA. At the end of the BrdU incubation
period, cells should be fixed and stained for SCE
determination. Cultures should be treated with a
sOindle inhibitor (e.g. colchicine or Colcemid ) 2
hr prior to harvesting.

duman lymphocyte cultures

l.

For preparation of human lymphocyte cell cultures,
heparinized or acid-citrate-dextrose treated whole
olood should be added to culture medium containing
a mitogen, e.g., phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and
incubated at 37 C. White cells sedimented by .
gravity (buffy coat) or lymphocytes which have been
purified on a density gradient such as Ficoll-
Hypaque may also te utilized.

Cells should be exposed to the test chemical during
at least two time intervals, e.g. Gy and S.
Exposure during the Gq phase of the cell cycle
should be accomplished by adding the test substance
prior to addition of mitogen. Exposure during or
after the first S phase may be accomplished by
exposing cells 24-30 hrs after mitogen stimulation.
After exposure, cells should be washed and then
cultured in the absence of the chemical.

Culture harvest time

A single harvest time, one that yields an optimal
percentage of second division metaphases, is
recommended. If there is reason to suspect that this is
not a representative sampling time (which may occur for
short-lived, cycle specific chemicals), then additional
harvest times should be selected.
