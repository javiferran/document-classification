be altered in the presence of metabolic activation
systems. Cytotoxicity may be evidenced by a large
(e.g. 75%) decrease in the number of cells that
have divided twice in the presence of Brdu.
Relatively insoluble substances should oe tested up
to the limit of solubility. For freely soluble
nontoxic chemicals, the upper test chemical
concentration should be determined on a case by
ease basis. When aporopriate, a positive response
snould be confirmed by using a narrow range of test
concentrations.

TESST PERFORMANCE

A. established cell lines and straias
i. prior to use in tne assay, cells should be
generated from stock cultures, seeded in culture
vessels at tne appropriate density and incubated at

37. C¢.

2. Cell lines and strains should be treated with test
chemical both with and without metavolic activation
when they are in the exponential stage of growth.
At the end of the exposure period, celis should. be
washed and incubated for two replication cycles in
medium containing Brau. after BrdU is added, the
cultures should be handled in darkness, under
“safe” (e.g. darkroom) lights, oF in dim light from
incandescent lamps to minimize photolysis of BrdU
containing DNA. At the end of the BrdU incubation
period, cells should be fixed and stained for SCE
determination. Cultures should be treated with a
spindle inhibitor: (e.9- colchicine or Colcemid ) 2
hr prior to harvesting.

B. Human iymphocyte cultures

1. For preparation of human lymphocyte cel] cultures,
heparinized or acid-citrate-dextroseé treated whole
plood should be added to culture medium containing
a mitogen, €-g-. phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and
incubated at 37 C. White cells sedimented by
gravity (buffy coat) or lymphocytes which have been
purified on a density gradient such as Ficoll-
Hypaque may also be utilized.
