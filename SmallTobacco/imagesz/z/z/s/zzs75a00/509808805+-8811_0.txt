4yG-Chromo-Sister Chrom-In Vitro
Setooer, 1983

PYRPOSE

 

The sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assay detects the ability
of a chemical to enhance the exchange of DNA between two
sister chromatids of a duplicating chromosome. The test may
pe performed in vitro, using, for example, rodent or human
â€˜cells, or in vivo using mammals, for example, rodents such as
mice, rats and hamsters.

 

Il. DEFINITION

Sister chromatid exchanges represent reciprocal interchanges
2f the two chromatid arms within a single chromosome. These
exchanges are visualized during the metaphase portion of the
cell cycle and presumably require enzymatic incision,
translocation and ligation of at least cvo DNA helices.

IIL. REFSRENCE SUBSTANCES
Not applicable.

IV. TEST METHCD
Ae Principle

Following exposure of cell cultures to test chemicals,
they are allowed to replicate in the presence of
promodeoxyuridine (3rdU), followed by treatment with
colchicine or colcemid to arrest cells in a metaphase-
like stage of mitosis (c-metaphase). Cells are then
narvested and chromosome preparations made.
Preparations are stained and metaphase cells analyzed
for SCEs. :

B. Description

In vitro SCE assays may employ monolayer or suspension
cultures of established cell lines, cell strains or
primary cell cultures. Cell cultures are exposed to
test chemical and are allowed to replicate in the
presence of BrdU. Prior to harvest, cells are treated
ad with a spindle inhibitor (e.g. Colchicine or Colcemid *)
to accumulate cells in c-metaphase. Chromosome
preparations from cells are made, stained and analyzed

for SCEs.
