Statistical Processing of H.T.I. Test Data

As we discussed over the phone, this memo requests that your Department
develop the capability to routinely perform various computer statistical

analyses of H.T.I. product test data tapes for the Market Research
Department.

We are all pleased about the progress your group has made along with

that of Tom Budne in the development of improved and more sophisticated
statistical analyses of product test data. Now that this work is being
done on a routine basis for P.0.L. tests, it seems worthwhile expanding
this system to cover H.T.I. There are several advantages jin Richmond's
performing the same statistical analyses on H.T.I. and P.O.L. data.

The first is greater comparability in evaluating product tests results.
Another is that any improvements your Department, Tom Budne or the Market
Research Department make in these analyses can be shared. Finally, the
proprietary nature of such statistical analyses will be preserved.

Let me know at your earliest convenience how best we can implement such
a program.

Thank you for your cooperation.
