Quite a few people I’ve spoken with over the course of the last few weeks are hoping to
have their businesses cover all or a portion of their cost... And, in that regard I would have
liked to have been able to include in this letter a detailed itinerary of the planned workshops,
issues forums, and braintrusts. That information, however, is not yet available, and I don't
know when it will be. So to assist you in your planning I am enclosing a copy of last year’s
itinerary, which I suspect, will look a lot like uhis year'y, As soon as this year’s list of issue
forums and braintrust becomes available I will send it to you pronto!

One last thing. You can still make reservations at the Renaissance Hotel through July
26. Remember to tell them that you art reserving a room under the block reserved for Carrie
Meek. Several people have expressed concern, and fightfully so, that they have been given the
number to the D.C. Housing Bureau. If you've been routed to the D.C. Housing Bureau, let
me know and I'll work to ensure that your reservation is included in the Meek group. The
number to the Renaissance Hotel is 202 398 9000.

Sincerely,
