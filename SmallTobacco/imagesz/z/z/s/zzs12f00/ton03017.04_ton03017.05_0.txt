Dear Friend of Carrie Meek:

Plans are continuing to shape up for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s 23rd
Annual Legislative Weekend, September 15-19, at the Washington (D.C.) Convention Center.
For your consideration I've enclosed a preliminary schedule of events and associated costs.
There is not a registration fee for the CBC weekend Issue Forums and Braintrusts, however,
registration is required.

Issue Forums are scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday at the Washington Convention
Center. The Braintrusts will be held on Friday in committee rooms on Capito) Hill.

Fashion show, two shows, Friday, 8 p.m., and Saturday {2 noon. This year’s theme:
A Return to OZ. After Friday’s fashion show there will be a benefit concert featuring either
Chaka Kahn or Gladys Knight.

The keynote speaker fur Saturday aight’s awards dinner has yet to be decided. Bernard
Shaw of CNN will serve as the Master of Ceremonies and entertainment will be provided by
the O'Jays and Levert.

I realize that attending the CBC weekend is quite an expensive proposition considering
airfare and housing costs. However, I would like to encourage as many of you who can afford
to attend to do so. The Braintrust and the Issues Forums are usually very thought provoking.
The social events are usually very nice, but trying to attend all of them could cost you an arm
and a leg. So use your own judgement.

On Friday cvcning Congresswoman Meek will host a complimentary reception on the
roof top terrace of the Madison Building of the Library of Congress for her friends from Miami.
