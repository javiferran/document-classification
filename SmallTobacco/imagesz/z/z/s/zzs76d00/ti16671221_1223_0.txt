To Whom it May Concern

| am writing in response to your proposal to regulate the sale. distribution,
advertising, and promotion of tobacco products | have no quarret with your goal of
preventing underage use of tobacco praducts My concern. however. is the laws of this
nation be made by the elected representatives o7 the people in Congress. and not by

un-elected bureaucrats accountable only to thernselves

For nearly 90 years, and on at least twenty different occasions Congress has
specifically rejected proposed legislation to grart FDA jurisdiction over tobacco,
including seven occasions in the last few years For the record, here ts an account of

Congressional activity on the issue of FDA jurisdiction over tobacco:

* 1929 -- S. 1468 (71st Cong.. ist Sess) was introduced by Sen. Smoot to bring
tobacco products within the jurisdiction of the Federal agency enforcing the
nation’s drug laws. The bill did not pass

. 1956 - H.R. 11280 (84th Cong., 2d Sess } was introduced to amend the Food.
Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA)} to grant “DA regulatory authority over cigarettes.
The bill did not pass
