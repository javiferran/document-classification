. 1992 -- H.R. 4350 and S. 2298 (102nd Cong. 2d Sess.) were introduced to
expand FDA jurisdiction by creating a new regulatory category for tobacco
products. Neither bill passed. At the time. Rep. Michael Synar stated that “the

FDA. . . is powerless to do anything about tobacco" (138 Cong, Rec
E£483-02)

. 1993 --H.R. 2147 and S. 672 (103rd Cong.. *st Sess.) were introduced ta

expand FDA jurisdiction by creating a new regulatory category for tobacco
products. Neither bill passed

Despite this jong history of congressionai action. the FDA. in its proposal, has
decided to grab for itself jurisdictior. which the Congress has retained or granted to
others, but in no case, granted to the FDA. As | stated earlier. | agree with your goal of
preventing underage tobacco use. But, that is nct the issue. Rather the issue ts who
makes the law in this country -- the elected representatives of the American people, or

unelected bureaucrats at the FDA. The rule must be withdrawn

Sincerely.
