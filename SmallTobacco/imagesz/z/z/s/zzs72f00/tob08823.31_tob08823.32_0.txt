DRAFT ~ TARGETING MINORITIES

Some pretty heavy hitters have tried to stamp out
smoking: Roman popes, Russian czars, Turkish sultans
and English kings. They all failed. Tobacco's
popularity with the people has always triumphed over the
pressure of the potentates. ° |

Currently, the tobacco antagonists are directing
their fire on the alleged "power" of cigarette
advertising to "cause" smoking among minorities. They
point to billboards in certain neighborhoods and ads in
minority newspapers and magazines as evidence that
cigarette, companies are "targeting" these groups.

If by "targeting" they mean trying to get a
specific group of smokers to switch from Brand X to
Brand A, there's nothing immoral, unethical or illegal
about it. Wooing and winning over your competitor's
customers to your brand is the name of the game in the
American free market economy ... whether you're selling
automobiles, track shoes, tooth paste or tobacco.

Advertising doesn't cause people to drive, jog,
brush their teeth -- or smoke cigarettes.

Take the Soviet Union, for example. Cigarette
advertising has never been allowed. ‘Yet millions of
Russians smoke.

In many countries that have banned or sharply

curtailed cigarette advertising, more adults smoke than

ever before. oe .
