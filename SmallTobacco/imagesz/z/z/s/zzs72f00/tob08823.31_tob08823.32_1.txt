Quite obviously advertising doesn't cause people to
start smoking. Advertising promotes one brand versus |
another. Advertising offers them freedom of choice.

And’ just as obviously advertising bans don't cause
people to stop smoking. But bans will limit their
freedom of choice.

The National Newspaper Publishers Association, an
organization representing many of the country’s more
than 400 black newspapers, said that smoking issues
should be addressed through “increased education and not
by the elimination of advertising in newspapers and
other publications."

It's patronizing to imply that minorities are more
vulnerable to tobacco advertising and need special
protection through censorship.

So the real question may be why anti-tobacco groups

are targeting minorities.
