RESULTS
Analytical data, sorted by level, are reported in table 4.

In order to identify potentiai outliers, the. results corresponding fa
each MH level were reported on dot plots (Figs 1-5).

Four extreme values, Af, C2, C3 and D2, were observed in PME results.
They could not be accounted by any technical reason. AG and D2 were
statistically identified as outliers, and therefore omitted in
calculations. C2 and C3 could not be rejected.

The mean values and standard deviations for each jaboratory and level
are reported in tables 1 and 2.

Table lL : Average MH-30 values (ppm) of five laboratories at five
residue levels in = 9) ~,

 

Table 2: Standard deviation of MH-30 figures of five laboratories
at five residue levels (n = 6)

 

The comparison of HPLC figures does not show any significant mean

difference betwaen the Tour laboratories at levels B,C,D,#.
Differences observed at level A are significant, but they are mainly
due to the small standard deviation at this level. If only absolute
figures are considered, PM-USA-2 and ULT values tend toe be about 10
pm lower than PM-USA-1 and PME values.
