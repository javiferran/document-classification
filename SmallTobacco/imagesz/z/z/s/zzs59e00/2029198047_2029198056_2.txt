Although no statistically siqnificant maximum standard deviation is
observed for a given level, the comparison of absolute figures {table
2) shows that repeatability achieved in PM-USA-1 and PM-USA-2Z
laboratories is better as compared to PMP and ULT.

The comparison of mean HPLG values (pooled Jaboratories}) with average
Iso results is reported in table 3: The mean HPLC figures are clearly
significantly lower than the values obtained by the reference I50
method. As shown in fig.6, the mean difference "ISO - average of 4

HPLC laboratories" is dependent on the MH level.

CONCLUSION

The HPLC method demonstrated a good repreducibility between the four
laboratories. However, two problems Were revealed which need to be

addressed.

i. Lower repeatability observed in PME and UT labs as compared to
PM-USA'S.

di. Significant differences between EPLC and ISO values.

The latter issue is particularly impostant with respect to the legal
context prevailing in some Burcpean countries, i.e., Germany, Italy
and Spain, where a MH maximum residue limit has been sat.
