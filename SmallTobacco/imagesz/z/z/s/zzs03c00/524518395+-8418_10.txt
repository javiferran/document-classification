[DIMETHOMORPH] Chronic Oral Study (83-1)

‘Results - The specific gravities of all urines collected at the end of the Study were > 1.010
indicating they were sufficiently concentrated for proper chemical and microscopic analysis. All
urine chemical and microscopic parameters measured were within normal limits and no effects
attributable to Dimethomorph treatment were found. Fecal occult blood studies were negative

. for all animals in all treatment groups. : :

7: Sacrifice and pathology

All dogs were sacrificed on schedule and were subjected to gross pathological examina-
tion, The Checked (X) tissues were collected for histological examination and the double
checked (XX) organs, in addition, were weighed.

Results -

a. Organ weight ~ The absolute liver weight of high dose male dogs and the calculated
covariant liver weight of high dose male and female dogs was Statistically increased
(Table 5), Relative liver weights were increased by 28% in males and 41% in
females at 1350 ppm. The study authors also reported that the absolute prostate
weight of high-dose male dogs was significantly decreased (by almost 50%) and the
covariant testicular weights of mid- and high-dose dogs were Significantly increased.
According to the study authors, the increased testicular weights were of doubtful
biological significance. The mean uterine and ovarian weights of female dogs treated
with 1350 ppm dimethomorph were greater than contro! dogs, however, considerable
variability within the treatment group was present, ‘
