_ [DIMETHOMORPH] | Chronic Oral Study (83-1)

Dose Selection Study in Dogs

MRID: 421153-06

Study Type: Supplemental to 83-1
Test Material: Dimethomorph
Study No.: 635228

Testing Facility: Inveresk Research International, Musselburgh, Scotland
Study Title: Dietary Maximum Tolerated Dose Study in Dogs

Authors: R.J. Greenough and R. Goburdun
Study Completed: July 1986 os

Test Animals: Male and female beagle dogs

Age/Weight: 4-5 months at receipt/9.8-14.0kg

Group Size: Part A: I male, 1 female; Part B: 1 male, 1 female

Test Concentrations:Part A: The dogs were fed diets on consecutive weeks containing 1000,
750, 900, and 1200 ppm Dimethomorph; Part B: The dogs were fed diets containing
1200 ppm Dimethomorph for 2 weeks

Results

Clinical Signs: Part A: When dogs were fed 1000 ppm Dimethomorph for one week, minor
clinical signs of toxicity were noted in the male dog were noted (emesis, subdued
behavior, and increased micturition). The female dog produced no signs of clinical
toxicity when fed 1000 ppm test material. Treatment with the test material did not induce
clinical signs of toxicity when fed at concentrations of 750, 950, or 1200 ppm
Dimethomorph.

Part B: Slight body tremors were noted in the male dog. .

Mortality: No mortality was induced in Part A or Part B of the study.

Body Weight: Part A: The male dog lost 8% of his body weight during the first week of.
treatment (1000 ppm Dimethomorph). After the first week of treatment, the male dog
gained weight slightly so that the overall decrease in body weight at the end of the four
week study was 4%. The female gained 0.1 kg during the four week study.

Part B: The body weights of the male and female dog were unaffected by treatment.

Clinical Pathology: Part A: No blood or urine treatment-related effects were found. All
measured parameters were within normal
Part B: No blood or urine treatment-related effects were found. â€˜All measured
parameters were within normal .

Gross Pathology:Part A: No treatment-related gross lesions were observed; Part B: No
treatment-related gross lesions were observed.

Conclusions: The maximum tolerated dose of Dimethomorph given to dogs in the diet is
> 1200 ppm.
