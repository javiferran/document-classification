"Time-weighted average hased on food consumption and body weight.

 

| Dose selection rationale: The HDT was considered by the study authors to approximate
, the emetic threshold of Dimethomorph as determined in beagle dogs in IRI Study 635228
[MRID 421153-06 (Appendix B)] .

2. Diet preparati i

Test diets were prepared weekly by mixing. appropriate amounts of powdered Dimetho-
morph with ground SDS Dog Diet A (Special Diet Services Limited, Stepfield, England)
for 20 minutes in a Winkworth Change Drum Mixer. Three 50 g samples of the freshly
prepared diet from all treatment groups taken at study weeks 1, 4, 9, 22, 35, and 49
were analyzed for test material concentration. Representative 100 g samples were taken
from each freshly-mixed diet for archival purposes. The study report stated the
homogeneity and stability of Dimethomorph were previously established in a dog 13-
week dietary toxicity study of the test material (IRI Project No. 335044), The analytical
results derived for IRI Project No. 335044 were reported separately under IRI Project
No. 335065.
