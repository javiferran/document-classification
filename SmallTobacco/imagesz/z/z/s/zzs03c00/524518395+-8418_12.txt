[DIMETHOMORPH] _ - : Chronic Oral Study (83-1)

b. Gross pathology - No visible lesions as a result of treatment with Dimethomorph
were found.

c. Microscopic pathology

-1) Non-neoplastic ~ According to the study authors, the only significant change
associated with dimethomorph treatment was a slight qualitative increase in
hepatic lipid as determined by Oil red O stain (Table 6), A review of the
histopathology data shows that all male and female dogs in all treatment groups
developed some degree of hepatic and renal lipid accumulation, however, no
other explanation for the increase in liver weight was provided. The distinction

. between the qualitative classification categories used was not included in the
study report.

The authors also reported an apparent increase in the severity of prostatic
interstitial fibrosis of treated dogs. However, they also stated that the degree of
infiltration was not pathological and that the effect could have resulted from
slightly different levels of sectioning. No other histopathological evidence was
presented to explain the decrease in prostatic weight or the increase in testicular
weight of male dogs, The individually increased uterine weights of certain dogs

correlate with increased ovarian weights and histopathology that is suggestive of
estrus. .
