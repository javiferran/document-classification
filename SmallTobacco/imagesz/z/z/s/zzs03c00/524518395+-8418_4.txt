{DIMETHOMORPH] Chronic Oral Study (83-1)

Results ~ Clinical signs included changes in fecal consistency, isolated incidences of â€”
emesis, and estrus activity. These observations were found in all groups, including the
control animals, and were regarded as background findings. One male dog in the 1350
ppm group had five convulsive seizures between weeks 44 and 47 of the study. Three
seizures occurred in one day and were followed by food regurgitation and subdued
behavior. The following day the dog had a fourth seizure.and had subdued behavior for
the next two days.. Three weeks later, the fifth seizure occurred. Following the seizure,
salivation, ataxia and subdued behavior were observed for the next two days. One
female dog in the 150 ppm group had two stress-related seizures prior to weighing during
study weeks 32 and 34. Because the incidence of spontaneous convulsions in untreated
beagle dogs may range up to 12%, the convulsions were considered unrelated to
Dimethomorph treatment. Individual animal data for clinical signs of toxicity were not
included in the study report.

2, Body weight

The dogs were weighed weekly commencing two weeks before the start of the Study and
for its 52-week duration.

Results - No treatment-related or dose-dependent effects on body weight were observed
in any of the exposure groups. With the exception of female dogs fed 150 ppm
Dimethomorph, no statistically significant effects on body weight gain were found.
Shown in Table 2 are group mean body weights and percent deviation from contro! at
selected weeks during the study.
