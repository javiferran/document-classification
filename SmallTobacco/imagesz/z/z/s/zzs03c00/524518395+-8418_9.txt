[DIMETHOMORPH] Chronic Oral Study (83-1)

of the increased ALK activity in high dose dogs is uncertain, particularly since other
clinical chemistry indicators commonly used as a measure of liver or bone homeostasis
(total bilirubin, AST, ALT, LDH, TSP and albumin) were not affected by dimethomorph
treatment. With the exception of a slight increase in the qualitative estimate of
intracellular hepatic lipid accumulation (Table 6), no corroborative hepatic histopathology
was reported.

6. Urinalysis and fecal occult blood

Urine was collected from fasted animals over the final 17 hours of a 21-hour water
deprivation period while the dogs were housed in metabolism cages at pretrial and weeks
13, 26, and 51 of the study. Stool samples were collected during the time of urine
collection for occult blood analysis.
