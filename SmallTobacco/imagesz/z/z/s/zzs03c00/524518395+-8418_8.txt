Results ~ No biologically significant treatment-related variations in any of the examined
parameters were found during the course of the study. Sporadic statistically significant
variations of eosinophil, reticulocyte and monocyte counts, as well as the HCT and
MCHC at collection periods of 26 weeks or less. were found. No-statistically or

‘ biologically significant hematological differences from control animals were found in
blood samples collected after 51 weeks of Dimethomorph treatment.

Results - Although statistical differences occurred, most clinical chemistry results were
unremarkable and of no biological significance. The study authors reported statistically
Significant increases of ALK activity in dogs treated with 1350 ppm Dimethomorph from
week 13 through the remainder of the study and the A/G ratio of female dogs treated
with 450 or 1350 ppm Dimethomorph at weeks 13 and 51 of exposure (Table 4). The
decreased A/G ratio of female dogs is not biologically significant. The increase in ALK
activity was twofold (males) to threefold (females) by the end of the study and there was
a wide variation in the ALK activities of dogs in all treatment groups, The significance
