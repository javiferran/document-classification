evaluate the first issue of Parenting TEENS newsletter. | don't feel that I've captured all of
our thinking so | very much welcome your input.

Please advise. Thanks!

Carolyn,

You may re-call that last month, you asked that we develop a plan to research the first issue of
Parenting TEENS newsletter. Linda, Jeanne, Nancy and I met to discuss how we might do this and
determined that there didnâ€™t seem to be a need to do so at this time. Specifically, as we used actual
copies of the publication in our last round of qualitative research, we are not sure what more we will
learn. Further, JLJ Publishing will ask recipients to advise if they wish to continue to receive copies
of the newsletter. The number of those that respond will, in part, inform us as to whether parents
find the publication useful and of interest.

As we have planned to produce two issues by year-end, we suggest that we conduct additional
qualitative research early next year, after we have two issues to evaluate and a better idea of how
many parents have indicated interest in the publication.
