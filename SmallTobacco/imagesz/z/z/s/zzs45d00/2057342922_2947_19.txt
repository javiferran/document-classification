4.4 Postnatal Physical Development

When evaluating studies of postnatal physical development, it should be kept in mind that
growth yaries not only with genetic influences (e.g., sex and parental height) and nutrition,
but also with social factors such as sociceconomic status, birth order, and family size
(Goldstein, 1971).

4.4.1 Overview of Human Studies of Postnatal Physical Development
and Maternal Smoking During Pregnancy

Active maternal smoking during pregnancy is generally considered to cause significant
decreases in birthweight (U.S. DHHS, 1980). There is also evidence that body length at
birth is affected by smoking during pregnancy (Persson ef a/., 1978). Birthweight, which
is also a significant predictor of physical development, may be an intervening variable
between prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke and growth. There may also be an effect of
prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke independent of birthweight. A review of the topic is
contained in Rush and Calfahan (1989).

Several studies, some involving thousands of children, have examined the relationship
between maternal smoking during pregnancy and height, and have found that children of
smokers are slightly shorter than children of nonsmokers. The largest height decrements
were seen in studies by Dunn et al. (1976) and Naeye (1981). Dunn ef al. (1976), in an
uncontrolled study, reported differences of 1.6-2.0 cm for normal birthweight children
aged 4-6.5 years. Naeye (1981), in a sibling pair comparison, found the offspring of
smoke-exposed pregnancies were 1.7 cm shorter than their non-exposed siblings. Among
studies of pre-pubertal children that controlled for a variety of social factors, height
decrements for offspring of maternal heavy smokers (at least 10 cigarettes per day) ranged
from 0.7-1.0 cm (Hardy and Mellits, 1972; Goldstein, 1971; Butler and Goldstein, 1973;
Wingerd and Schoen, 1974). The last three papers reported mean heights of children
whose mothers were moderate smokers to be intermediate between those of children

whose mothers were heavy smokers and nonsmokers.
