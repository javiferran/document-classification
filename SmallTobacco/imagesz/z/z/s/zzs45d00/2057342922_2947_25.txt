In Ronaer ai. (1985) and Chinn and Rona (1991), areasonably good measure of ETS-
exposure-was obtained (number of cigarettes smoked:at home by parents), and analyses
were controlied for prenatal exposure to maternal active smoking. These studies found an
extremely small ETS effect (-0.2 cm) and no effect, respectively. When the 1985 data
were reanalyzed using the same methods employed for the 1991 data, the height
decrement diminished by a third and list statistical significance. These results imply that if

any effect of ETS exposure on height exists, it is vanishingly small.

Although there are plausible mechanisms through which ETS exposure could impact
postnatal height growth (e.g., impairment of appetite; increased frequency of illness), there
is little to no epidemiological evidence that ETS exposure has a significant effect on height
growth of children. A single animal study of postnatal sidestream smoke exposure did find
reduced growth rates in exposed animals; however, the lack of pair-fed controls in this
study limits the conclusions which can be drawn from its results. Although a relatively
small number of studies have addressed this issue, to-date the evidence that postnatal ETS
exposure is an independent hazard to height growth is difficult to characterize but is

judged to be null.
4.5 Respiratory Development and Function

The impact of ETS exposure on the respiratory tract has been reviewed by a number of
authoritative bodies (U.S. DHHS, 1986; NRC, 1986; U.S. EPA, 1992). Drawing on these
reports as well as more recent literature, acute and chronic non-cancer respiratory health
effects (and populations especially sensitive to these effects) are discussed in-depth in the
chapter of the overall ETS assessment entitled Respiratory Health Effects af Exposure to

Environmental Tobacco. Smoke.
