and Berkey et al.'s (1984) finding that ETS exposure was not related to rate of growth
Suggests that the effect is specifically associated with in utero exposure to maternal active

smoking.

At least half of the effect on height appears to be related to reductions in birthweight
among offspring of smokers. As maternal smoking is known to cause reductions in
birthweight, and as birthweight is a Predictor of height (Goldstein, 1971), it is plausible
that in utero exposure to maternal active smoking could result in small reductions in
height growth.

Five poorly controlled studies have found small inverse relationships between maternal
smoking during pregnancy and children's postnatal weight growth. More work is required
before any conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect of active smoking during

pregnancy and children's weight.

In summary, the evidence suggests that the relationship between active maternal smoking
during pregnancy and impaired height growth: in the pre-adolescent child may be causal.
Even though the effect is very small, its consistency is impressive. Dose-response
relationships have been repeatedly demonstrated, and there are plausible mechanisms to
explain the association, However, it is unlikely that a height decrement of approximately

"one centimeter has any functional significance.
4.4.4.2 Postnatal Physical Development and ETS exposure

Using paternal smoking as a proxy for postnatal ETS exposure, Rantakallio (1983) and
Berkey et ai. (1984) found very small, nonsignificant negative correlations with height
after adjusting for maternal smoking, Berkey et al. (1984) found no association between
current maternal or paternal smoking and the rate of growth, suggesting that height
decrements seen in children of smokers reflect differences that exist at birth (see
discussion above regarding the association of maternal active smoking during pregnancy
and postnatal height).
