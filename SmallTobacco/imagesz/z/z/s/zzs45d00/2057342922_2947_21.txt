4.4.2 Human Studies of Postnatal Physical Development and ETS Exposure

4.4.2.1 ETS Exposure of the Mother During Pregnancy

No studies were found that specifically examined the relationship of ETS exposure of the

mother during pregnancy to the postnatal height or weight growth of the child.

4.4.2.2 Postnatal ETS Exposure

Five studies have evaluated the association between some indicator of postnatal ETS

exposure and height (Table 4-3). No studies were found of ETS exposure and children's

postnatal weight growth.

Rona et al. (1981; 1985) and Chinn and Rona (1991)

Three studies have been conducted by Rona and colleagues using cross-sectional data
from the ongoing British National Study of Health and Growth. In their initial study of
4,961 primary school children in England and Scotland, Rona et ai, (1981) found an
inverse association between the number of people smoking more than five cigarettes per
day at home and the standardized height of the child. Height differences could not be
calculated from the data presented. Results remained significant after adjustment for

birthweight, age, sex, social class, and parental height. Prenatal exposure to tobacco

smoke was not assessed.

Rona ef af, (1985) refined their exposure assessment by ascertaining the total number of
cigarettes per day smoked at home by both parents. Forty-three percent of fathers, and
34% of mothers smoked in this sample. After adjusting for prenatal exposure to maternal
smoking, parental height, infant birthweight, age, sex, degree of overcrowding, and
number of siblings, children of smokers were still slightly but significantly shorter than
non-exposed children (p<0.01). The adjusted height decrement was small: approximately
0.2 cm for every 10 cigarettes smoked at home. Father's smoking, mother's current

smoking, and smoking during pregnancy were all independently associated with height.
