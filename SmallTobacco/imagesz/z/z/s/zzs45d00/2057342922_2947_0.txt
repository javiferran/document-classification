Schoendorf and Kiely (1992)

The first study to independently examine maternal smoking during and after pregnancy

- was published by Schoendorf and Kiely (1992). They performed a case-control analysis of
data from the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey. Within this dataset, 201
black and 234 white autopsied SIDS cases were identified from death certificates;
approximately 3,000 controls for each race were used. The analysis was restricted to
infants weighing >2,500 grams at birth. Mothers were questioned regarding their level of
cigarette consumption during pregnancy and at the time of interview, and from their
responses categorized as nonsmokers, smokers after pregnancy only, or smokers during
and after pregnancy. After adjustment for maternal age, education, and marital status,
maternal smoking only after pregnancy had an OR of 1.8 (CI 1.0, 3.0) for whites and 2.3
(C1 =1.5, 3.7) for blacks. The risk of SIDS among infants of women who smoked both
during and after pregnancy was 3.1 (CI =2.3, 4.2) and 3.1 (CI =2.2, 4.3) for whites and
blacks respectively. The ORs for “passive” (postnatal) and “combined” (pre- and
postnatal) exposure were not directly comparable, as mothers who smoked during and
after pregnancy tended to smoke more cigarettes per day than mothers who smoked only
after pregnancy. The authors also examined the risk of SIDS in relation to the presence of
other smokers in the household. In whites, household smoking was significantly
associated with SIDS (OR=1.4, CI=1.0, 1.9), but no relationship was seen in blacks
(OR=0.9, CI 0.7, 1.3). This latter analysis controlled for mother's smoking status only.

Mitchell et al, (1993)

Final results from the New Zealand case-control study were published in Mitchell ef al.
(1993). The study's catchment area covered 78% of all live births in New Zealand during
the 3-year study period. Four hundred eighty-five SIDS cases were compared to 1,800
controls. Case infants were much more likely than were control infants to have mothers
who had smoked in the two weeks prior to interview (OR=4.1, CI=3.3, 5.1). The OR
decreased to 1.7 (CI=1.2, 2.3) but was still significant at the p=0.05 level after adjusting

for: region, season, breastfeeding, and bed sharing; mother's marital status, socioeconomic
