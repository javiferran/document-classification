83.

Fox et al. (1990) compared 3-year-old children of women who smoked throughout
pregnancy with children of women who had quit, and also found an adjusted height
difference of 1.0 cm. Studies of the British National Child Development Study cohort at

16 and 23 years of age have shown that the effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy
appears to persist beyond puberty, although the size of the effect is not consistent
(Fogelman, 1980; Fogelman and Manor, 1988). The sole exception to this pattern was
reported by Fried and O'Connell (1987), who failed to find a significant negative
correlation between children's height and mothersâ€™ smoking status during pregnancy. The
point estimate was not presented, so the direction of the association is not known.
However, a subsequent larger study taken from the same cohort found children of heavy
smokers to be significantly shorter than children of nonsmokers (Fried and Watkinson,

1988). The presentation of data did not allow a specific height difference to be identified.

The effect of adjusting height differences for birthweight has been explored in three study
populations. Goldstein (1971), and Fogelman and Manor (1988), using data from the
National Child Development Study, found that adjusting for birthweight reduced height
differences by 30-60%. Fox ef al. (1990) corroborated this finding, calculating a 50%
reduction of effect. The much smaller study by Hardy and Mellits (1972) (88 children of
maternal smokers) reported that differences in height were completely eliminated when

birthweight was taken into account.

Hardy and Mellits (1972), Dunn ef al. (1976), Naeye (1981), Fried and Watkinson (1988)
and Fox et al. (1990) also examined prenatal exposure to maternal smoking and children's
weight. All five studies found small negative associations with maternal smoking, but the
effect was significant only in Naeye's sibling pair comparison. Both Fox ef al. (1990) and
Hardy and Mellits (1972) reported that the effect disappeared when birthweight was
controlled.
