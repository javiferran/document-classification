ETS Exposure

4.3.2.1 ETS Bxposure of the Mother During Pregnancy

Only one paper (Makin ef al, 1991) that addressed ETS exposure of the mother during
pregnancy was identified.

Makin et al. (1991)

Makin e7 al, (1991) administered an extensive neuropsychological test battery to children
of women who were active mmokers, exposed to ETS, and not exposed to ETS during
pregnancy. Assessment of exposure to ETS was prospective but imprecise, az it was
ascertained by asking subjects during pregnancy "Are you regularly exposed to a amoke-
filled environmentâ€™?", There were less than 35 children in each exposure group, Measures
of language, intelligence, and attention were outcomes thst significantly distinguished non-
exposed, ETS-exposed, and active smoking mothers in a disoriminant function analysis.
Scores of children of ETS-exposed mothers tended to fall between scores of children of
non-exposed and active smoking mothers. No adjustment was made for potential
confounders, as the authors stated that none were related to both tobacco smoke exposure
and outcome.

4.3.2.2 Postnatal ETS Exposure

Of six studies of neuropsychological development that have assessed effects of some
measure of postnatal RTS exposure, four focused on cognitive ability and two focused on
behavioral outcomes, Thess six atudies are reviewed below and summarized in Tables 4-
