A B. Subttlis. TRANSFORMATION

Fluorescent trpt transformants were observed
following treatment. of wild-type DNA with HNO?
(positive control). The B. subtilis assay system
is now operational in our hands. |

Experiments were begun to measure the effects
of IRI and X6D0AD (AD) whole smoke condensates (WSC's)
on the activity of transforming) DNA. Preliminary
results showed that both WSC's had no toxic effects
on the cell's under the conditions used.

‘Be = S. Typhimurium MUTATION

1. Liquid Culture: Replicate experiments
were performed in which mutant cells were
grown for 18-22 hours in the presence of
different doses of IRI WSC. The results
to date indicate that IRI WSC does not in-
duce mutations at a significant level
(>2X spontaneous) in either the base sub-
stitution mutant (TA 1535) or the frame-
shift mutant (TA 1538).?

2. Soft Agar Overlay (Disc. Test): Preliminary
results supported the results of liquid
culture experiments- (see above). Neither
IRI nor AD: WSC was active in producing a
significant number of his* revertants in.
the TA 1535 and TA 1538 tester strains.
