Subject: Deutsche Telekom Assessment

Dear all,

You received on Friday 18th a note fram Jean-Marc Genier which explains the status and responsibilities concerning
the MIS Business Partners Assessment in the EU Region. As you saw in the "Roles & Responsibilities: table, EU is
tesponsible for the assessment of Deutsche Telekom. We already received a fax from INBIFO saying that Deutche
Telekom answered to their RFi and that they confirmed in writing to comply with ali Y2K requirements in due course.

Deutsche Telekom is a High critical MIS Business Partner and our methodology requires an on-site survey. We see
here a synergy opportunity between PMF and INBIFO (and of course KJS Germany). Could you please discuss
together and Jet us know who is going to take in charge the visit.

Best regards,

Salvatore Dino
