Title:

21-Day Smoke Inhalation Study with Cigarette Smoke of Standard Reference Cigarette
Type 2R1 on Sprague Dawley Rats

Sister Chromatid Exchange and Chromosome Aberrations in Peripheral Blood
Lymphocytes

SD: DBE Experimental Part: 1982

Objective:

Investigate the response of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and chromosome
aberrations (CA) in peripheral lymphocytes to cigarette smoke exposure in rats

Cigarette Codes:
2R1

Test Parameter:
SCE, CA in peripheral lymphocyies

Study Design:

9 groups with 58 or 60 male Sprague Dawley rats, each; head-only exposed for 210 or
420 min/d, 7 d/w on 7, 14, 21, and 28 consecutive days to between 180 and 560 pg/l
TPM, followed by a 15-d postinhalation period

Results / Comments:

« Cigarette smoke exposure, if any at all, leads only to a marginal increase in SCE in
peripheral blood lymphocytes.

*« Cigarette smoke exposure does not induce chromosome aberrations in peripheral
lymphocytes.
