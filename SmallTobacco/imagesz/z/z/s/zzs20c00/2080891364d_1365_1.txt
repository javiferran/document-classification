Hi Sue,

I read your message that you received the PATMR stuff and itis in review. We can discuss
status tomorrow on the conference call.

I have another project were I will be needing your help. We are working on a corporate
mailing which is exactly as the mailing sent in the US, but we are not offering coupons for a
free pack, only a free lighter if we get back their photocopy ID and request form, Loren communicated
to Pat that she has 10M Djeeps available for our mailing in PR. But I have no idea of what
procedure we need to follow? Please fet me know if you can help me.

Also, I will be in NY next week and I was planning on meeting on Thursday with the
purchasing team, Pat will get back with timing and location.

Thanks always,
LOURDES
