The trans epoxide can be exclusively obtained by hydrating the
epoxide mixture in the presence of dilute acid. The cis isomer hydrates
to form 1-~hydroxyneocarvomenthol (IV) at a substantially faster rate
and leaves the desired trans isomer in good purity.

The second advantage of the new process is lower cost. Although the
epoxide yields by the hypochlorous acid method are not as good as those
using peracid, the nominal price of the reactants far offsets the yield
disadvantage. Epoxide yields of 32% have been realized by this method and
can no doubt be improved with further work. Epoxide yields of 70% have
been obtained by the bromohydrin method. The disadvantage in cost of
the bromohydrin method is somewhat overcome by the fact that this method
yields stereospecifically the desired trans isomer. The cost could be

improved by reclamation and sale of bromide wastes. A cost comparison
is given in Table I].
