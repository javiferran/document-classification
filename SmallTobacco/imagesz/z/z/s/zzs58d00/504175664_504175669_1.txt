The halohydrin route has a twofold advantage over the peracid method.
In the first place, the peracid epoxidation yields approximately equal.
amounts of the cis and trans epoxides while the halohydrin route provides
a convenient method for an essentially stereospecific preparation of the
trans epoxide which is desirable for use in the synthesis of menthol. |
The trans isomer (I) can be stereospecifically transformed to 2~menthene-1-ol
(II), a menthol precursor, while the cis isomer (III) yields compounds which
are not useful in the menthol synthesis. The equations below are illustrative
(1, 2, 3).

A comparison of the two methods of preparation for the menthene epoxides
is given in Table I. The stercospecificity of the halohydrin method is
readily apparent.
