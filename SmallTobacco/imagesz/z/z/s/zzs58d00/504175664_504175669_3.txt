' The 1-menthene epoxides are valuable intermediates for preparation
of 1~hydroxyneocarvomenthol, carvomenthol, carvomenthone, 2-menthene-l-ol,
carvotanacetone, isocarvotanacetol, carvotanacetol, piperitols, piperitone,
menthols, and menthone. A number of these compounds have desirable organo-
leptic properties and are used extensively in flavorings and pharmaceuticals.

This process could also be used with 3-menthene to prepare 3-menthene -
epoxide which is employed in the preparation of menthone and menthols
(Tenneco Chemical Company). The preparation of the limonene epoxides is

also feasible by this process.

The inventors recommend that further work be carried out to refine
the process described above and that the patentability of the process be
