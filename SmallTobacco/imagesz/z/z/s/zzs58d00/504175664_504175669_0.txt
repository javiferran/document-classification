A NEW PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF 1~MENTHENE EPOXIDES

SUMMARY:

Exploratory work has shown that the reaction of 1-menthene with
hypochlorous and hypobiomous acid forms halohydrins which upon treatment
with base yield 1-menthene epoxides. The preparation of menthene epoxides
by this method has not been previously reported.

The proposed invention is advantageous because it yields predominately
the trans isomer by a potentially cheaper method than is currently employed
for the preparation of a 1:1 mixture of the cis and trans l-menthene oxides.
The trans epoxide is particularly valuable in that it can be stereospecifically
transformed to 2-menthene-l-ol, an important intermediate in the synthesis of
menthol (1). The menthene oxides are also useful as intermediates for the
preparation of a number of compounds which have desirable organoleptic
properties and are used extensively in flavorings and pharmaceuticals.

MEMORANDUM :

The reaction of l-menthene to form the 1~menthene epoxides can be
. carried out by two methods as shown below.
