@... Ronald ee DATE: November 12, 1993
FROM: William Lynch, Records Management

SUBJECT: DISPOSITION OF NYO INVENTORY ITEMS

Records Management has been asked by Senior Management to notify
departments who maintain non-record items at the Carlstadt Records Center
of their inventory and request their review.

The attached NYO Inventory Item Printout lists materials from your
department stored at the Carlstadt, N.J. facility. In addition, a
Disposition Form is also enclosed for your completion. Due to facility
space constraints and a lack of retrieval activity, we are asking that you
review the items and, if they are no longer required to conduct Company
business, authorize destruction or reduce inventory balance.

To approve destruction, please enter your authorized signature in the space

provided on Part A. If the items have to be stored, or the inventory count

reduced, provide instructions and enter your signature on Part B.

A response is appreciated within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date

of this notice. Upon return of the Disposition Forms, a report will be
@>xeparea for John Tucker. |

Thank you in advance for your assistance.
