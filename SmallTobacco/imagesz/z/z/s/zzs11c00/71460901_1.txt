Re: Proposed forums September 17, 1999

There are some aspects of the proposed forums that concern me, and we
could speak about this.

I tried a sequence of topics that might serve in the introductory speech, as
here attached.

Alternative or additional forum subjects could be:
e The relationship of taxation and illegal trade.
e The legality and faimess of taxing smokers.

e What should be the liability of the industry in the post-settlement
context, given that the industry has been reduced to the role of tax
collector.

¢ Who profits and who shoulders ethical responsibilities while cigarettes
remain a legal product.

Let me know..... .
