In sponsoring these forums we hope to clarify what our future, what our
position in society, and what our liabilities might be. At this junction in
history we are still producing and marketing a legal product, but now
more than ever our regulated profits pale in comparison to the taxes and
penalties we collect on behalf of our controlling partners. We wish to
know whether we and our hapless customers - the smokers who are
asked to foot an enormous bill - are to continue taking the legal rap and
public opprobrium simply for being coerced as tax collectors and tax

payers.
