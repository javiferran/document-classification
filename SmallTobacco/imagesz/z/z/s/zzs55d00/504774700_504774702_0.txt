Purpose

To compare True (L-11,942A) to a DORAL estron prototype (L~12,059B)
among Hi-Fi non-menthol smokers.

Test Method

A paired two cigarette mall intercept test was conducted by Dwight Spencer
and Associates. L-11,942A was compared to L-12,059B by 60 Hi-Fi (less than 15 mg.)
smokers. These panelists were asked to rate each cigarette on ten smoking
attribute statements. The scores represent a range of 1 to 7, in which 4.0 is
the mean. The lower the score the greater the agreement with the statement; and
the higher the score the greater the disagreement with the statement. Also,
the panelists were asked for overall preference and to compare each product to

( their usual brand. The smokers were broken down into four groups:

Reynolds Smokers 35 & over
Competitive Smokers 35 & over
Reynolds Smokers under 35
Competitive Smokers under 35

See attachment.
Conclusions
The two products were near parity in preference although significant differences

in smoking attributes were noticed. True was perceived as having a milder, smoother
taste, whereas, DORAL was noted as being stronger and harsher.
