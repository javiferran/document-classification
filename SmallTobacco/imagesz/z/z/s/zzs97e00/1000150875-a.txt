lowest point since 1957, seven years before the.-

surgeon general first issued warnings about the
link between smoking and lung cancer. Apparent-

_hazards. Further efforts to educate the public on
the subject could have even further desirable im-

That’s why states should prohibit smoking in most

public places unless separate zones are established

forsmokersand nonsmokers. .  ......
