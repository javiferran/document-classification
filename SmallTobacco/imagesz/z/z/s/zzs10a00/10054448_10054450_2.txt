tions are shown in Fig 2 This figure
shows the extent both of the chrono-
logical age effect and the smoking
change effect. It can be seen from Fig
2 that younger men (below age 50) in
all emoking categories tended to gain
more weight than did older men. It is
also clear that the recent excigarette
ameoker group (quit smoking) experi-
enced the largest overall weight gain
among all other groups. The overall
weight gained by the excigarette
group was calculated to be 1.9 kg (4.2
lb) more than the weight gained by
the men in the other smoking groups.

It should be noted that although
quitters had the largest overall in-
crease in weight, this does not indi-
cate that all quitters gained weight.
In fact 25% of the recent excigarette
smoker group either lost weight or
remained the same. However, more
nonquitters than quitters lost weight
during a five-year period

A better understanding of the
exact portion of weight gain attribu-
table to change in smoking status
may be obtained by examining Fig 3.
This figure compares the “quit smok-
ing” group with all the other smoking
groups combined. The area between
the curves can be interpreted as a
measure of the five-year weight
change for each cohort related to ces-
sation of cigarette smoking. From
Fig 3 it can be seen that at all ages,
giving up cigarettes increased overall
weight gain. The increase in weight
ls greatest for quitters between the
age of 40 to 54 and relatively less for
those under 40 or over 54 years. That
excigarette smokers in the age oo-
horts between 40 and & years tend to
gain more weight suggests that the
excess weight gain is at least in part

an effect of their giving up cigarettes.
Further support for the fact that the
excess weight gained by those be-
tween 40 and 54 years is an effect of
giving up cigarettes and not an aging
effect comes from the National
Health Surveys’ finding that men in
the 40- to 54-year-old age range, on
the average, show little change in
weight.'?

Comparative Importance of Chrono-
logical Age and Smoking Change in
Affecting Weight Change.—The rela-
tive importance of smoking change vs
chronological age in contributing to
weight change was computed by the
strength of association procedure ad-
vocated by Hays.'* As a result of this
computation, chronological age ac-
counted for approximately 5.1% of the
variance of weight change while ciga-
rette smoking behavior change ac
counted for 2.4%. While chronological
age is more important than smoking
cessation, smoking cessation is never-
theless related in a statistically sig-
nificant way to weight gain. Thus,
even after age is controlled, smoking
cessation does have a significant ef-
fect on increase in weight.

An interesting aspect of the
strength of association findings, how-
ever, is that. 92.6% of the variance of
weight change is unexplained by
chronolegical age and smoking behav-
ior change. This result serves to em-
phasize the importance of other fac-
tors that may be related to weight
change, such as dietary habits, exer
cise, emotional atability, and ao forth.

Since no information was recorded
concerning the point within the five-
year period at which a person stopped

amoking, we do not know the extent
to which weight gain may be a rela-
tively short-term phenomenon; that
is, we cannot determine whether or
not the weight gain occurred directly
following cessation. Further study of
this problem w.ll be necessary.
