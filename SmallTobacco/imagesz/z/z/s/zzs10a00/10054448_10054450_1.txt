ace GROUPS
Fig 2.—Weignte of men by amaking category, chronological age

group, and time period.

The independent variables in the two-
way anelyels of variance were chronclogi-
eal age and change in cigarette amoking.
Age was broken down into six groups: 20 to
34 yeare old, 35 to 89, 40 to 44, 45 to 49, 60
to 64, and 55 years and older. These age
groups represented the subjects’ ages at
time 1, fe, their ages at the time of their
fret examination. At time 2 the me of
the aubjects’ eecond examination, subjecta
were on the average five years older.

The dependent variable was weight
change from time 1 to time 2 recorded to

the nearest pound. Weight change in
pounds was converted later to weight
change in kilograms.

Before proceeding io the results of the
aralysia of variance, it seems desirable to
describe in more de:sil the characteristics
of the continuing cigarette smoker group
in terms of the change in the uumber of
cigarettes smoked from time 1 to time 2.
Figure 1 presents the change in cigarette
consumption from time 1 to time 2 by
chronological age group for these who con-
tinued smoking cigarettes. On the average,
men in the continuing cigarette smoker
group decreased about one cigarette per
day over a period of five years. This de-
crwase did not reach tho .06 level of statis-
tical significance when 6 repeated mea-
sures analysis of variance was applied and,
fer practical purposes, it can be ssid that
they were smoking essentially the same
number of cigarettes as they were five
years earlier.

Results

Analysis of Varience.—The resulta of
the two-way analysis of variance for
examining the effect of chronolagical
age and cigarette omoking on weight
change are shown in the Table. The F
values in this Table indicate that both
chronological age and smoking behav-
tor changes were significantly related
to weight change (P<.001 both for
tha chronological age and for amok-
ing behavior change effects). Since
plots of means are helpful in inter.
preting the results of analysis of vari-
ance designe,"® graphical presenta.
