Honourable Council:

-Our group is interested in doing research about possibie
- protective agents to prevent Parkinson’s disease development .

Recently, we found a protective effect of one of the components *
of tobacco in the experimental model of Parkinson’s disease in
mice, the MPTP model. We have sent an article with the results
of this study to a scientific journal.

Now, we want to extend this observation to human patients with
Parkinson’s disease and we would like to get financial support
for such a project. Thus, we will be very pleased to receive some
information about research grant applications or formats of your
organization to support scientific projects.

Thanking in advance for your kind consideration, I remain,

Sincerely your,
