1991 PLAN
NORTH DAKOTA

ROBERT E. FACKLER

SITUATION ANALYSIS

 

North Dakota has an 80 day state legislative session in 1991.
Prefiling of bills took place December 4-6, 1990. A bill banning
vending machines was prefiled.

The state excise tax on cigarettes was increased from .18 a pack
to .27 in July of 1987. Taxes started the year at .30 per pack.
A sunset provision taking place on 7/91 will lower the tax by .03
to .27 per pack.

Cigarette Excise Tax Increase: It is likely that a bill to
repea] the "Sunset Clause" that lowers the tax on cigarettes
.03 per pack and is scheduled to take effect July 1, 1991 will
be introduced. It would keep the tax on a pack of cigarettes
at .30 per pack. There is also a strong anti-tax sentiment
in ND. But a repeal of the Sunset Clause is an easier vote
for the legislature than a new tax increase. For this reason,
I feel it could pass. The SRGs wil] be working to fight the
repeal.

Other Tobacco Taxes: A bill increasing taxes on other tobacco
products will likely be introduced. With the strong anti-tax
sentiment in ND a vote for an increase in new taxes would be
a much tougher vote than a repeal of the Sunset Clause. There
is 50\50 chance of this one passing. Any Tax increase is
unacceptable to the SRGs and they will be opposing it.

Smoking Restrictions: A Clean Indoor Air bill will likely be
introduced. Some parts of it could very well pass. The SRGs
have fought smoking restrictions in the past and will continue

to make this issue a priority.

Sampling Ban: There is a 50/50 chance that a bill will be
introduced. It is however, unlikely to pass. North Dakotan's
are notorious for not wanting Government to interfere with the

business community.
