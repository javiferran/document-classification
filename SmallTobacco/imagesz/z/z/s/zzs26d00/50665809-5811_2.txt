2. Biochemical characterization of the interactions of neu/erbB2 with erbB3. Given that
the growth factor heregulin binds to the neu/erbB2 tyrosine kinase in some cells (e.g. mammary
carcinomas, pheochromocytoma cells) but does not bind to neu/erbB2 in fibroblasts or in insect cells, and
that heregulin does bind to erbB3 in all cell systems tested (including insect cells), we have postulated that
a heterodimer comprised of the neu/erbB2 tyrosine kinase and the erbB3 protein is a high affinity target for
heregulin and that neu/erbB2 can phosphorylate erbB3 in a here ulin-dependent manner. We will test
these possibilities by developing reconstituted phospholipid vesicle systems containing the recombinant,
purified neu/erbB2 and erbB3 proteins. We will examine if high affinity binding of heregulin to a
neu/erbB2-erbB3 heterodimer can be inhibited by different forms of the erbB3 ED or by anti-erbB3
antibodies that are being generated.

3. Delineation of EGF receptor-erbB3 or neu/erbB2-erbB3 signaling pathways.
Phosphorylated tyrosine residues of the erbB3 protein are predicted to constitute a consensus region for
binding the SH-2 domain of src. Thus, an attractive hypothesis for a signaling cascade is that heregulin
binding to erbB3 stimulates the formation of a high affinity (heregulin)-erbB3-neu/erbB2 ternary complex
that enables neu/erbB2 to phosphorylate erbB3 at specific binding sites for src. Similarly, the formation of
an EGF receptor-erbB3 heterodimer could couple EGF binding to the recruitment of the stc kinase to an
EGF receptor-erbB3 heterodimer. In this series of studies, we will examine the possible interactions of
the neu/erbB2 tyrosine kinase (or the EGF receptor) with erbB3 and the src t rosine kinase in lung
carcinoma cells. Specifically, anti-erbB3 antibodies that are being generated, as well as anti-EGF receptor,
anti-neu/erbB2, anti-sre, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies that are available in the laboratory will be
used to identify EGF receptor-erbB3, neu/erbB2-erbB3, and erbB3-src interactions in different lung
cancer cells through immunoprecipitation experiments. These studies will be complemented by in vitro
studies where we will take advantage of the development of insect cell expression systems for EGF
receptor, neu/erbB2, erbB3, and c-sre to reconstitute an EGF-stimulated, or a heregulin-stimulated,
signaling pathway using purified components.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES-FEASIBILITY

The overall goal of the proposed studies is to delineate the role of the erbB3 protein in the signaling
pathways of the EGF receptor and neu/erbB2, with the ultimate aim of determining the importance of this
protein in both normal and aberrant growth regulation. At the present time, virtually nothing is known
about the biochemical activities of erbB3 or its participation in growth factor-coupled signal transduction.
Our laboratory has developed a number of insect cell expression systems for the individual members of the
subclass 1 receptor tyrosine kinases as well as protocols for the purification of these receptors to apparent
homogeneity. e also have developed procedures for reconstituting these receptors into phospholipid
bilayers. Thus, while the proposed studies will be labor intensive, we nonetheless feel that we have
expertise in the necessary approaches to allow us to examine the interactions between the EGF receptor or
neu/erbB2 and erbB3 in a well defined manner. We also intend to take advantage of these biochemical
approaches to examine the role of the src kinase in the signaling pathways of the EGF receptor or
neu/erbB2, as mediated via the ‘adapter’ action of the erbB3 protein. An important aim will be to
reconstitute these signaling pathways and to demonstrate that they are operating in the control of lung cell
growth. Toward that end, we will take advantage of different antibody reagents that we have generated or
are available in the laboratory for immunoprecipitation studies performed in different lung cancer cells.
We also intend to examine the potential use of different erbB3 antibodies and limit domains in modulating
EGF receptor and nev/erbB? signaling as a possible novel source of therapeutic reagents.
