Subject: Variable Speed Motor Drives for Line I Tunnel Dryer Fans

Attached for your review and consideration is a Purchase Requisition
in the amount of $80,415. These monies are to cover the associated
costs to install nine (9) variable speed motor drives on line I Tunnel
Dryer Fans. This expenditure is part of Appropriation No. B-257, J.0.
No. 7871.

The recommended single source is Electric Motor & Contracting Co.

(E .M.C}. This vendor provides the most economical and best quality
Toshiba drive at the best price and delivery. They will provide
training, engineering and installation assistance at little or no
additional cost. An analysis of various drive considerations is
attached.

This project is scheduled to begin during the November, 1990 Line I
Shutdown.

Please request written bids from E.M.c. and Alpha Drive Systems for
the attached Toshiba drives. Delivery of the Toshiba Variable Speed
Motor Drives can be obtained through E.M.C. within the next three to
four weeks. This allows enough time to complete the physical
installation of the drives prior to shutdown. Final wiring and
control installation and testing could then be completed within the
plant shut down time frame.
