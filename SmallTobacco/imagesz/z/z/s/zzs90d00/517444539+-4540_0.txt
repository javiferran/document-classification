We received today a draft of the trans-ANETHOLE Monograph for JECFA purposes from Dr. Ian
Munro/Ms. Elke Kennepoh! (CanTox,Inc.).

Each member of the FEMA-FEXPAN plus John Hallagan and Tim Adams have received their copies
from CanTox Inc. The FEMA-FEXPAN will conducts its review of the draft Monograph to :(A)
Examine the approach employed for the preparation; (B) Coordinate the interaction of this draft
Monograph to related work (interpretive summaries) and associated effort within the structurally
related chemical class (group); and (C) To prepare pro- and con- criticism and commentary for
CanTox’s re-drafting, leading to the final copy for submission to JECFA.

Related but coordinated work for the FAO specifications and analytical methodology for submission
to FAO must also be accomplished within the same time reference as for JECFA.

In order to meet the submission schedule for JECFA, currently targeted for December 1, 1997, Dr.
Ian Munro and his Monograph preparation staff_urgent requests that_he receive all commentary by

September 30th so these comments are in CanTox's possession on October 1, 1997.

For all commentary, please address these remarks in writing for letter or facsimile transmission to:
