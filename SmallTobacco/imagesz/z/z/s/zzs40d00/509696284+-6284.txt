Subject: Pesticide Residues Date: November 18, 1994

To: Ms. Diane Roberts From: Ms. Jennifer Bailey

In response to your request for information on two competitive brand syles, DAVE’s FF and
FFLT, I have reviewed various sources of information to determine the potential source of
this leaf based on the pesticide residues detected in product samples labeled 521 and 615.
Unfortunately, no conclusions can be made in this regard.

While residues of endosulfan and maleic hydrazide were detected, these two pesticides are
used/registered for use in several countries. Also, the residues are well below any of the limits
that have been established in these countries. Furthermore, these two pesticides can be
applied to more than one type of leaf. Though there are differences in pesticide formulations
which may/may not account for residue content; the duration in the field, weather conditions,
etc., can impact the degradation of these pesticides. Lastly, the effects of blending can dilute
the residue content in the final product.

Please let me know if] can be of further assistance to you.
