“+ On December 17, 1976, ‘the following people
from New York will visit the Research Center to
discuss 5 mg products:

Bob Fitzmaurice ae Dick Gumz
Bill Engelbrecht “+> Skip Long
“AL Bissmeyer (perhaps).
I would appreciate your leading these
discussions. They are particularly interested in
5 mg Parliament and a 5 mg free-standing brand. Please

have minutes of the discussion prepared for distribution
to Mr. W. McDowell and Mr. F. Resnik.

It might be a good time to expose these
marketing types to the high-speed photographs of smoke
issuing from various filters, particularly Parliament.

- If you “have any questions, please let me
_ know. egy we .
