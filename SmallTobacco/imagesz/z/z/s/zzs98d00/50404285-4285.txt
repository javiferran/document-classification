Dear Frank:

This letter is to indicate my enthusiastic willingness to collaborate with your group on your
current exciting project to examine the localization and regulation of neurotensin receptors
and their interactions with the dopamine receptors.

As you know, we have made significant progress in characterizing the behavioral and
physiological effects of antisense oligonucleotide administration to knock down each
dopamine receptor subtype. These rats will be made available to you, and should be useful
in examining the long-term effects of neurotensin on different dopamine receptors.

All best wishes and success in obtaining funding for your project.
Yours sincerely,

Tan Creese Ph.D.
Professor and Co-Director
