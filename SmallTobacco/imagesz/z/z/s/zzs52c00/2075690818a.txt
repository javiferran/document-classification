Mike, as I explained in the voice mail message I left you, that plan should
not be executed yet. I have sent it to Amold & Porter for review, and we
haven't cleared it internally yet. Please put the brakes on the execution
of the plan until I get Jim Sandmanâ€™s views on the plan, and we clear it
internally. If you have any questions, give me a call.
