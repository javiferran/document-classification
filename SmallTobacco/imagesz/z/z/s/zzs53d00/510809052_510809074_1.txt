public health, welfare, or safety", and empowers the
Administrator "to test emissions and to require manufacturers to

conduct such tests".

The HEI research program, up and running since 1983, is
active in roughly 45 laboratories researching health issues
related to carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and diesel
emissions. HEI, located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, operates on

an annual budget of about $6 million.

In July 1984 the HEI industrial sponsors, who are members of
the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, asked the Health
Effects Institute to "immediately undertake a review of the issue
concerning potential adverse health effects from refueling
vapor". EPA followed with a similar request in February 1985
when Dr. Bernard Goldstein, Assistant Administrator for Research
and Development, asked HEI to “complete an examination of
available and ongoing research on adverse health effects from
exposure to gasoline vapors" and to “identify important gaps that
should be addressed". Obviously, something was "on the line" and
that something was a pending regulation by EPA to enact controls
that would limit exposure to refueling vapors. The two most
attractive control strategies available to limit exposures are

 

Stage II pump-nozzle controls or absorptive onboard canisters.
One strategy obviously impacts the petroleum industry and the
other the auto industry, prompting each to praise the control
technology the other has available.

The Health Issue

Concern over the refueling vapors issue arose primarily from
the results of a single two-year animal carcinogen bioassay (the
PS-6 study) sponsored by the American Petroleum Institute
(API). This study was designed and implemented for purposes of
hazard identification, not for purposes of defining a dose-
response relationship. In the API chronic study rats, (Fischer
