Introduction

In 1985, the Health Effects Institute published an analysis
it conducted of the informational basis for quantifying cancer
risks from exposure to unleaded refueling vapors, an exposure
that mainly occurs while at the self-service pump. Using the
National Research Council's framework for risk assessment, the
HEI analysis concluded that important information was lacking in
the three areas that lead to the actual quantification of risk.
The three are: hazard identification, dose-response assessment,
and exposure assessment.

Before proceeding further with details of the analysis, a
quick word on the Health Effects Institute. HEI, a non-profit
corporation, was incorporated in 1980, to "conduct or support the
conduct of, and to evaluate, research and testing relating to the
health effects of emissions from motor vehicles". HEI is
cofunded equally by the the public and private sectors, the EPA
contributing 50 percent and the manufacturers of engines or
vehicles certified for use on U.S. highways contributing 50
percent. This arrangement was designed to minimize the
adversarial nature of the controversy surrounding the control of
auto emissions. In addition, HEI's establishment enabled the
industry to honor its legal obligation to sections 202(a) and
206(a) of the Clean Air Act, which were enacted in 1977, and
require that "after model year 1978, no emission control device
