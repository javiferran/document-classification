Gasoline Composition: Liquid and Vapors

Motor vehicle gasoline is a complex mixture composed of a
blend of various refinery streams and consists almost entirely of
hydrocarbons: alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, and aromatics. In
the API chronic study, the gasoline was entirely vaporized for
animal exposure, meaning that the inhaled mixture was essentially
identical to that in the liquid phase. This mixture is not
representative of the evaporative mix found in ambient situations
because of the differential volatility of the hydrocarbon
compounds present in gasoline. The larger hydrocarbon molecules
are less volatile and will, therefore, be present in lower
proportion in ambient vapors than in those generated in the API

study.

The differences in volatility are important because branched
alkanes with 6 or more carbons(2C-6) appear to be the compounds
most likely responsible for toxic effects in the kidneys
â€˜(nephrotoxicity) of male rats exposed to wholly vaporized
gasoline. (To date, hydrocarbon-induced renal pathology in male
rats is the endpoint of most concern for health risk
assessment.) Using a simple comparison, 100 ppm of wholly
vaporized gasoline is composed of roughly 8 ppm C-6, 5 ppm C-7,
and 20 ppm2C-8, whereas 100 ppm of ambient gasoline vapors
consists of about 7 ppm C-6, 3 ppm C-7, and 1 ppmzC-8. These
facts raise significant questions about the relevance to human
health of gasoline vapors used in the PS-6 study. For the
kidney-related endpoints, upon which much of the concern focuses,
such experiments may have overstated the toxic potential of

ambient environments.

Animal Models

Problems concerning the applicability of the experimental
animal models to humans compound the issue just discussed. In
