Another issue that deserves mention is the presence of
benzene in the PS-6 blend. Benzene is carcinogenic in humans as
well as in both sexes of mice and rats. One may, therefore,
question whether benzene contributed together with the other
gasoline hydrocarbons to the increased tumor burden in exposed
animals. However, the sex~ and site-specificity for
tumorigenesis in the PS-6 study are not consistent with the
findings of previous studies in which benzene was administered

alone and in high doses.

Exposure Assessment

Gasoline vapor exposure assessment is an area of great
interest and increasing activity. This increased focus is in
recognition of the limited data base currently available and the
need to fill existing gaps. Exposures to gasoline vapors occur
in both nonoccupational and occupational environments.
Nonoccupational populations include self-service customers in gas
stations, residents downwind of known sources such as refineries,
and occupants of dwellings with attached garages. Occupational
cohorts include refinery workers, workers in bulk plants and
terminals, tank truck drivers, and service station attendants.

Data collected for a number of scenarios provide a feel for
the levels of exposure likely to be encountered in some typical
situations. Halder et al reported 8-hour time-weighted average
(TWA) exposures in refineries on the basis of almost 5,000
samples collected by API member companies: 97.1% of the
exposures were less than 22.5 ppm; 2.4% from 22.5 to 112.3 ppm;
0.27% from 112.3 to 224.6 ppm; and 0.17% greater than 224.6
ppm. In another study, Clayton Environmental Consultants
measured gasoline vapor concentrations during refueling
operations at 13 gas stations. The average geometric mean during
unleaded refueling was 44 ppm, with a range of 14 to 89 ppm;
leaded was 52 ppm average (13-120 ppm); and premium was 50 ppm
average (18-110 ppm). |
