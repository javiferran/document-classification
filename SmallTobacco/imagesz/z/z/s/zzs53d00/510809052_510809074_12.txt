Summary

The following summarizes the uncertainties just discussed

grouped according to the step to which each uncertainty most
closely applies The HEI analysis deliberately did not deal with

risk characterization itself:

Hazard Identification

Based on results of the PS-6 study, and according to IARC
criteria, wholly vaporized unleaded gasoline is considered to
be an animal carcinogen and a presumptive human carcinogen.
However, the PS-6 study used a vapor mix significantly
different from the ambient vapors to which humans are exposed,
and the question remains as to whether a realistic mix would

have produced comparable responses in mice and rats.

The epidemiologic literature, though weakly suggestive of
carcinogenicity in several studies, remains inconclusive in
demonstrating effects from occupational exposures.

The research to date on the genotoxicity of gasoline is
negative. Thus, the observed carcinogenic effects of gasoline
in rodents may have arisen through promotion, a possibility
thus far untested in animal systems.

Effects unrelated to cancer resulting from exposure to
unleaded gasoline vapors at ambient concentrations have not
yet been thoroughly researched. At higher concentrations,
however, wholly vaporized unleaded gasoline causes nephrotoxic

effects in male rats.

Dose~Response Assessment

The key difficulty arises in quantitative extrapolation to
humans from the mouse and rat animal models, each of which
appears to have characteristics that render it a questionable
