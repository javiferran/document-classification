@ apparently operative in gasoline vapor-exposed-rats are of
questionable relevance to humans. The question remains open
whether humans are at increased risk of gasoline vapor-induced
kidney effects by alternative biological mechanisms.

(6) Specificity. Renal effects have not been shown
consistently in human studies. In a recent review of refinery
workers, however, Savitz and Moure show evidence of increased
risk for kidney cancer and other malignancies, including
melanoma, leukemia, and cancers of stomach, brain, and
pancreas. Such findings suggest that if the putative hydrocarbon
effects lack site specificity, the focus on renal effects may be

too narrow.

Therefore, additional study is required to clarify whether
there are causal links between human exposure to gasoline vapors
and disease-or site-specific morbidity and mortality. The API
has invested significant resources to help lessen the uncertainty

@ concerning risks to occupational cohorts.

Framework for Analysis

The central issue is whether currently available data on
gasoline vapors are adequate for quantitative risk
characterization. To address this question, the material
presented is abstracted and recast into the National Research
Council's (NRC) framework for risk assessment.

The NRC Committee divides the risk assessment process into
four steps. The steps, though identified separately, are not
mutually exclusive and are conceived as interactive.

(1) Hazard Identification: This process focuses on determination
of whether exposure to a substance can alter an individual's
state of health. This step serves as an alert to potential
ambient risk factors and may rely on data collected in human,
animal, cellular, or even sub-cellular studies.
