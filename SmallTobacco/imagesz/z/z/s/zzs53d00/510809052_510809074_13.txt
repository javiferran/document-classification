surrogate for man. The mouse strain used in the PS-6 study is
highly susceptible to the induction of liver tumors, and thus
May not appropriately represent the sensitivity of the general

human population. The relevance of the male rat kidney tumor
model is also questionable, since rats appear to metabolize
hydrocarbons differently than do other species.

o If gasoline vapors are not tumor initiators, but promoters or
cocarcinogens instead, then the multistage model may not be
appropriate for high/low dose extrapolation. In such a case,
other theoretical models may project risks that differ from
those of the multistage model.

o Human exposure to gasoline vapor, such as may occur in the
filling of fuel tanks, is typically sporadic and brief,
whereas the exposure of laboratory animals in the experiments
conducted to date has generally been more prolonged. The
extent to which such a difference in the duration of exposure
may influence the toxicokinetics of inhaled vapors, and hence
the effective dose of hydrocarbons to target cells in the
liver or kidney cannot be predicted with certainty from the
available data.

Exposure Assessment

o Temporal and chemical characteristics of exposures for various
sub-populations are lacking, but the data base is expanding.

o Absence of historical exposure data complicates interpretation
of the epidemiologic literature.
