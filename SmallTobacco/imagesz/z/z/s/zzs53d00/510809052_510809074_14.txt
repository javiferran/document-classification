Conclusion

This paper has reviewed briefly the issues that are germane
to an evaluation of potential public health effects from exposure
to refueling gas vapors. The PS-6 study presents data with which
one may, according to IARC criteria, classify gas vapors as an
animal carcinogen and a presumptive human carcinogen;
furthermore, the data from this study may be used to calculate an

upper-bound risk factor as the EPA has done.

However, the issue presents a two-edged sword that
complicates the applicability of the animal data to humans.
First, the animals were exposed to a wholly-vaporized blend
unrepresentative of the mixture found in ambient vapors and,
second, there is just reason to question each of the two animal
models used in the experiment. If either of these two edges were
blunted, the issue of characterizing risk to humans might have
been a lot clearer and perhaps subject to less scrutiny. This
was not the case, however, and the data available on exposure
assessment and epidemiology were insufficient or not clear enough
to overcome the problems with interpreting the animal
experiments.

Research is proceeding actively, exploring the uniquenss of
the male rat's response to hydrocarbons and on the health of
workers exposed to petroleum vapors. With the narrowing of the
informational gaps discussed here, a sound basis will form with
which to characterize risks from refueling vapors.
