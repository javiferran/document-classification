RIRT INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM

Subject: Freon 123/Freon 11 Date: April 10, 1990
Residue Decay
Study in Packaged
Cigarettes

To: Michael F. Borgerding From: Rhenda H. Steele

At RJRT, once tobacco is expanded, this tobacco can be used to
make cigarettes in approximately two to six hours. Once
cigarettes are made, the cigarettes can be in the consumer's hand
in as little as three to four weeks, although the industry
average is three to four months. With these times in mind, the
following sampling points have been chosen for the packaged
cigarette residue decay study:

Day 0 (remove cigarettes from freezer)
Day 1

Day 4

Day 7 (1 week)

Day 14

Day 21

Day 28 (1 month)
Day 42

Day 56 (2 months)
Day 70

Day 84 (3 months).

These data are needed in order to estimate smoker exposure to
Freon 123 by the August decision date. It is understood that
this study will probably need to be repeated once PT&D optimizes
the Freon 123 expansion process in order to obtain a more
accurate curve for consumer exposure assessment.
