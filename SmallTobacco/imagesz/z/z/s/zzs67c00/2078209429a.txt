Joe-

Per our conversation regarding old wholesale account # 53710 ( Box Wholesale)
being purchased by Discount Distributors, and the new KA# 59067 matching with
new customer number. 5

The account has been ordering product from CS as usual, however they have
been ordering under old# 53710. Richmond CS currently has #53710 as
Discount Distributors customer #. This is a huge problem for the account
receiving credit for purchases when their Midas KA# is 59067.

| spoke with Bobby Sherrill Accts. Receivable Supervisor / Richmond CS, and
they arecurrently receiving Discount Dist. #2 orders under #53710 ( sold fo ,
ship to) and Paying the bills is #39915 ( bill to, payer) Discount Distributors
parent company.

We need an interface built in to get the exchange for credit of purchases from
53710 to 59067.....

| am needing some direction to get this corrected in Richmond and ensure PM
STARS is receiving the tapes with the correct KA#.. purchases.
