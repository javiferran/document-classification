ing of the participation of these cells in human athero-
sclerosis and coronary plaque disruption. Most im-
portant, a better understanding of these cells may
provide new avenues for the prevention of athero-
sclerosis.

  

Effects of Vessel-Waill Stress on Plaque Disruption

As was stated in recent reviews,'*!5 alterations in
stresses on or within plaques may be important in
their disruption. Davies and coworkers analyzed ath-
erosclerotic coronary plaques in patients who died of
ischemic heart disease. They found that fissured
plaques commonly contained a lipid pool in the intima
and that the fissure frequently occurred at the junction
of the fibrous cap with the adjacent normal arterial
wall.!?°? Using computer modeling for analysis of ten-
sile stress across the vessel wall, these investigators
found high stresses on the plaque cap overlying an
area of lipid pool. In this area, the cap’s lack of under-
lying collagen support may make it more susceplible
to rupture. They suggested that the risk of fissuring
may be determined by the plaque configuration and
hy structural properties of the cap’s components.”
Aside from stress within the plaque, stress produced
by a disturbed pattern of blood flow in areas of steno-
sis’ may also contribute to tearing of the plaque,
particularly in the thinner portion of the fibrous cap.
Furthermore, sudden changes in coronary intralu-
minal pressure or tone?’*! and hending and twisting of
the artery during each heart contraction may also con-
tribute to plaque disruption. Clearly, the rale of me-
chanical or physical stresses in plaque disruption re-
quires further intensive investigation.
