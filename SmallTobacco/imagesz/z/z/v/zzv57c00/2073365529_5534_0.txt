susEcT: Misty Slims Flash Report (12/03/89) ,

American Tobacco began retail distribution of Misty Slims in
Bakersfield, California and Shreveport, Louisiana in August.
The brand is being tested at full margin in Bakersfield and
at generic prices in Shreveport.

According to sources in the wholesale trade, Full Priced
Misty Slims will expand its test to the state of California
and to Atlanta, Georgia in December, 1989.

e Misty Slims’ share remained at 0.4 in Shreveport
(Generic Priced) and increased one-tenth in Bakersfield
(Full Priced) to 1.0, from the previous period.
Similar to when last reported, the share difference
between the two markets appears to be due to the higher
levels of promotional support in Bakersfield, where 81%
of stores have at least one Misty Slims promotion
versus 20% in Shreveport.

e Bakersfield’s incentives include B1G1F’s, $3 off carton
purchase, free eye make-up with carton purchase and
free magazine (up to $3 value) with carton purchase.
The pantyhose with carton purchase and B1G1F’s continue
to be reported in Shreveport’s outlets. In addition,
only one store offered the free magazine with carton
promotion in the generic priced market.

e For the past two months, Shreveport’s distribution has
remained relatively constant at 64%. However,
distribution has increased +6% to 73% in Bakersfield.
