sugar are added to the wine and it is further fermented and aged for 2 years,
this time under pressure of the C02 formed. It is still necessary to remove
the sludge of dead ferment prior to marketing.

E, __ LIGNIN

Several papers were given on lignin (from wood) and I was able to learn
something about this important material. Lignin also occurs in the tobacco
leaf and stem,

Lignin has been described as "polymerized coniferyl alcohol," but care-
ful studies show that it is actually a complex mixture of polymers, some of
which have mlecular weights above 5,000. It is sulfonated and dissolved by
hot calcium bisulfite solution. Some of the lignin molecules are soluble in
water, and many are soluble in mixtures of water and either methanol, dioxane,

pyridine, or sodium hydroxide.

The most important recurring unit of the lignin molecules is the guaicyl-
propane unit,

KO -C-C-C
CH30

The side chain is frequently a glycerol unit, attached to another guaicyl unit
most probably at the beta-position,

and can be hydrolyzed by hot alkali to the acid.
