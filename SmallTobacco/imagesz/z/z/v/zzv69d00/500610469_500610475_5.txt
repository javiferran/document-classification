K. TOXICITY STUDIES ON ETHYLENEDIAMINETETRAACETIC ACID (EDTA)

Paper by Carl R, Fellers et al, of the University of Massachusetts

EDTA is a chelating agent that forms soluble, non-ionizing complexes
with many metallic ions, This paper reports the non-toxicity of this compound
when added, at a level of 1%, to the food given to rats for a period of 4
years, This study paves the way for the eventual clearance of EDTA for use
in foods and drugs. For example, traces of iron or copper that would impart
an objectionable taste to a beverage could be complexed and rendered taste-
less by the addition of EDTA,

L. MAPLE SYRUP. EFFECT OF CONTROLLED FERMENTATION OF MAPLE SAP ON
THE COLOR AND FLAVOR OF MAPLE SYRUP
Paper by Naghski, Reed and Willits of the Eastern Regional Research
Laborato

The best maple syrup has a light color and delicate maple flavor, and
ordinarily comes from sap gathered early in the season when the level of
bacteria is still low. It has generally been considered that the sap should be
handled under conditions as sterile as possible. The present study was made
to find which microorganisms are actually harmful,

In model experiments, various microorganisms were added to maple sap,
In some experiments, two types were added. About the most striking results
were obtained by yeast and by Pseudomonas 25. The yeast increased the color
and the acrid or "caramel flavor" of the final syrup, a result that is un-
desirable. The Pseudomonas actually increased the maple flavor with no
increase in color or in caramel flavor,
