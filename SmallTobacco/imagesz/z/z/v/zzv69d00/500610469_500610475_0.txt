Summa ry:

The author attended the 130th Meeting of the American Chemical Society

views, two plant tours, and from some of the papers is given in the body of
this report.

Memorandum:
A EMPLO CL H

Two job notices were posted at the Employment Clearing House for organic
and physical chemists to work on the isolation and identification of natural
products. Thirteen applicants signed these notices. Data on these applicants
and on about 30 other organic and physical chemists were brought back to our
laboratory for screening.

INTERVIEW WITH A STEROID S$ HEN

One of the men who signed our job notice was Dr. C. Chen, an Assistant
Professor of Biochemistry at Northwestern University School of Medicine. He
also called me at my hotel and we met and talked for an hour.

i}

Dr. Chen has published about 15 papers on natural products, especially
steroids. He is only partly inclined to leave his present connection, but
would be interested in tobacco research that utilized his knowledge of
steroids, He might engage in such research at Northwestern, either sponsored
or gratis.

Dr. Chen feels in particular that the steroids in tobacco should be
characterized, and an effort made to see whether they lead to carcinogenic
materials in tobacco smoke. Also, if any tobacco steroid qualifies as
starting material for a medicinal such as cortisone, the resulting publicity
would be of great value to the tobacco iniustry.

If Dr. Chen does not qualify for an opening in our laboratory, it is
suggested that he be referred to the Tobacco Industry Research Committee for
a possible research grant,
