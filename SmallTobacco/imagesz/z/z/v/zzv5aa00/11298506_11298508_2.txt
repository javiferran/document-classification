since this substance appears to have broad anti-carcinogenic action without
apparent toxicity. A recent clinical study by Zumoff et al. (reprint included )
has reconfirmed the observation that premenopausal women with primary breast
cancer have subnormal blood levels of DHEA and DHEA-sulfate. The authors of
this study, who have cited our observation that DHEA protects mice against
breast cancer, have recommended that we consider prophylactic trials with

OHEA in women at high risk for breast cancer.

Physicians at M.D. Anderson Hospital, with whom we have been in contact
over the past year, are anxious to undertake clinical trials. The subjects
to be tested might include women at high risk for breast cancer because of
family history as well as individuals with head or neck cancer who have been
heavy smokers and are at very high risk for primary Jung cancer.

I very much appreciate your interest and support in the development of
these clinical programs and do hope we will be able to proceed with the

necessary F.D.A. animal toxicology tests as quickly as possible.
