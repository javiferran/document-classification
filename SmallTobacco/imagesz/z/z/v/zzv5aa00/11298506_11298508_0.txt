Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfated congeners are naturally
occurring adrenal steroids in humans and represent, on a weight basis, the
bulk of all steroids, other than cholesterol, found in serum. Blood levels
of DHEA follow a rising-falling pattern which parallels mid-life vigor and
senescent decline.

Clinical studies have shown that women who excrete subnormal levels of
DHEA breakdown products in their urine are at high risk for developing |
breast cancer. Subsequent studies have also found that women with established
breast cancer have low blood levels of both DHEA and DHEA-sulfate.

The biological role of DHEA is not known. It was demonstrated over 20
years ago that DHEA is a potent inhibitor of glucose~6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
This enzyme controls a critical pathway in the metabolism of glucose which is
important in the synthesis of fat and for cell reproduction.

| Anti-Obesity Action

In 1977 Yen et al. found that DHEA treatment of a genetically obese strain .
of mouse prevented the development of obesity without suppressing appetite.
There was no apparent toxicity, and the anti-obesity effect was reversible upon
withdrawal of treatment. This may have been the first demonstration of a sub-
stance which reduces weight gain without affecting appetite. The authors
presented evidence that DHEA inhibited weight gain by reducing the activity of
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which resulted in an inhibition in fat
synthesis.
