points agreed on are as follows:

Make RL-59 at the Hopewell Processing Company before the
Thanksgiving Holidays. The time required for this run
should be at least one day. Two to three days may be
required to identify any processing problems. Material
generated during the last run is to be consumer tested
in HTI and RPS.

Cigarette test using HRL-59 will be as follows:
(a) RP?

October, 1975 controls for Marlboro, Benson § Hedges,
Virginia Slims, and Parliament are to be tested
against Y-76 cigarettes with HRL-59. Cigarette
samples are to be made and shipped in December so
that preliminary results can be evaluated in
early January.

(b) HTI Tests

The above cigarette types are to be tested in HTI.
Arrangements are to be made to use telephone
procedures by HTI so that the final results can be
obtained by February 1, 1976.
