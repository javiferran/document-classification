Leslie,
The five attached abstracts are respecttully submitted for the TSRC Editorial Committee's consideration.

The fifth abstract may, or may not, be appropriate for inclusion within the conference program. As we have discussed,
the authors of

these papers would like to use the first four time slots for presentation only, followed by a panel discussion with the
conference

attendees. It is possible that there will be very few questions from the floor (if recent conference history is an indication
vinat to expect), but perhaps such a format will stimulate discussion.

Thank-you for your kind consideration of this matter.

Mike <<2000MFB1.doc>> <<2000MFB2.doc>> <<2000MFB3.doc>> <<2000MFB4.doc>> <<2000MFB5.doc>>

PS - | will leave hard copies in your chair in a few minutes.
