These studies are not proceeding at the pace

envisioned at budget time, or are less costly
than estimated.

Comments.

Unfortunately, marketing plans change more rapidly than the

testing program. When a change is made in the form of an addition

or deletion, a delay or an acceleration, it has a major effect on

the numbers contained on the Budget. The backlog of work is sufficient
in the program so that when something is cancelled or delayed, some-
thing else necessary can be substituted. However, this shifting

of gears so to speak typically takes about 3 months since it is tied

in with contract laboratory staffing and space scheduling.
