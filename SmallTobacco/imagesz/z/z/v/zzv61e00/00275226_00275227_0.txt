Outside Testing Budget

At the end of April the "Outside Testing" budget was underspent

by $323,

327. The seven activities itemized below, totaling

$351,720, generally account for underspending.

i.

Drug Enzyme Makeup ($30,000)

There has been an unexpected delay at Borriston
Laboratories in implementing these tests on
schedule.

Immunosuppression Studies ($4,000)
Again, an unexpected delay at Borriston
in implementing scheduled tests.

- Absorption-Distribution ($32,000):

There was a one month administrative delay at
Research Triangle Institute as a new contract
was initiated. This was followed by a further

2 month delay at Borriston Laboratories. We

do not know if it is possible to make up for
lost time as these studies continue on a monthly
basis.

CNS Activity Development ($7,500):
This protocol development activity has not
been initiated because of other commitments.

      

 
  

Acute Oral, 14-Day Subchronic, 90-Day Subchronic ($26,400)
The test material (Dll, D12) was damaged in shipment.
Then, Product Development changed the formula because of
unanticipated problems with one of the ingredients. A
new formulation has not been devised. During May and
June budgeted charges amounting to $61,500 will not be
accrued.

      

Skin Painting and Condensate Collection ($97,500)
Mechanical equipment failure, technical delays, and
delays due to price negotiations prevented the current
study from starting as budgeted. In addition to the
above, an additional shortfall of $35,000 will be
incurred during May and June.
