SUBECT: FDA Regulation of Tobacco Products

Today President Clinton announced that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has issued regulations governing tobacco products, with the
stated purpose of reducing underage tobacco use. As you know, we firmly
believe that kids shouldn't smoke, and we're leading the industry in
preventing underage access to cigarettes.

On May 15, we proposed federal legislation that would make it
impossible for anyone to legally obtain tobacco products in the U.S. without a
face-to-face transaction where age can be verified. We believe a legislative
approach, which President Clinton has said he would prefer, would take us a
long way toward the goal we all share: a marketplace where kids cannot buy
cigarettes. We hope Congress will take up this issue soon.

The FDA's plan is wrong-headed. It's illegal. And we're going to fight
it with everything we've got. The agency claims it must seize control over
cigarette advertising, promotion and sales to prevent underage smoking. And
FDA Commissioner Kessler says that once his agency takes control of the
tobacco industry, it could ban cigarettes.

This Pandora's box of regulation flies in the face of the law, the facts,
history, common sense and public opinion. In our corner we have the U.S.
Constitution, recent decisions by the Supreme Court, Congressional history
and past statements by FDA commissioners. What's more, the vast majority
of Americans take our side on the central issues, including the right of adults
to make their own choices about whether to smoke and our right to market
our products to adults.

Our blueprint for legislation contains many of the same elements the
FDA has proposed. But under our plan, the FDA will be expressly forbidden
