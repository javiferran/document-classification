from regulating the sale or marketing of tobacco products. The FDA is the
wrong agency to lead the fight against underage smoking. It's a matter of
common sense that the FDA should not try to regulate cigarettes. Previous
commissioners concluded — unanimously — that the agency has no authority
to regulate the tobacco industry.

Over the past 80 years, Congress has repeatedly considered whether
the FDA should have the authority to regulate cigarettes. In each instance,
Congress has said no, and courts have agreed. This summer, the Supreme
Court reaffirmed the substantial First Amendment protection that applies to
advertising, yet the FDA proposes to place unreasonable and unconstitutional
restrictions on our cigarette advertising to adult smokers.

It won't wash. We have a right to market cigarettes to adults.
President Clinton has said so repeatedly, and the public agrees.

When the FDA announced its plan last year, we joined several other
tobacco manufacturers and a North Carolina advertising firm to bring suit
against the agency. Advertising and retailer associations have brought suits
of their own. Today we amended our complaint, and we hope the judge will
address the case soon. In the meantime, we will pursue our legislative
proposal, mobilize our forces and join with our allies to fight the FDA's illegal

power grab.

Our critics may claim victory, but this is just another bump in the
rough road of the tobacco business. Our company is stronger today than it's
ever been. In product after product, we continue to add value. In market

after market, we continue to make gains.

Let's keep doing what we know is right, and we'll keep winning.
