PROJECT TITLE 3 SAVOURY

PERIOD: COVERED: : NOVEMBER 1982: - JANUARY 1983
WRITTEN BY 3 Zuber-J. (JAZ)

OBJECTIVES

Amino acid mixtures obtained by hydrolysis. of yeast (Ninomass,
Learmass, etc.) are reacted with sugar (Maillard reaction) so
as: to give: a flavouriing formulation.. The latter will be used
on: tobacco: which is: in the form of strips, cut filler, stems
etc. in order to up-grade tobacco lacking Burley taste
character.

STATUS

i. Cigarettes

The PME Leaf Department wishes to determine the degree to

which cooked flavours can. reinforce the Burley taste of

Burley substitutes. It was decided (1): to work with two

test cigarettes having the same: blend which differs from

the MLF blend in the proportion of substitute. Although

the two test cigarettes have the same: blend, the substitute

is treated differently in each case. For cigarette 1, the suk -
stitute undergoes the Burley treatment of standard MLF wnereas in
cigarette 2, it is only humidified.

2. Maillard Reaction

OSTSE98z0>

We wish to reduce: the time of Maillard reaction between the
yeast hydrolysates and the sugars (5 days at 909Â°C and 453

HO for the best flavour yet obtained (2)). As it is. known
that it is possible to vary considerably the reaction rate
by modifying the water content, two cooked. flavours. were
