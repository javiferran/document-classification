identify relatives at high risk of coronary artery disease
(CAD). It was thought that certain risk factors might be
inherited (e.g. elevated blood cholesterol, hypertension,
diabetes) and other risk factors might be learned (é.g.
smoking).

Detailed family histories were obtained from 577 white men who
underwent coronary angiography. According to the findings,
only in men under 50 years of age did diseased men have more
frequent family histories of disease than did disease-free
men, Family history was not associated with disease in men 50
years or older. However, more diseased than non-diseased men
had both a positive family history and a history of a relative
dying suddenly of coronary disease.

Richard Grimm, Minneapolis, reported on a mail survey of
physicians in four Midwestern towns. The following attitudes
about heart disease prevention were disclosed:

1) Risk factors cited in order of decreasing importance were
blood pressure, heredity, and smoking;

2) Weight, stress and diet were seen as less important;

3) Physicians felt they were most effective in treating
blood pressure and much less so in influencing patients’
diet, exercise, and smoking habits;

4) Direct advice was considered as having a moderate to
large impact on helping patients stop smoking.
