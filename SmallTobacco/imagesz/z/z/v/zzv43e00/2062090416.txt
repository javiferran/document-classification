The objective of the present study was to determine the in vitro
sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and chromosome aberration (CA)-
inducing activities of the diluted MAINSTREAM and SIDESTREAM WHOLE
SMOKE (MWS, SWS) of the research cigarette types SIRIUS-A and -B, A.

The research cigarette types SIRIUS-A and -B, both filter
cigarettes, differed in the concentrations of individual humec-
tants in the filler. SIRIUS-A contained 1.9 percent glycerol,
1.4 percent propylene glycol, and 0.8 percent triethylene glycol.
SIRIUS-B contained 2.3 percent glycerol, 1.7 percent propylene
glycol, and no triethylene glycol. The total humectant concentra-
tion in the filler of both research cigarette types waS approx.
4 percent. The standard reference cigarette 2R1 was used as an in-

ternal control.

3 METHOD

The study was performed according to INBIFO standard operating
procedures. Three MWS and 3 SWS doses were administered. For MWS,
the doses were between 0.2 and 1.0 "milligrams" TPM per flask and
for SWS between 0.1 and 0.6 "milligrams" TPM per flask. There were

4 cultures per dose group.
