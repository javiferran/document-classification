HUMAN DILUTION MEASUREMENTS WITH VARYING LENGTHS OF CIGARETTES
EXTENDING FROM PUFF PROFILE ANALYZER HOLDER

,

Filter dilution determinations using the Puff Parameter
Analyzer (PPA) were made on Barclay-type cigarettes! for each
of 45 human smokers. For each subject, the filter dilution was
determined using three methods: (a) 10 mm of filter available
for the smoker, (b) 15 mm of filter available for the smoker,
and (c) cigarette smoked with a plastic tip to prevent any
occlusion or crushing of the grooves. The objective was to
determine whether there was a consistent difference in the
reduction of filter dilution observed between having 10 or 15
millimeters of filter available to the smoker. This was
prompted by the fact that the glass: holder for the PPA leaves
10 mm of the cigarette filter exposed to the smoker which could

force the smoker to alter his puffing pattern.

The results, presented in Table 1, show that the test with
10 mm of filter available had an average dilution reduced to
32% with a standard deviation of 12%, while the test with 15 mm
of filter available had an average dilution reduced to 37% with
a standard deviation of 13%. While the difference between the
two methods is statistically significant, the magnitudes of the

reduction are of the same order using either method.

â€˜Cigarettes with grooved filters and non-porous plugwrap were
made with the perforations located 17 millimeters from the
mouth end specifically for this test.
