The quantity Ee may be related to pressure drop by the
following expression

in {1-E

s) ~~ RP AB

Vv

where A is the cross sectional area of the filter tip, V

the air velocity and B a constant characteristic of the filter
material. For most commercial filters A has a value of approxi-
mately .502 cm.” and V is 17.5 cm.”/sec. Using these values

and converting to the base 10, the expression becomes

log (1-E,) = -.0125 B
AP

The greater the value of B, the better the filter. Fordyce
et al., Tob. Sci. V 70 (1961) have shown experimentally that
this expression is valid for the range of pressure drop and
materials which are used to make commercial filters. rc

Values of B, called Sigma by Fordyce, range from 2.0 for a
5-denier cellulose acetate filter to 5.4 for a paper filter.
Using smaller denier acetate fibers of about 2 denier, it is
possible to obtain B values of 3 or even greater (3.5) by
incorporating finely Givided additives. Although paper filters
have limited commercial acceptance, specially designed cellu-
lose filters have demonstrated B values in excess of 6.5.

Using the range of B values of 2.0 for‘a poor acetate filter
to 6.0 for a superior paper filter, one may calculate a
practical range of E, for filters of the same pressure drop.
USing a pressure drop of 6.0 cm. of H,O, which is easily
within the commercial range, the obtainable efficiency range
is estimated as .29 to .64.

From this discussfYon, it should be clear that any filter
material evaluation must involve both pressure drop and
efficiency measurements. If two filters are compared at
equal pressure drop, circumference and length, at several
different points, values of B can be computed and valid
eomparisons made.
