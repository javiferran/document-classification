CIGARETTE SMOKE FILTRATION

AND EVALUATION OF FILTERS

The measurement of two baSic parameters is required to
evaluate a candidate filter for nonselective filtration
properties of the smoke aerosol. The accepted means of
measuring these two parameters is discussed below, and
some representative data pertaining to commercial and
experimental cigarette filters are discussed.

Pressure drop is that quantity obtained when the pressure
differential between two points is determined. In the
case of cigarette filters, it is the pressure difference
between the two ends of the filter at a normal air flow
of 17.5 cc./fsec. at IS°R. and 1 atmosphere. The pressure
difference is usually expressed in centimeters or inches
of water. Most filter tips in use fall within the range
of 2.0-12.0 cm. of HO. ‘
Efficiency of a cigarette filter is a measure of the
fraction of smoke retained by the filter. If we use

the notation S, to represent the smoke presented to

the filter, and S, the smoke passing the filter, the’
efficiency (Ee) may be expressed as

e

S, may be measured by smoking cigarettes under standard
conditions (35 ec puff, 2-scecond duration, leminute frequency,
at 75°F and 60% relative humidity) and obtaining the dry TPM
yield according to the procedure employed by the FTC. 5S, is
measuxed on cigarettes smoked to the same butt length as for Sy
put with the filter matexial removed from the tip.
