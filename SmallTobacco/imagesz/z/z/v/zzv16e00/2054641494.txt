+ RECORDS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM PROCEDURES

The attached procedures have been developed for the inventory and maintenance of
records for your functional area. The procedures have been reviewed and
endorsed by the Records Management Joint Task Force, the Philip Morris USA Legal
Department, and the law firm of Hunton and Williams. The implementation of
these procedures is dependent upon the Records Management Inventory System being
fully operational. According to the Information Services Department, the system
will be fully operational by December 31, 1990.

The procedures are in compliance with the Philip Morris USA Records Management
Manual with one exception. The Philip Morris USA Records Management Manual
states that Disposal Notices are signed by functional heads, whereas these
procedures indicate that Disposal Notices are signed by department managers.

The Philip Morris USA Records Management Manual will be revised to indicate that
this is the responsibility of department managers.

It has been recommended to the Records Management Joint Task Force that these
procedures be included in the Philip Morris USA Records Management Manual as an
appendix, and a decision on this matter is pending.

These procedures should prove to be highly beneficial in assuring that your
department's records are managed in accordance with the Philip Morris USA
Records Management Program, and it is anticipated that you will realize greater
efficiency in managing records upon implementation of these procedures.

If you have any questions or require interpretation of these procedures, please
contact me at extension 5349,
