At this point in time, we know very fittle about the FTC's ‘non-public investigation".
RJR's responses to tha agency's inquiry will be protected from public disclosure, but some
documents could ultimately become public Information if the agency decides to open a formal
investigation. :

We will be meeting with the FTC's staff over the next several weeks in an effort to
narrow the scope of the investigation and reach agreement on the types of documents that we
will disclose to the agency. Until these and other issues are clarified with the FTC, we must
interpret our document retention obligations very broadly so as not to inadvertently destroy any
price or competition related documents. The term “document” includes drafts, non-identical
copies and electronic information such as e-mail. :

We should keep the existence of the FTC's inquiry confidential and not discuss it with
persons outside the company.

“ Peter H, Ramm
