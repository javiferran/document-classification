Chartes Loloma, an eccentric, high-
living Hopi Indian, is either the world’s
most sophisticated primitive artist

or vice versa. “Loloma’s jewelry is
some of the best being made—any-
where,” judges Evan Maurer, curator
of primitive art at Chicago’s Art Insti-
tute. “But as a curator | can't afford

the stuff.” At his crowded gallery open-
ings in Chicago, New York and Paris,
the pony-tailed Lotoma soaks up the
compliments and disposable income of
a chic clientele that spends up to
$12,000 for his theatrical bracelets and
rings. Many have interiors lined with ex-
quisite stones and work of which only
the owner is aware. ‘My jewelry is like
a woman who takes off her gown to
reveal her beauty,” he announces,
martiniin hand. But beneath Loloma’s
expansive public manner is a mystical
and committed artist.

To stay in touch with the roots of his
work, the 57-year-old Loloma leads a
jarringly schizophrenic life. Weekends
he plays in the superrich resort of
Scottsdale, Ariz., partying out of his
luxurious adobe hacienda complete
with freestanding fireplace, pool
and sunken tub. He wears Ultrasuede
Jackets and an $8,500 Philippe Patek
watch. The gearshift of his Jag XK-E is
studded with silver and turquoise nug-
gets. His other transportation includes a
Rolls Silver Cloud, a six-seater Piper
Cherokee, a twin-engine Beechcraft
Air Queen plus a co-owned Boeing
biplane. After his cat, Spunky, broke
her teeth falling off the Jag, Loloma
had them capped in gold.

But between weekends Loloma the
Artist is in residence on a rocky bluff
called the Third Mesa, six hours’ drive
due north. It is the settlement where
he was born and where more than 7,000
Hopi tribesmen still subsist after cen-
turies raising corn. Loloma bunks ina
rambling house with no running

on the mesa Loloma lives by the Hopi

a poor farmer but a gifted weaver. “My

“All Hopis are artists,” he declares.
“We are raised on it—theater, songs,
making instruments. But we never
called it art—it was just part of life.” Lo-

was 7,” he says. By the time he was 18
he was skilled enough to become an
assistant to famed Indian muralist Fred
Kabotie. Then, after World War Il ser-
vice as a noncom camouflage expert
in the Aleutians, Loloma married a
talented Indian potter, Otellie Pasiva-
ya, and switched to pottery. They won
fellowships, taught on the reservation
and together developed Lolomaware, a
distinctive and lucrative line of earth-
en dishes. (He and Otellie were
divorced in 1965.)

Eventually Loloma turned to jewelry-
making and to his own updating of Hopi
tradition. His advanced, innovative
work was at first rejected as un-indian
by native arbiters because Loloma in-
sisted on adding such unconventional
materials as gold and serpentine to
the historic silver, turquoise and coral.
Today Loloma has both converted the
