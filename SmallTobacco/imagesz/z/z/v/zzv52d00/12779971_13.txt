PPG just lowered the cost
ofa heat wave.

Solar screens made with PPG
fiber glass yarn block as much as
70 percent of the sun's heat and
glare before either reaches a

window. Years of successful com- ~

mercial use mean homes across
America can now wear efficient
solar s¢réens, too.
Reducing your air conditioning
bili is only one of the capabilities
of fiber glass. Its rapid emergence
as a major component in the auto-
motive, tire, textile and construction
industries surprises no one at PPG.
After 25 years of hard work,

PPG today ranks as both a leading
producer and research pioneer of
fiber glass. In fact, PPG's research
is a considered investment that is
continually paying off with new
uses for fiber glass. And does it sur-
prise you that solar screens save
money in winter by holding heat in?

At PPG we constantly strive to
improve the products we know
best, to make them better, safer
and easier to use.

Logical product development
remains basic to PPG’s way of
doing business in chemicals, glass,

coatings and resins, and fiber glass.
For a multi-industry company, It's
a great way to grow.
