PHILIP MORRIS U.S. A.

INFER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE
Richmond, Virginia

To: Dr, C. L. Ellis \\

From: A. L Goldsmith

Date: November 21, 1997

Subject: Specific examples of overseas research

Attached you will find a table of American companies and foreign countries in which they have
research and development facilities [¢f memo of Nov. 17]. The information comes from the D&B —
INTERNATIONAL DUN’S MARKET IDENTIFIERS {DIALOG: File 518} database, and the particular loca-
tions were identified by selecting entries whose primary or secondary Standard Industrial Classification
Code(s) included 8731 (Commercial physical research), 8732 (Commercial nonphysica! research), or
8733 (Noncommercial research organization), with an ultimate parent company in the United States.
The tabular format was chosen since it is a convenient method of answesing the specific question of
where else U.S. companies conduct research. It must be pointed out that the methods Dun & Brad-
street uses to define and index locations keep certain facilities off the list; for instance, the IBM Zurich
Research Laboratory is not found in this particular database. However, the appearance of Philip Morris
in the list demonstrates that this strategy is valid for obtaining comparative examples. If I can be of

any further assistance, please feel free to call me at ext. 5352.
