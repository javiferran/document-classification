BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) --- Mario Andretti
stole the show Saturday in time trials for Sun-
day’s Marlboro 500, turning the fastest qualify-
ing lap'in motorsports history.

The 53-year-old Andretti took the pole posi-
tion for the 500-mile race with a blazing lap of
234,275 mph on a virtually perfect day at
Michigan International Speedway.

Andretti’s effort knocked Newman-Haas
Racing teammate Nigel Mansell’s 233.462 out
of the top spot and was considerably quicker
than the 232.618 lap by Roberto Guerrero in
1992 at Indianapuus that had stood as the
fastest official qualifying lap until Saturday.

The record-smashing lap on the bumpy 2-
mile, high-banked oval was not quite as quick
as the hand-timed unofficial Indy-car closed-
course record of 234.5 set by Jeff Andretti, the

eryone was running a little faster than this
morning (in practice), so I just held my breath
and went for it.

“The track was great,” he added, “The only
thing that would have made it better is if it
had been overcast.”

Mansell already had qualified on the warm,
calm and sunny afternoon, breaking Andretti's
track qualifying mark of 230.150, set last year.
So Andretti, who upped his Indy-car record to
66 career poles, knew he had his work cut out
for him.

“I attacked the track from the word go,” the
four-time series champion said. “We needed
to build momentum and reach the speed.”
