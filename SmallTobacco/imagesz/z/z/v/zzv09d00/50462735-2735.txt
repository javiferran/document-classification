Dear Harmon

I enclose the competitive renewal application for our grant entitled “The
pharmacogenetics of lung cancer”. The following points may be of
assistance to the reviewers:

(i) The Progress Report shows that the recruitment of patients in Los
Angeles is almost complete. If we have finished the CYP2D6
genotyping assays prior to the next SAB meeting, I shall
communicate the outcome to you by letter.

(ii) Dr Daly and I have established the Newcastle group, with your
support, in a leading position in the new and emergent field of
molecular epidemiology. As such, I have been invited to speak on
this work at the U.S.-Japan cancer meeting in Hawaii in February,
the Japan cancer meeting in Sapporo in July, together with three
other international meetings in 1994 in Toronto, Istanbul and North
Carolina. Clearly we wish to maintain our leading and influential
position in the field and thus renewal of our CTR grant, which is
central to our activities, is a matter of high priority for us.

(iii) We have been able to trim our expected budget to around the
$80,000 p.a. level because of the fall in the value of Sterling.

With kind regards.

Yours sincerely
