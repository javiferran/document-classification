Budget tracker from Tamara (newly married 1 guess from the name
change!!), tells

me the BMSG Budget is $1,291,800 with Fees of $577,500 and OOP
Expenses of

$714,300.

Budget tracker from Courtney tells me the same BSMG Budget is
$1,266,400 with
Fees of $577,500 and OOP Expenses of $688,000.

T know the BSMG Budget had some adjustments and I was using the
$1,266,400 as

the new basis for the BSMG Budget.

You should know what my question is!!!!

Also, everyone needs to be on the same page or chart as we rapidly
approach

year-end for final budget amounts.

Please advise.
