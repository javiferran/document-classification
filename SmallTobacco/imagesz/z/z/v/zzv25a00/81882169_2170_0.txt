Jordan, attached please find two files now in agreement:

1) 2001 Budget (all charts issued monthly via Bozell)
2) TRAC0901 (monthly tracker from Weber Shandwick)

Per Sheldon's question, the correct PR budget is $1,266,400 with Fees of $577,500 and
OOP Expenses of $688,000.

The discrepancy stemmed from the $25,400 transfered from PR to Advertising to fund an
incremental page in family Life, supporting the Popkin Tour. This adjustment had not
yet been reflected in the WS tracker and was mis-allocated on the Bozell chart. The
charts are now in agreement.

Please don't hesitate to contact us with any further questions.

Many thanks,
Adam

Just need a quick answer on this. This refers to the 2000 budget year, and
the

two trackers which feature differing amounts. Please reply today if
possible so

I can get back to good old Sheldon (we can't get anything past him, can
we?)

Treceived your package of goodies this morning. In reviewing the charts

and

things, I noticed that I have 2 trackers for BSMG Chicago. Both trackers
have

different budget numbers and T hope you can shed some light on the
problem.

Here's the scenario:
