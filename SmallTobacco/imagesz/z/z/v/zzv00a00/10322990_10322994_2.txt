determined by suspending the powdered protein in a toluene-gel
scintillator. .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION ‘

An attempt is made in this study to follow the reparative

process in cardiac muscle, following myocardial infarction, as

connective tissue replaces the necrotic muscle.
Table I shows the specific activity of protein fractions from

normal and infarcted tissue two days after infarction. The greatest

increase in incorporation is observed in nuclear ribosomes, cyto-

plasmic microsomes and mitochondria, whereas there is subnormal 4in-

corporation into Nyy fraction, containing contractile proteins.

Table Il illustrates the specific activity of some nucleic
acid fractions and the increased activity in the infarcted tissue.
Of particular interest is the marked difference in specific activity »

of “nucleolar-RNA" (p-RNA) and "messenger-RNA” (m-RNA). 7
