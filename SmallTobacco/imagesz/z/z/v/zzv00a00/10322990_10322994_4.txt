Thede data seem to indicate that immediately following infarction

and destzuction of myocardial tissue there is a rapid response and
renewal of cell material replacing the necrotic muscle. The early
renewal of cell material was further indicated by the incorporation
of giycine-ci4 into nucleic acids of the infarcted tissue (Fig. 2).
{he earliest and greatest increase in incorporation was observed in
“nucleolar” or p-RNA, followed by nuclear ribosomal RNA. DNA shows
an increase in activity 48 bours after infarction, which coincides
with the appearance of new fibroblasts. The first step in the
reparative process seems to be synthesis of nuclear material,
followed by reconstruction of mitochondria and microsomes. ‘The
chronological order of lsbeling indicates the nuclear origin of

cytoplasmic particles, and emphasizes the early increase in labeling

of nuclear ribosomes.
