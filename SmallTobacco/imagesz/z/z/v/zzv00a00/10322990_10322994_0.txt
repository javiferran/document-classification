The role of cytoplasmic ribosomes in protein synthesis has been
studied extensively in the past; more recent discoveries suggest
(NolLA et al, 1963) that the functional units or protein synthesis are
ribosomal aggregates, "ergosomes", consisting of particles held
together by m-RNA. The origin of cytoplasmic ribosomes is a matter of
some speculation but a current favorite is thet ribosomal RNA is
synthesized in the nucleus.

The purpose of our report is to present some data which
indicate that nuclear ribosomes are labeled earlier than cytoplasmic
microsomes during tissue reparation, suggesting nuclear origin of the
cytoplasmic microsomes. The studies were carried out on subcellular
fractions of infarcted and normal cardiac muscle.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Myocardial infarction was produced in dogs by ligation of

branches of the anterior descending coronary artery, so that a homo~-
geneous infarct was obtained.
Glycine-2-cl4 (specific activity 15.1 mc/mMol) was injected

intravenously, 30 gic per kg body weight. The animals were sacrificed
