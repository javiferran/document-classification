Minnesota--The Minnesota ASSIST Project has awarded 25 community
organizations in the state with grants of up to $30,000 each to fund projects
aimed at reducing smoking. Sixteen are current grantees. Nine are new
recipients. Among the possible projects, the organizations will be promoting
stricter local tobacco retailing regulations, particularly tobacco

advertising rules. One of the group's goal is to lower Minnesota's smoking rate to
under 15 percent by 2000.

Yarmouth, MA--The chamber and restaurant leaders met yesterday and
decided to come up with an alternative proposal to a complete ban which would
involve the 6-foot rule, barriers and ventilation systems. The word is a
complete ban is on the minds of the board of health. On 8/25, there will be

a big demonstration by seven filtration companies.
