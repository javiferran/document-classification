*WT 1 to 6, WT B95-8 strain transformed LCL controls for the ES1
to -11 LCLs (Fig. 1); WT7 to -11, P3HR1 strain transformed LCL
controls for the 26081 to -10 LCLs (Fig. 1); WT12 to-15, WT P3HR1
control LCLs for the 19S1 to -6 LCLs (Fig. 1).

tPercentage of cells responding to anti-immunoglobulin treatment as
monitored by flow cytometry of indo-1-loaded cells was determined
as described (25).

Percentage of change in intracellular calcium level was determined
by comparing mean fluorescence of ceils before and after antibody
treatment (25).

§slg levels were determined by direct immunofluorescence staining
of live cells with goat anti-human immunoglobulin antibody (25).
Average mean fluorescence of 5000 cells is indicated. Immuno-
globulin isotype was determined by staining as described above
with isotype-specific antibodies for IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE,
and the isotype is indicated by the corresponding Greek letter,
Average background mean fluorescence of LCLs processed for
flow cytometry analysis in the absence of primary antibody was
5.

The observed differences in anti-immunoglobulin-mediated
calcium mobilization was not dependent on the isotype or
relative abundance of sig (Table 1). Most LCLs obtained after
infection with WT or LMP2 mutant EBV recombinants were
both Igy. and Igé positive. A few LCLs were Igy, Igy, or Iga

positive. All LCLs expressed immunoglobulin at levels sub-
stantially above background (average mean fluorescence, 23—
316 versus a background of 5), As previously observed when
LMP2A was expressed in EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma
cells, WT infected LCLs tended to express lower levels of slg
than LMP2 mutant recombinant-infected LCLs (Table 1) (25).
However, even when matched for slg isotype and abundance,
WT infected LCLs differed dramatically from LMP2 mutant
recombinants in response to anti-immunoglobulin. For exam-
ple, although WT13 and ES4 expressed both Igy: and Ig8 with
similar abundance (average mean fluorescence 73 versus 77),
only 24% of WT13 cells responded to anti-immunoglobulin
treatment with only a 40% change in intracellular free calcium,
whereas 76% of the ES4 cells responded with a 130% change
in intracellular free calcium (Table 1).

LMP2 Blacks Surface Immunoglobulin-Induced Activation
of Lytic EBV Infection in WT LCLs. To determine whether
LMP2A expression modulates tne immunoglobulin-mediated
switch from latent to lytic infection, 17 WT and 16 ES
recombinant EBV-infected LCLs were analyzed for sponta-
neous and anti-immmunoglobulin-induced expression of Z, the
BZLF1 immediate-early gene product, by immunoblotting.
Six of 17 WT LCLs and 16/16 ES LCLs were nonpermissive
for spontaneous Z expression, whereas 11/17 WT LCLs had
a low level of spontaneous permissivity. After 48 hr of
anti-immunoglobulin stimulation, only 4/17 WT LCLs
showed any increase in Z protein levels after slg crosslinking.
In sharp contrast, 14/16 ES LCLs had substantial increases
in Z expression after anti-immunoglobulin treatment.

Representative data are shown with five wild-type and five
ES LMP? recombinant-infected LCLs, which were matched
in having very little or no spontaneous permissivity for lytic
EBY infection. The Akata cells were a positive control for a
cell line that exhibits an increase in lytic EBY infection after
slg crosslinking (22, 23). Akata cells were moderately per-
missive for spontancous EBV replication and were substan-
tially more permissive after anti-immunoglobulin crosslink-
ing, as monitored by immunoblot with monoclonal antibody
to the BZLF1 immediate-early gene product or with human
antisera to EBV lytic cycle proteins, which include early
replicative proteins (EA) (Fig. 3 Left). In contrast, the WT
LCLs repeatedly yielded very little or no induction of Z or
other replicative cycle EBV proteins after sIg crosslinking
(Fig. 3 Left). In the experiment presented in Fig. 3, two WT
EBV-infected LCLs, WT10 and WT6, had minimal sponta-
neous Z expression and minimal Z induction upon anti-
immunoglobulin treatment. In other experiments, the WT10
and WT6 cell lines tad no spontaneous permissivity and no
response to slg crosslinking. The five ES LCLs had no
spontaneous Z or EA expression, whereas both Z and EA
proteins were significantly induced after anti-immunoglobu-
lin treatment (Fig. 3 Right).

Immunofluores¢ence microscopy confirmed the absence
of Z protein expression in the five ES cell lines before
anti-immunogiobulin treatment, and in three of the five WT
LCLs before and after anti-immunoglobulin treatment (data
not shown). For the five ES LCLs, between 2% and 10% of
the cells were brightly positive for Z protein after anti-
immunoglobulin treatment. WT10 and WT6 were the only
WT LCLs among the five WT EBV-infected controls for
which, in some experiments, 0.5~1% of the cells were faintly
positive for spontaneous Z protein expression, and 2-3% of
the cells were faintly to moderately positive for Z staining
after anti-immunoglobulin stimulation. Immunofluorescence
for the gp110 late lytic cycle EBV protein was essentially
negative in all WT 1.CLs that had been induced with anti-
immunoglobulin, while induced ES LCLs were positive for
gp110 expression in 2-6% of the cells.
