Flow Cytometry, Immunofluorescence, and Calcium Analy-
sis. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-
human immunoglobulin, IgM, gD, IgG, unconjugated mouse
anti-human IgA and IgE antibodies (Southern Biotechnology
Associates), and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Jack-
son Immunologicals) were used to determine slg levels and
isotypes by flow cytometric analysis as described (25). Mono-
clonal antibodies to the BZLF1 (Z) immediate-early gene
product or BALF3 (gp110) late viral protein were used in
immunofluorescence assays (29, 30). Texas Red-conjugated
rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunologicals) was used as
asecondary antibody at 1:1000 for immunofluorescence. Indo-
1-loaded cells were stimulated with goat anti-human immuno-
globulin and intracellular calcium levels were monitored as
described (25).

EBV Activation Assays. Logarithmically growing cells were
washed and resuspended in fresh complete growth medium
with F(ab’), goat anti-human immunoglobulin (100 g/ml)
(Jackson Immunologicals), or with 7.5 pM calcium ionophore
A23187 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (20 ng/
mil) (Sigma).

RESULTS

LMP? Blocks sIg-Mediated Calcium Mobilization in EBV
Growth-Transformed LCLs. To assess the effect of LMP? on
immunoglobulin receptor signaling in latently EBV-infected
LCLs, we have used a series of cell lines that were growth
transformed in parallel by either WT or LMP2-mutated
recombinant EBV. EBV recombinants with three different
LMP? mutations were compared to their WT controls (Figs.
land 2). 19S EBY recombinants express LMP2B but do not
express LMP2A with its unique N-terminal cytoplasmic
domain due to a stop codon placed after the first 19 codons
of LMP2A (27). ES EBV recombinants have a 643-bp dele-
tion that results in expression of the N-terminal cytoplasmic
domain without any transmembrane domains (13). LMP2
crossreactive protein is not detectable in ES-infected cells,
probably due to instability. 260S EBV recombinants express
LMP?A and LMP2B proteins, which are truncated after the
fifth transmembrane domain due to the insertion of a stop
codon after codon 260 of LMP2A (28). 19S, 2605, and the
corresponding WT recombinants were constructed from the
P3HR1 EBV strain, whereas the ES recombinant and corre-
sponding WT were from the B95-8 EBV strain (13, 27, 28,
33-35). The EBV recombinants are similar to their WT
controls in infection and growth transformation of primary B
lymphocytes and in lytic replication after transfection of

binant EBV (WT = WT2, ES = ESS, 19S = 1953, and 260S = 260S1
in Table 1). (Insets) LLMP2 proteins expressed in each type of LCL.
Cells were loaded with 1 uM indo-l, the calcium-sensitive dye
(Molecular Probes), stimulated with 15 pg of goat anti-human
immunoglobulin antibody per ml, and analyzed by flow cytometry,
which monitors calcium mobilization by changes in the ratio of violet
to blue (405 to 485 nm) fluorescence of cells (y axis) over time (x axis)
(25), Baseline calcium levels were established for 30 sec before
addition of the goat anti-human immunoglobulin antibody (indicated
by a break in the histograms). At each time point, the violet/blue
ratio distribution among ~6000 cells is indicated by the vertical
pattern distribution along the y axis, where the number of cells at a
given violet/blue ratio is indicated by the pattern inteasity.

latently infected cells with an expression vector for the EBV
BZLF1 immediate-early gene product (13, 27, 28).

Human B lymphocytes transformed by LMP?-mutated
EBV recombinants or WT controls were loaded with the
calcium sensitive dye indo-l. After treatment with anti-
immunoglobulin antibodies, their intracellular free calcium
levels were monitored by flow cytometry. Representative
histograms for each type of EBV-infected LCLs are shown in
Fig. 2. With WT LMP2-infected LCLs, the intracellular free
calcium levels did not change in most cells (represented by
the darkest pattern in the WT histogram; Fig. 2). In contrast,
with ES and 19S L.MP2-mutated EBV-infected LCLs, most
cells responded to anti-immunoglobulin treatment with large
increases in intracellular free calcium that were rapid and
transient, as would be expected for normal human B lym-
phocytes (Fig. 2. HS and 19S). The 260$ LMP2 mutated
EBV-infected LCLs also responded to slg crosslinking with
rapid and transient increases in intracellular free calcium.
However, fewer cells responded and the magnitudes of the
responses were less than those observed in 19S and ES LCLs
(Fig. 2, 2608).

For each anti-immunoglobulin experiment, the percentage
of cells responding to antibody treatment with a change in
intracellular calcium, and the percentage change in intracel-
lular calcium ievels among those cells at the point of maximal
change, were determined (T: ‘able 1). WI LMP2 LCL re-
sponses to anti-immunoglobulin were reduced both in the
number of responding cells and in the magnitude of the
change in calcium level in those cells, particularly when
compared to the LMP2 mutant-infected LCLs. On average,
only 16% of WT infected cells responded, and of those cells
that responded there was an average 24% change in intra-
cellular free calcium. In marked contrast, an average of 75%
of the ES or 19S infected cells responded with a 157% average
change in intracellular free calcium. The 2608 LCLs clearly
responded with calcium mobilizations that were intermediate
between WT and ES or 19S LCLs. An average of 57% of the
260S infected cells responded with a 115% average change in
intracellular calcium.
