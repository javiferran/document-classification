Dear Carl:

We've received your letters and agree with you concerning the ee
numerical errors you have detected. We are working hard on the important -
and thought-provoking criticism you raised concerning the interpretation.

of the results of controlling for smoking: quantity > and - will be back in

touch with you shortly about this.

@ Vince Lisanti was here last week and I did tell him that the nénuseript
would not be ready by July. ce

I'm sorry that June and July are out of the question for your next visit
here, but hope that the earlier week in August might be feasible. Mean-
while, I expect we will be able to work out some of our disagreements by
letter and phone.

With best regards.
. , . Sincerely,
c
