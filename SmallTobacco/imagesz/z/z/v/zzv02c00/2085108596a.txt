Subject: YSP Article - Implications Brainstorming Meeting

Hi All-

As most of you know, we have been working with Danny Ennis on writing an article for publication based on an analysis of
TABS data.

We would like to invite you to help us brainstorm on the implications of the study. We plan to present the objectives and
results of the analysis to you, then we will generate a discussion on the implications.

We have scheduled the meeting for Wednesday, August {st from 10-11:30am in 4A. Please confirm your attendance.

Thanks.
