Smoking and! Health Issues Committee

I am delighted to report that Dr. Bern Dryer of Medex
International has agreed to work with us. He and! his
group: have done a considerable amount of thinking fol-
lowing my first meeting with them. They have: reviewed
the smoker/non-smoker literature (White-Froeb, Hirayama,
Trichopoulos, et al), and are eager to start on some:
short and long range programming.

Our next meeting is on Friday, May 8th, in the Byram,
Connecticut office of Medex. At that time, they. will
have a working contract and plan, and we will discuss
next steps.

If any of you would like to join us--I would, of course,
welcome it.

James C. Bowling
