This possibility unfortunately requires a stretch in believing
that the True brand is disproportionately affected: by this
possible phenomenon.

A more likely proposition is that we are being adversely affected
by competitive pressure and lack of support for our brand.

Consumer contacts from the Denver lead market area have ceased
some time back. There is no indication (from our consumer
contacts) that consumer dissatisfaction over the product changes
in True is particularly severe in this market. See attached
graphs for visual depiction of the share trends discussed above.

MILWAUKEE

Audit panel share reports in this, our "control" market (no Laser
True advertising; Laser product introduced only recently - mid
March '84) also reflect a long term slowly declining share trend
for the brand. *:

Fluctuating individual bi-weekly share reports are uncharacter-
istic of what has been observed in Phoenix and Denver where share
change trends are essentially flat curves.

We continue to investigate why this market has evidenced such
fluctuations. Areas being probed include evaluation of
competitive activity, re-examination of the store list
composition, etc.

CONCLUSIONS

The objective of monitoring store audit panels in Laser lead

Market areas, to detect a possible sales "disaster" resulting from

our new product and advertising has been accomplished.

No "disaster" traceable to the introduction of Laser True product
seems imminent.

-Given long term share trends. and the general lack of
marketing support behind True (Dec. '83 - present) declining
share trends in our Laser lead markets cannot be traced to
either Laser product and/or Laser advertising.

-Consumer contacts in those lead market areas (unsolicited
letters, AAU Study, product acceptance research) likewise
show no imminent disaster.
