SUBJECT: True - Laser True Lead Market Store Audit Data Update

This is to provide most recent data on Laser True "Disaster
Check" lead market store audit reports.

 

SUMMARY

Both lead market cities (Denver & Phoenix) which have received
Laser True advertising support evidence continuation of long term
share erosion trends. oe,

In neither case can the decline be clearly attributed to the
introduction of Laser True product and/or Laser True advertising.

Our conclusion then is that the store audit reports have served
their intended purpose as a diagnostic tool to help detect a
potential sales "disaster" (which does not seem to exist) and can

â€œnow be discontinued.

OBJECTIVES
