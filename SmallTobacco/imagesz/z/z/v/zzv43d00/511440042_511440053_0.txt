Chemistry of Nicotine/Levulinic Acid

When nicotine is combined with levulinic acid in water up to
a ratio of four equivalents of levulinic acid per equivalent F
of nicotine a monovalent nicotinium ion is formed. %

Only the pyrrolidine nitrogen of nicotine is protonated by
levulinic acid in water.

When nicotine is combined with levulinic acid in benzene,
methylene chloride, or neat at a ratio of three equivalents of
Jevulinic acid per equivalent of nicotine a monovalent
nicotinium ion is formed. At ratios less than 3:1, ionization
of nicotine is incomplete.

Only the pyrrolidine nitrogen of nicotine is protonated by
levulinic acid in benzene, methylene chloride, or neat.

Solutions of nicotine and levulinic acid in nonpolar solvents
are good models for neat mixtures of nicotine and levulinic
acid.

There is no evidence for a tight ion-pair between the
nicotinium ion and the levulinate ion in methylene chloride at
temperatures as low as -600 C (i.e. ions not salt is formed).
