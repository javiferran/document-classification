There is no evidence for a tight ion-pair between the
nicotinium ion and the levulinate ion in neat mixtures at
temperatures as low as 0o C.

e
The nicotinium ion and the levulinate ion in 1:3 mixtures of
nicotine and levulinic acid in methylene chloride form a loose
ion-pair at room temperature.

The nicotinium ion and the levulinate ion in 1:3 mixtures of
nicotine and levulinic acid in water do not form an ion-pair
at room temperature.

In aqueous solution nicotine levulinate exists as solvent
separated monovalent nicotinium cations and levulinate anions.
No interaction between these ions is evident.

In nonpolar solvents and neat mixtures nicotine levulinate
exists as loosely associated ion-pairs. lonization of nicotine
is complete only at a ratio of three equivalents of levulinic
acid to one equivalent of nicotine. It should be noted however
that if a neat mixture of one equivalent of nicotine and one
equivalent of levulinic acid is dissolved in water, complete
ionization of the nicotine will occur.
