Conclusions:

The responses of all groups indicates that at least during the first
two weeks of smoking, the subjects’ impressions from the first
evaluation changed. The subjects did not appear to adapt to certain
aspects of product performance and design characteristics. —

Few differences could be found among the group smokng the product for
the longest period of time (39 days). Ease of Use did appear to
improve for this group of subjects by the end of their smoking period.
Examination of the puff profile data from these subjects may show that
they did change their smoking behavior.

The regression model can help to understand what factors may have
contributed to changes in acceptance. The intensity of flavor, impact
and strength, the pleasantness and degree of awareness of odor, how
difficult the product is to use, and the noticeability of the
temperature of the rod are important to consider.

The comments did provide an interesting dimension that might be
explored in other extended use studies. The impression of feeling
better, while hard to define, may prove to be an important product
dimension which may be quantified in future extended usage tests.

A complete report with all details of the analyses and the results
will be prepared for inclusion in the final report for the project.

I would like to acknowledge Pat Mangan’s statistical support and Tom
Perfetti’s assistance with the interpetation of these results. Also
special thanks to Barbara Walsh for the data collection and her
review of the notebook comments and Shelia Jarrell for data entry and
recording the comments.
