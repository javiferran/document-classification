Results of the Factor Analysis and Acceptance Model

In order to understand the underlying relationship between the
attributes and between the attributes and overall acceptance, factor
and regression analyses were performed with all subjects for all
intervals.

The resulting factors were:

Overall] Intensity - Flavor Intensity, Odor Pleasantness,
Impact, and Strength.

Smoking Behavior - Ease of Lighting, Draw, Frequency of
Puffing. Length of Smoking, Number of Cigarettes Smoked,
and Ease of Use.

Smoking Quality - Consistency and Aftertaste.

Other Heat Effects - Awareness of Odor and Temperature
of the Rod.

Novelty - Flavor Uniqueness and Awareness of the
End of Smoking.

A regression model was developed to predict overall acceptance. The
factors that were included and their order of importance in the model
were Overall Intensity, Smoking Behavior, and Other Heat Effects,

The model can be interpreted as follows:

Overall Intensity - Acceptance decreases as the product is perceived
to have less flavor, less impact and strength, and a less pleasant
odor.

Smoking Behavior - Acceptance decreases as the product is perceived to
be more difficult to light and draw, lasts a short amount of time,
sives fewer puffs and less of them are smoked.

Other Heat Effects - Acceptance decreases as the odor and the
temperature of the rod is more noticeable.

Comments for All Subjects

It is difficult to form conclusions from comments since subjects were
not required to provide comments. In general the comments paralelled
the results of the quantitative data with one exception. The subjects
were not asked to respond to any attribute that related to how they
â€œfelt" while smoking the product. However ,out of the 63 times comments
were recorded, 16 of the comments included a reference to feeling
better while smoking. Many subjects did not add comments to their
