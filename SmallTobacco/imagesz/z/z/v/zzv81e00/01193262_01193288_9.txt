--- ean be employed. Preferably, about 9.1 to about 2.0% of coloring

one may obtain a material having a color similar to natural-
- tobacco by “the addition of materials such as carbon, iron

: oxide, | food dyes, tobacco. extracts, organic colorants, and ;
inorganic pigments, oz mixtures thereof to the basic smoking

materials. O£ course, contrary to natural tobacco, one may -

make the present material any color desired. - Generally, up

to about 5.0% of. coloring agent. based on the total compositicn

agent is utilized.

When the present compositions are prepared in film forn,

incorporation of a plasticizer into the film in order to in-

crease the flexibility thereof is often desirable. Plasticizere

which have been found to be suitable for this purpose include
, water, butylene glycol, giycerel, “and propylene glycol. From”
- ‘about 1 to about 30% and preferably, from about 2 to about 25%

of plasticizer based-on the total weight of the composition is

ordinarily used. - : .

- Pilm formation may also be improved by adding a wetting
agent such as Tween 20, a polyoxyethylene (20) serbitan mono-
laurate manufactured by Atlas Chemical Industries, Inc.3

- fergitol, mo, a polygiyeol ether of trimethyl nonanol manu- _-
- factured by Union carbide: or Germ-i-tol, an alkyl dinethyl
(Cy2 - Cig) benzyl ammonium chloride manufactured by Fine
Organics, Inc.? to ‘the composition prior t to preparation of
the film. preferably, about -0.05 to about 1.0% of wetting

agent is employed, with up to 10% being. suitable.

The smouldering rate of the present films is not only

felt to be attributable to the thermal conductivity coefficient -

of the filler material employed, as earlier described, but
