‘dustry to recoup public funds spent treating smoking-
preiated ilnesses.

wall idea.”

At least five states have already filed such lawsuits,

torney general hadn't decided whether or not to file a
lawsuit, and hadn’t taken a position on Burton’s pro-
posal. “we're monitoring what's being filed in the
suits { in other states,’ "he said.
