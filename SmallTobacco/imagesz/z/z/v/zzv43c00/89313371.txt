Jimny:

{a) TCRC paper:
Completed work to confirm with and without pad whole smoke
collection and anion/cation measurements~- this with Newport
85’s and with the standard research cigarette # 1580/1725.
Among others, dramatic differences ocecur both depending on
the location of the Cambridge pad and on the nature of trap
solvent [water to methanol and combinations thereof]. Sample
ion profile changes with time also recorded. Some slides from
an internal presentation will be usable; the rest being gathered
now. The internal deadline(DR) is ~ mid-July. We'll do it.

(b) Mandy’s enzymes/cellulose acetate fiber:
Memo distributed/ including to Bob Lake and tec B.J. Craven.

The effect of MnOZ is real-- dose-dependence should be tested.

Maltol embodies in one molecule the whole cont:ribution one would
get from sugar browning/caramelization(e.g.: with FP-9, FP-17, FP-19 -
type browning media). These media had undergone complete Ames testing and
had passed with flying colors). The fact maltol contributes zero nitrogen
to the smoke is a positive from the biological aspect. HMF and related

furans (all:...natural...) would also be key representatives of browning
without N-contribution.

(d) Trainee help to a sensitive area has been discussed via Jack. I can
elaborate if you wish me to.

Jimmy :
(a) Most of time. spent on completing time studies of aging whole
smoke samples by anion and cation IC, and distilling the whole

smoke material (including standard profiles and some quantitative
data) into a limited number of slides.

(b) More than expected time had to be devoted to solving crises
where trainees were needed (both in Research and in QM).
