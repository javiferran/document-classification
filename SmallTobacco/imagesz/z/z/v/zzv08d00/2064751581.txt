In Vitro Cell Transformation-C3H 10T 1/2 Cells (Reznikoff et al., 1973)
Assessment Period: 1974-?

Assay Principle: (C74-3815)

* endpoint: Transformation scored on basis of altered morphology, ability to grow in semisolid agar,
agglutination by conconavalin A

© = method: C3H 10T1/2 cells

Resutts/Comments:

* — systems like hamster embryo employ early passage cells from whole animals- morphology and genetic
makeup vary from batch to batch. Low plating efficiency, limited growth in culture (C74-3815)

* advantages of continuous cell line: easy to grow, high cloning efficiency, homogeneous cell
population, large numbers of cells easily available, cells of mouse origin may correlate better with in
vivo data, in vivo testing of transformed cells more easily done because of availability of suitable hosts
(C74-3815)
