Attached are some proposed talking points relating to Thailand that could be used to supplement the
gencral points as to why US legislation with extraterritorial effect does not make any sense. This draft
distilis thinking from Mark and Betty.

We would not suggest getting into how our cigarette brand names might be present in the Thai
market. Any such discussion would need to take into account point-of-sale, including dispensers, etc.,
which could be characterized as “prominent” in Thai retail environments, and we can't say for certain
that brand images that are not identified by brand name but are closely associated with the brand
(e.g., a "Marlboro Country"-like Western scene), cannot be found in Thailand.

Please feel free to make any comments or suggestions.
