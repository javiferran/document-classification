Analysis of the Gaseous Phase of Cigarette Sroke 10.
KEGAN gS

in absorption of the constituent in the presence of olher molecules.

This technique gave reasonably consistent resuis for the qualitative

and quantitative analysis of the msjor components of the gas phase,

The infrared technique must be supplemented by other methods, such

as mass spectroscopy, to obtain a complete anslysis; for some of the

chief constituents of the gas phase such a5 nitrogen, oxygen end

hydrogen are infrared inactive. .

In the last few years the gas chromatographic technique has
become dominent as the method of analysis. Yowever, as versatile
as it is, gas chromatography carnot supply all the answers. Patton
and Tovey [22] vere among the first authors to report the use of gas
chromatography for the separation of the components in the vapor
phase of cigarette smoke. Shortly after, Szulczewski end Higucki
(28] found that a number of permener.t gases could be separated end
determined with the thernal conductivity detector and + eclimr of
Silica gel at dry ice-acetone temperatures. This method was devel -
oped further by other authors. Netrsom2 and Keith [18] used a 16
foot, i/k inch stainless steel column packed with Linde 5A moleculs
SBieves to measure nitrogen, oxygen, water and carbon monoxide,
Mumpower, et al. (16] measured carbon monoxide with Linde 13X
molecular sieves at room temperature and Jarrell and de La Burde
(12] used dual columns, on? of silica gel and the second of 13x
molecular sieves, end dual detection to determine all these gaseous )

products.
