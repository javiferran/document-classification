Analysis of the Gaseous Phase of Cigarette Smoke 3.
iIKGGOS70EN

The importance of the butt length to the total smke concentra-

tion has been realized for many years. It hes been demonstrated that

the unburned tobacco portion can even serve as an effective filter

for some of the permanent gases. The quantitative estimations of

the gaseous phase components have been based on cigarettes which

were smoxed to butt lengths varying from 7 to 35 mm. There is no

generally accepted standard for butt length.

A. Derivative Formation

The collection method used in the study of the gaseous phase
depends, of course, on the particular prrpose of the investigetion.
Tovey [30] used a collection train consisting of two absorption
flasks containing an aqueous solution of dimedon [5,5-dimethyl-1,5-
eyclohexanedione ] to collect the volatile aldehydes. A similar .
trapping system consisting of a flask cortaining solvent and reagents
followed by a cold finger trap cooled with a dry ice-elcohol mixture
was employed by Sold and McRae {15] to collect low molecular weight

aldehydes and ketones.

B. Chemical Absorption

Newsome, Norman and Keitn [19] collected the vapor components
by using an evacuted flesk containing 10 ml of an absorbing solution
appropriate to the component under study: Folloving a single puff,

the sample was transferred to an absorbing solution by manual

+

shaking. A simple modification of the besic smoking system allows

the collection of samples of specific components from repetitive
