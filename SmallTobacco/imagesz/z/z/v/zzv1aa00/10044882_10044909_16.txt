Analysis of the Gaseous Phese of Cigarette Smoke 16.

methods reviewed in this perer. ovever, for a routine study of the
gaseous phese one doss not necd to determine all the components.
The analysis of a few selected components carn serve to indicate the
concentration of the other components within the seme boiling range.
For such an investigation the infrared and mass spectrophotometric

methods are too clumsy to be usoful, while the gas chromatographic

technique with its applicability to the majority of vepor phase

components end its ability to function over a wide range of concen-

trations affords the singlest and most reliable approach.

Phe graphs that follox show the composition of the gaseous
phase of cigarette smoke. Although the values given represent good
approximations, mention should be made of the fact that experinental
results are often otta2ined from blends of tobacco which are not
found in commercial cizarettes, and that almost all conditions for

the collection of such del2 vary fron one laboratory to another.
