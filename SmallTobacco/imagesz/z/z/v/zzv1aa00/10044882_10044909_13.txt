Analysis of the Gaseous Phase of Cigarette Smoke 13.

HRGEOOS TO? ]

end thermal stability permits the separation of vapor phase components

which have a wide range of volatility without vhe use of a vacuum

system or a multicolumn chromatographic operation.

Cc. Carbonyl Compounds

Touey [30] determined the aldehyde content of the gaseous
phase by reacting the aldehydes with 5,5-dimethyl-1, 3-cyclohexanedione
in a gas absorption flask. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted
to 3.9 and allowed to precipitate for 24 hours. After filtering and
drying, the precipitation is weighed, and the amount of aldehyde
present is calculated as "apparent acetaldehyde." Mold and MoRae
(15] allowed the cigarette smoke to react with 2,h-dinitropheayl-
hydrazine. The phenylhydrazones were quantitatively extracted from
the reaction mixture with benzene ond seperated by parer chrome-
tography. The quantivevive estimations are calculated by direct

comparison of optical densities with known derivatives.

D. Miscellaneous Products

A few gaseous ph2se constituents are difficult to define as
belonging to a particular class of compounds, and for this reeson
@re generally referred to as "miscellaneous prodvets." Each of
these components, because of their interest and because of their
own physical and chemical nature, can be estimated in the presence

of other gaseous material.

Hydrogen cyenids has been estimated by the electrometric
