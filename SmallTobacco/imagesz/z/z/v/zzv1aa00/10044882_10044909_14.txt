Murty and Viswananthan [17 ). The converting of cyanid= to cyanogen
chloride with chloramine T and the subsequent reaction of this
cyanogen chloride with tn aqueous pyridine solution containing the
pyrazolone reagent, projuces a dye which is steble for at least 10
minutes and which follows the Beer-Lambert law between the limits
of 0.2 to 1.2 micrograns of cyanide ion [4]. Good results are
obtained when a double beam speectrophotometer is used with a blank

containing the smoke solution and reagents, less the chloramine T.

Rydrogen sulfide can best be determined by the methyl tiue
colorimetric method [10]. Maximum color development is complete
within two hours and its absorbance determined at 665 mi against a

reagent blank.

The oxides of nitrogen, because of their importance and dif-
ficulty of analysis, Lave beer given srecial emphasis in the
literature. Pbilippe and Hackney; [23] using the infrared compensation
technique shoved the presence of nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide and
methyl nitrite. Haagen-Smit, Brunelle and Hara [7] determined the
sum of the two oxides by the Saltzman [26] colorinetric procedure.

In this method the Griess-Ilosvay recgent is used to â€˜develop the color
after the oxidation process. The NO and NOz concentratiors are
estimated by the emount of pink azo dye formed, as measured Ly the
optical density of the reaction mixture at 550 mi. Norman and Keith
(20] round that due to the considerable difference in volatility of

NO end NOg, the two oxides could be eftectively separated by a cold
