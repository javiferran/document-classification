the smoke from four cigarettes. The trap itself becomes an integral
part of the injection system by using it asa loop in the gas sampling
valve and placing a streem splitter upstreen from the ges chroma-
tographic column. After the trap is sealed and heated for 15 minutes
et 95-100°C, the preheated carrier gas is fed through the trap for

60 seconds. ‘The injection efficiency under these conditions .s

The analysis of the fresh, uncondensed, gaseous phese also
presents problems. Without condensation the study is limited to a
Single puff or a puff by puff determination. The high dilution of
the vapor phase constituents, the large number of components, and
their differing chemical end physical character are some of the

factors vith which one has to contend.

The direct sampling of gaseous components from a single puff
for analysis by gas chromatography was used by Humpower, Lewis and
Touey [16], Grob [5], and Williamson and Allman [32]. The methods
used by these investigators are, in general, the same. The puff is
drawn directly into a gas sarpling valve and fills a sample loop,
of usually, 0.5 to 5 ml volume. The contents of the sample loop

ere introduced directly into the currier gas stream and the separs-

tion started within e second.
