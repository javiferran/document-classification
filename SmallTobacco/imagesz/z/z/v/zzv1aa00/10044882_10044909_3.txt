puffs on one or more cigarettes. In this system each puff is col-
lected in a smoke collection flask, which is re-evacuated prior to
the next puff The gases removed from the flask during the re-

evacuation process are collected in fritted bubble traps placed

between the collection flask and the vacuum pump.

Keith and Tesh [13] reported a reasonably Simple and reliable
method to determine the total gaseous materials contained in a puff
of smoke. The measurement of this material was based on the increase
in weight of a tared flask containing 5A moleculer sieve pellets.

The source of vacuum for the system was obtained by cooling the
flask to liquid air temperature. This unique method does not require

the use of a conventional smoking machine.

D. Cold Trap

An extensive investigation of low temperature collection and
fractionation was conducted by Osborne, Ademek and Hobbs [21]. The
gas collected in a syringe after each puff was transferred to an
evacuated ccllection chamber and cooled to liquid air temperature.
Periodically, the noncondenseble gas was permitted to expard into a
previously evacuated reservoir where the pressure and volume were
determined end the gas eventually returned to the collection chamber.
The condensed mixture was evaporated and re-collected in traps cooled

to the desired temperature by the liquid air cooling of a heat trans-

fer fluid in which the traps were immersed. Ine system was capable
