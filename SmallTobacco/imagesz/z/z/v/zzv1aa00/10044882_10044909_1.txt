ebaracteristics of the cigarette. The division of materials effected
by such filters has generally become empirically defined as the divi-
sion between particulate and gaseous phases; although, it is realized
that many of the vapors, particulerly those or lesser volatility, are
partitioned between the condensed phase and the gaseous phase of

smoke, and that some may be adsorbed by the filter pad. Thus, larger

amounts may be present in the total smoke stream than are indicated

by those found ‘in the vapor phase by the usual method of analysis.
3. Methods of Smoke Collection

Of the many factors which will alter the composition and
eoncentratior. of the smoke constituents, the first is the manner
in which the cigarette is smoked,or, more specifically, how the
cigarette puff is taken. The smoking procedures reported in the
literature for the investigction of cigarette smoke vary fron a
Single continuous draw to a puff of 4b ce with a 1.9 second duration
taken at 20 second intervals to a puff of 35 cc with a two second
duration taken once eacn minute. One inves+igavor used a puff
interval of 15 seconds. The mention of the puff profile is
practically absent in these papers. Keith and Newsone [12]
reported that the average human puff is characterized by a velocity
which rises rapidly to a maximm, falls véry Slowly until about
balf of the puff time has elapsed, and then falls more rapidly until
the end of the puff. The most generally accepted smoking conditions
are 55 cc puff volume taken over a two second duration at a frequency

of one per minute.
