Analysis of the Gaseous Phase of Cigarette Smoke ll.

B. Organic Vapor
. During this:sace period, the gas chromatographic separation
of the organi: vapor of the gaseous phase was under development. In
1959, Irby and Harlow [9] reported some quantitative results for the
constituents of the organic vapor of cigarette smoke. Separation
of this material was obtained on a 2.5 meter, 1/4 inch copper colum
packed with 20 per cent tetraethyleneglycoL dimethyl ether coated
on Celite. A second column of Celite coated with 20 per cent sili-

cone 702 was used to complete the seperation of certain mixtures.

’ The therma] corductivity detector wes also used in this work, and

the smoke of two to four cigarettes was condensed to obtain a suf-

ficiently concentrated sazple.

With the widespread acceptance of the flame ionization detector,

the study of the vapor phase constituents grew rapidly. Grob [5]

wes one of the first to report the separation and fdentification of
some 64 substances with a boiling range from 2 to 200°C. Tetre-_
ethyleneglycol dimevnyi ether and other polar stationary liquids

were coated in capillary columns 50 meters X .02 inch J.D. to obtain
the necessary separations. Grob [6] made sore interesting observa-
tions concerning the partition equilibrium and temperature. He also
noted that the very reactive smoke components did not pass through

the stainless steel columns. For this reason he used an all glass

system in recent studies.

In one of the most thorough investigations to dat> on the

composition of the vapnr phase, Newsome, et al. [19] reported the
