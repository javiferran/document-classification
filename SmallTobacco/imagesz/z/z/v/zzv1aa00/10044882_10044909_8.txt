in the vapor phese of cigarette smoke without specifying the indi-
vidual components.- After the puff, the helium carrier gas is

ellowed to flow through the sample Loop, and the sample is carried

steel

through an unpacked 1/8 inch stainlessAor copper column to a flame
ionization detector. The nature of this analysis is such that the

time for analysis corresponds to the time necessary to smoke the

â€˜cigarette, and thus the methoi is very rapid. Moreover, since each

individual puff is analyzed consecutively, information about the
total organic content of each puff, as well as the entire cigarette,

is obtained.

The composition of the gas stream is considerably altered on
passage through the cigarette. Dilution of the stream by air entering
around the edges of the cone end through the paper wrapper increases
the oxygen and nitrogen concentrations at the expense of other gases.
In addition, gases present in the stream are adsorbed on or distilled

from the tobaceo, or diffuse out through the pecer wrapper. In sone
instances reactions occur among components of the strean, Because

of these alterations, the work of Newsome end Keith [18] is worthy

of special note. The collection of the gas stream components was
accomplished by positioning a syringe needle somewhere along the axis
of the cigarette and sealing it into the paper wrapper. The gas tight
syringe, which was spring loaded to provide a reproducible sampling
rate, had a sampling volume of 1 or 2 ml in order to acconodate the
change in gas concentrations occurring throughout the cigarette.

When the proper burning position had been reached, a steady: 20 ml
