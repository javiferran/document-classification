II. Methods of Anelysis

The method used for the qualitative and semiquantitative anal-
ysis of the vapor phase of cigarette smoke usually depends on whether
one wishes to determine permanent gases, inorganié gases, low boiling
bydrecarbons, oxygenated compounds ‘or any one of several distinct
constituents which can be partially separeted from tae bulk of the

gaseous phase components.

A. Permanent and Inorganic Gases

Infrared spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy have played an
important role in our knowledge of the gaseous phase. These techniques
were employed by Osborne, et al. [21] and Philippe ané Bobhs [2h] in
@ comprehensive study of the gaseous phase. Analysis of the inal-
vidual constituents in a gas mixture was based on a conpensation
technique using a recording infrared spectrophotomster equipped with
10 cm gas cells. In the ideal case, the method required the identi-
fication of the ccastivuent present in the sample cell, followed by
the introduction of the pure constituent into the reference or
compensating cell, until 4 selected characteristic absorption band
due to the compound in question was nullified. Such a procedure is
greaily Siuplitied if the specific wave length selected for the
component is not subjected to interference from the absorption bands

of other components present in the mixture, and if itere is no change
