absorption trap. Measurements of initiel, intermediate ead final

puffs of the test cigarette gave essentially the sane results, that

all the nitrogen oxide is the nitric oxide a.d that nitrogen dioxide

is present, at most, in trace quantities.

Aumonia is determined by trapping the smoke in dilute sulfuric
acid and heating tne solution for one hour at 90-110°C to expel inter-
“fering acidic gases and acetone. After cooling and adding Nessler’s
reagent, the sample is diluted and the optical density measured at
450 m: [25]. This method does not differentiate between amuonium

salts and free emnonia.

Formaldehyde is best estimated ty the chromotropic acid nethod
(1]. Unsaturated hydrcearbons and acrolein interfere with this
determination, but the utilizetion of an aqueous collection system
and a base line sorrection essentially eliminates these effects.
Particulate smoke collected ui the Canbridge filter pads adsorb
eppreciable quantities of formaldehyde and, therefore, should be

replaced efter each puff.
WI. Discussion and “Analytical Data

Most of the analytical metheds for the determination of the
gaseous phase constituents of cigarette smoke are either quite
lengthy, fail to give quantitative results due to unavoidable losses
through multimanipulations, or are limited to the anulysis of a single
puff. Fer the identification and estimation of these gaseous compo-

nents it is certainl, necessary toa emnlo, a coubination of the
