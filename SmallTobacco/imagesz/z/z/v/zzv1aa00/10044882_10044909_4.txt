of maintaining the trap et any temperature between -170°C and room

temperature.

This method of collection and fractionation-of the gaseous
phase was simplified to sone degree by Irby and Herlow [9], although
the trapping system remained rather elsborate. In this methed the
smoke was collected in a LeRoy still cooled to -196°C. The non-
condensables can be quantitatively removed from the still. The still
end the main trap are so constituted that, by proper reguiation of
the voltage applied to the heater and of the vacuum applied to the
ease surrounding them, any desired temperature from -196°C upward
can be obtained. By altering the temperature of the still and the
trap, evaporative distillation can be carried out. The carrier gas
flow is srranged to flow through this irap so that it can also serve

@s a sample inlet trap for a gas chrozatograrh.

Such techniques of cellection as these, in addition to being ,
time-consuming, generally permit the partial loss of some components
through imperfect collection, velatizetion during fractionation, or
through chemical interaction of the condensed vapors. Also, the
resulis cbtained by such methods are quite dependent on the collection

system employed, as this frequently alters the partition of the less

volatile components betveen the vapor an2 the particula:e phases.

The method of collection enployed by Irby and harlow was
modified by Grob [5] who replaced the still with a collection trap

made of a 2,25 meter glacs criral with a wius of 40 ec. Tne smoke
