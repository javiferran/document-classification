Analysis of the Gaseous Phase of Cigarette Smoke 6.
- WENO U6 4

eomponents collected at -75°C were warmed to room temperature with

a smal] flow of helium and held for 45 minutes. This step was
mecessary to remove all the carbon dioxide, which would give a high
response with the use of a thermal conductivity detector. The
temperature was then increased to €0°C, and after 30 seconds, the
constituents carried through e stripping column, on which water was

removed, then cnto the chromatographic column. .

Laurene, Lyerly and Young [14] did nct fractionate the gaseous
phase of smoke after it was condensed at liquid nitrogen temperatures
ina 2h inch, 1/4 0.D. copper tubing coil. The smoking machine, the
Cigarette, the cbrom@tographic column, and the smoke trap were all
connected to a gas sampling valve. After the smoking of one cigarevie,
the gas valve was positioned to direct helium through the cold trap.

ter ten minutes, the liquid nitrogen was removed and a previously
heated [125°C] oil bath was raised to immerse the trap. Following
emergence of COp from the column, the sensitivity was increesed to

record the eluting of the orge;ic components.

A similar trapping system was reported by Spears and Routh
(27]. These authors studied different trep designs and found that
spiral glass traps could be 97 per cent efficient for the collection
at -80°C of isoprene, acetone, acetaldehyde, acrolein and toluene,
if certain conditions were met. These conditions include the rela-
tionskip between purr volume and trap volune, puff frequency, and

number of puffs. The trap shown in Figure I is capable of collecting
