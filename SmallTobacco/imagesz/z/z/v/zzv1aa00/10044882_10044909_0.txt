ANALYSIS OF THE GASEOUS PHASE OF CIGARETTE SMOKE ~

A number of anslyses were performed on the gaseous components
of tobacco smoke during the first helf “of the twentieth century,
but it was not until the 1950’s, when the availability and wide-
spread use of more sophisticated quantitative instrumentation made
it possible to determine very minute concentrations, that the major
eontribution concerning the vapor phase composition appeared in
print. Until this time, the emphasis had been placed on the

particulate metter of cigarette smoke, which comprises little more

than one-twentieth of the whole smoke.

fhe analysis of cigarette smoke, composed of atmospheric
gases and a cemplex mixture of substances derivec fron the conbus-
tion end pyrolysis of tobacco, peses a difficult problen, For
purposes of analysis, 1t is convenient to separate these substances
into a particulate phase and a gaseous phase. Seversl zood eiltering
materials have been reported that remove over 99 per cent of the
smoke particulate matter. Eowever, a glass fiber fiiter medium,
Cembridge filter No. CM-115 [Cambridge Filter Corporation, Syracuse,
Rew York] y' Dost nearly meets the requirements for quentitetive
studies. This filter, originally studied by Wartman, Cogbill and
Harlow (31], removes about 99.8 per cent of the particulate phase
and has the added advantease of a high loading capacity without

developing a resistance to air flow sufficient to alter the puff
