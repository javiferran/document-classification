isolation and estimation of some 80 different materials. Three major
column systems were utilized, one being for lov molecular weight
hydrocarbons, and the other two for lerge hydrocarbons and oxygenated

smoke components. To achieve better reproducibility 1/8 inch columns

were used instead of the capillary columns.

Philippe, et al. [25] have also analyzed semiquantitatively
@ number of gaseous hydrocarbons. Their gas caromatographic appa-
ratus was a laboratory built instrurent with a thermal conductivity
detector. The primary column was a 9 foot, 1/4 inch coiled copper
tube packed with activated alumina and kept at room temperature. To
reduce the retention of the gas mixture components, the alumina was
partially deactivated by passing the carrier gas over CuSQ,°5H20.
Some fractions eluted frou the colwm contained more than one
component. and were further frectionsted at rena tempersture on a

second column of alumina coated with 3,3’ -oxydipropionitrile.

Many other investigzitors have made contributions to the gas
chromatographic method of analysis of cigarette snoke, but perhaps
the more notevorthy are, Willianson and Allmsn [52], Laurene, et al.

(24), and Spears and Routh [27].

’ The Spears and Routh method of vapor phase analysis offers
@ routine Precedure for the evaluation of filter materials. The
@etermination of the major constituents of the ccllected smoke can
be accomplished quickly and relatively accurately. The subambient
