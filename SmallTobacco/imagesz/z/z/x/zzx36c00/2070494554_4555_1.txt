Direct-Marketing Dangers

As Beverly Dennis learned the hard
way, each time you fill out a con-
sumer survey, a product-registration
card or a sweepstakes entry form,
you are most likely entering infor-
mation about yourself into a com-
puterized mailing list that can be
sold or rented out to countless com-
panies for marketing purposes. Like-
wise, when you use 4 credit card to
order fram a catalog or a grocery
store’s savings bonus card at the
checkout line, information about
your buying habits is linked to your
name and address in a list that may
be rented many times.

Public records are another source
for companies looking for market-
ing leads. When you have a baby,
buy a home or even file a change-
of-address form at the post office,
there is a good chance your name
is being entered into at least one
marketer's computer database.
“Once information about you is out
there, you lose all control over it—
things happen and you may never
know why,” says Dave Banisar of
the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, a consumer-advocacy group
in Washington, D.C.

The direct-mail industry denies
that it compromises consumer priva~
cy and safety. In the interest of con~
sumer privacy, the Direct Marketing
Association (DMA), headquartered
in Washington, D.C., does require
that irs members adhere to specific
guidelines, including finding out
how their mailing lists will be used
before they ate solid.

Metromail, whose clients include
most major magazines, including
Ladies* Home Journal, calls what hap-
pened to Beverly Dennis an aberra-
tion. “It was not our practice to use
prison labor,” says Tim Fitzpatrick,
vice president of corperate communi-
cations for Metromail. “Metromail
acquired another company that had a
subcontracting agreement with the

Here are some steps you
ean take to protect yourself:
4. Whenever you mail in a warranty
or product registration card, the
information you provide will
probably be entered into a
marketing database. “You don't
tose any legal rights by not mailing
in the cards; the information is
tainly used for marketing
purposes,” says consumer privacy
advocate Dave Banisar.
2, Think twice before participating
in informal health screenings that
are offered at pharmacies, shopping
malis or other nonmedical settings.
The information collected may end
up being sold to various businesses
that will then solicit you to buy
medications or other products
related to your test results.
3. To get your name off mailing lists
for preapproved offers of credit
(which can provide thieves with key
financial data about you if the
unsolicited mailings are not
shredded before being thrown in the
trash}, notify the three major credit
bureaus by calling Experian (800-
353-0809) and Trans Union {800-
680-7293) and writing to Equifax
Ontions, P.O. Box 740123, Atlanta,
GA 30374.
4, Do not carry your Social Security
card in your wallet, and only give
out your number when it is
required—primarily for tax-related

Texas prison system. Clearly, we feel
that what happened to Beverly Den-
nis was exceptionally unyYortunate,
but we believe customer surveys are a4
responsible way to go ahout direct
marketing.” Although Metromail no
longer contracts convicts to process
its surveys, prison inmates in thirty-
one states still routinely work for oth-
er private companies, in jobs ranging
from data processing to answering
§00-number telephone calls.

Banning the use of prison labor to
process sensitive consumer informa-
tion is one of the goals of the Kids
Off Lists Coalition, an advocacy

information that’s already out there

telephone numbers of millions of
children through a 900 telephone

was able to obtain a list of five
thousand kids for two hundred sev-
