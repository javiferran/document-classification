La. w. Ty Hoyt,

Tobacco Induatry xesearch Committes,
150 Bast 42nd Street,

wew York 17, N.Y.

Dear ky, Hoyt:

Recent publicity in the press about the "findings" by researchers

on the subject of cigarette smoking and lung cancer created & scare
which may have some effect on cigarette sales. And if the researchers
oress their claims further I believe that cigarette sales will va
affected a great deal with monetary losses to the tobacco industry.

I firmly believe that should the researchers prove beyond doubt
that excess cigarette smoking causes lung cancer the tobacco
industry would openly warn the public of such a danger, Conversely,
af the deaders Digest, for inatance, learned that there is no ’
danger of lung cancer in cigarette smoking, even excessively, they
would retract their “hostility” toward smoking, and even may come
to the support of the cigaratte induetry.

T have been studying this problem for some time and I have discovered
a "solution" to your problem, (to allay scare of smoking tobacco).

I would like to present my solution to the vroper "agency". Naturally
I would like to be compensated for this service. If your organization
is the proper "agency" to negotiate such a proposition please let

me know and I will submit it to you. Cf course, if my "aolution"

1S not acceptable you are not obligated to pay me anything.

if your organization is not the proper "agency" to negotiate such

& proposition (authorized to pay for sarvices) would you be kind
anoush to let me know of their name and address?

Sincerely yours, |

Seorge Haig
