coated on cigarette paper. Two potentially more stable release compounds,
Gluco-vanillin and Gluco-ethylvanillin, have been requested from the vendor.
Currently a small sample of Gluco-vanillin has been received and cigarette
paper coating is in progress for use in Ambrosia prototypes. When
sufficient quantities of both compounds are available, National Starch will
attempt to incorporate them in side-seam adhesives.

Subjective evaluations are continuing on the various prototypes made
during the week of 8-7-89. Selected models will be used for Focus Group
testing.

Low sidestream papers and side-seam adhesives, prepared with low
concentrations of Aromatek 245, have been incorporated in 19.5 mm
circumference prototypes.

PROJECT VALUE:

Prototypes have been made in the full flavor and lights KS
configurations. Both flavored and cased-only versions were produced. A
Pyramid type blend and casing/aftercut from Project Re-enter (Canada) was
used.

OW _TAR/EIGH FLAVOR:
Project 605:

Samples using Blend 3 (from Project 202) and Blend F (from Project
Natural) with CA/CA web filters and concentric peripheral flow filters
are being made this week. These models will be cased with no aftercut.
Blend A models using CA-Web/CA filters at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40%
ventilation will be completed the week of 9-21-89.

Project Novent:

Samples using Blend A, Blend F (from Project Natural) and Blend 3 (from
Project 202), incorporating ESP papers, are being made this week.

MARLBORO STANDARDIZATION:

Preliminary analytical data have been received from CI for Standard VII
cigarettes. Of the four lots of Winston received for POLâ€™s, all except
Lot #3 have been subjectively and analytically approved for overtipping.

A final report is in preparation for the Marlboro 6/13 factory pickup.

 

Export Cigarettes for Canada: Disclosure information has been drafted.

Guatemala: Model evaluation in Richmond is on hold awaiting on-site
prototype fabrication.
