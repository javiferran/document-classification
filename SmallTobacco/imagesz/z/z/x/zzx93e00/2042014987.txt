PHILIP MORRIS, U.S.A. INTEROFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10017
TO: Distribution DATE: April 29, 1985

FROM: Ralph Atlas

SUBJECT: LORILLARD SHELF PLAN REVISION

Attached is a copy of Lorillard's new carton shelf payment
schedule effective June 1, 1985.

The changes are as follows:

e Top payment now is $104.00 per month. On previous contract
the payment was $119.00.

@ The lowest volume category (100-199) has been eliminated.

@ In stores having only one standard fixture, “one full shelf"
is interpreted as either 12 or 16 rows per shelf, however,
in stores with multiple racks, “one full shelf" must
represent 16 rows, with extra rows being contiguous.

The purpose is to upgrade Lorillard's position in all stores when
they only occupy 12 rows to 16 rows. However, their
correspondence states that "if a retailer adamantly objects to
giving Lorillard the required additional rows, do not jeopardize
the arrangement -- we will grandfather those, locations."
