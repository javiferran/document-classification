Subject: 2002 Mechanisms of Toxicity Gordon Research Conference

The the 2002 Mechanisms of Toxicity Gordon Research Conference is being held
Sunday, July 21-Friday, July 26, 2002 at Bates College, Lewiston, Maine.
Over the past several years, this meeting has evolved into the premier small
meeting focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying toxicant response.
This year’s program continues this tradition with sessions on: Applications

of Genomics and Proteomics to Toxicology, Redox-Regulated Transcriptional
Control, Receptor-Mediated Toxicity, Molecular Mechanisms of Developmental
Toxicity, Genetic Susceptibility to Toxicants, and others. In addition,

there will be a keynote address by Dr. Bruce Hammock and Late Breaking
Reserach Presentations chosen from submitted poster abstracts. Complete
program information and registration information can be obtained at:

As Chair of this year's conference, | would urge you to consider attending
this meeting. The format has been developed to provide lively discussion
and many opportunities for participants to interact on an informal basis.

Looking forward to seeing you this summer in Maine!
