Monthly Report, Project Delta - April 1982

Objectives:

1. Provide experimental data for nontobacco smoking article patent
application.

2. Conduct experiments on the use of heat to transfer flavor.

3. Conduct experiments to measure the transfer efficiency of flavorants
from tobacco to smoke.

4. Prepare reports on extrusion technology and the preparation of
nontobacco combustible heat sources.

Conclusions:

1. A meeting was held on the fifteenth of April with Bob Shaw to discuss
our application for a patent on nontobacco smoking articles. Bob is now
preparing the application based on information supplied at the meeting.
Experiments are being conducted which will supply additional data requested.

2. The electric cigarette has been used to generate a smoke aerosol
from after-cut solution. Initial measurements show that a typical after~cut
taste is produced when the gas stream temperature is 150°C. When the gas
stream temperature is raised to 200°C the taste degenerates to a burned sugar
character. Additional experiments are being conducted to measure the
temperature of the solution during heating under each of the above conditions.

3. Our G.C. has been fitted with two new columns in order to enhance
our ability to measure the concentration of flavors in TPM extracts. The
system is being recalibrated for the new columns.

4. Information from our notes is being assembled for reports on various
aspects of experimental efforts during the course of Project Delta. One special
report on binderless extrusion has been prepared and others on foamed tobacco,
combustible heat sources, the delivery of extruded tobacco, and the taste of
extruded tobacco articles, are being written.
