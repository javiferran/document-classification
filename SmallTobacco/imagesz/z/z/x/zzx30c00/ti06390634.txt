, Dear Alan:

Further on the matter of your pending viait, T would

+ like to suggest that-you correspond directly with

those you are interested in seeing, other than the
members of our staff. To assist you I am enclosing
a list of current addresses. _

The reason for this suggestion’is a bit complicated.
Por one thing Charlie and Marvin have both retired .
from The Institute...In addition, three of our member
“companies have tncorporated a new organization,
the Center for Indoor ‘Air Research, to look after
. the ‘scientific matters ‘related to the ETS controversy |
and to monitor and sponsor relevant research... While
no formal arrangements have yet been made I suspect
that CIAR will be taking over consultations with
more or less the same persons with whom you would .
like to visit. Boe aS . :

 

‘The ‘acting ‘Executive: Director of the CIAR is Dr.
Guy * ‘Oldaker at Reynolds.. For that reason, and because
of ‘your expressed interest in visiting the RJR research

facility «I have included Guy’ s address on the attached :

    

Regarding your visit. to The Institute,: let me know 5%
‘when’ you ‘can of: the’. "hole" in your. schedule so. that :

I: can arrange ; time’ fora: ‘couple oF: us to meet with
yous oR “ :

  

oud hope’ you will ‘find. this. satisfectory. “We certainly #228

look forward to seeing | you.

Co dtaliys
