Specially Processed Tobaccos — Evaluation

R&D Project #

Background:

Cigarettes made with a blend containing several specially
processed tobaccos were judged to have smoking
characteristics which were different from those of RJR
blends. While the cigarettes did not have a high level of
tobacco taste, the smoke was judged to have desirable

levels of smoothness, mildness, and low aftertaste. Further
research is indicated to evaluate the use of processed
tobaccos to modify the smoking character of RJR blends.

1984 Objectives (R&D):
Conduct evaluations necessary to make recommendations on

which tobacco(s) must be processed to produce blends with
desirable levels of smoothness/mildness/aftertaste/impact.
