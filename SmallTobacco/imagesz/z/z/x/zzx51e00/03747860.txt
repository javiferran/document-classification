Smoking: A Bum Rap?

- gmoking;, which may. be hazard-
ous. to the health, may not be as
hazardous as antismoking: advocates
nave alleged. So says Canadian Prof.
Theodore D. Sterling. And coinciden-
tally eight of the nation’s tobacco:
companies aré once again underwrit-
ing a projectiin hopes of proving the
point 2 "a
Professor: Sterling told the ‘Ameri-
can Association for. the Advancement
of Science in Washington, D.C.: “BY,
and large, studies.on the effects of
pollutants are so designed that they.
tend. to underplay. the effects of in-
dustrial on air pollutants on: health,
while studies on the effects of smok-
ing are so: designed that they would
overestimate the effects of smoking
on health.” He also charged that the
American Cancer Society and the
U.S. Publio: Health Service are with-
holding information needed: for a
“dispassionate evaluation" 'of:cigaret
smoking's link to. lung cancer.
Eighti tobacco: companies appar-
ently agree. They announced finan-
cing of a $2:8:million Harvard Medi-
cal Schoo}investigation into the re+
Jationship between tobacco: smoking
and lung and hearti disease. Said one
researcher ‘on the five-year project:
“while itiis common knowledge that!
cigaret smoking has been alleged to
be a major cause:of these diseases,
many other factors may also be im-
portant." Among them: air pollut-
ants and:human genetic differences.
