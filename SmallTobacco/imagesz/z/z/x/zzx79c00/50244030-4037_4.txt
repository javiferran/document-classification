Two points merit discussion. First, the time course is pre-
dicted to be biexponential with rate constants of A, and A,.
Moreover, the ratio of the amplitudes of these two exponentials
is inversely related to their magnitude. Substitution of typical
values of ky, kz, ky, and k,, for transfer within an HDL pop-
ulation, shows A, to be 250s and A, 0.13 X 10°s!. The
amplitude of ,, the more rapid component, is calculated from
250/0.13 X 10° and is 0.02 of that of d,, the slower component.
For practical purposes then, the time course is predicted to
be monoexponential.

Second, for the special case of homogeneous transfer, where
k, = k, and kz = k3, 4, reduces to &, and A, to ky + k(L,
+ £5). The sum of d, is that observed in relaxation experi-
ments and probably corresponds to reestablishment of equi-
librium of the probe between water and the lipoprotein. If
this is indeed the case, then A, is the rate constant corre-
sponding to transfer of the probe between lipoproteins, and
Aq describes reestablishment of equilibrium with the solvent.
For the homogeneous transfer situation, the observed rate is
that of dissociation of the probe molecule from the donor
lipoprotein.

It is possible to predict the observed rate with values for the
rate constants ky, k,, k3, and ky. The dissociation rate con-
stants k, and i, are directly measurable from homogeneous
transfer measurements. Association rate constants k, and k;
are available indirectly from distribution coefficient mea-
surements Via k,/kz = fand kz, = f/k;. The measured dis-
tribution coefficients of pyrene between water and HDL, LDL,
and VLDL are found in Table IL.

By use of these measured and derived rate constants, the
following properties of the observed rate are predicted: (1)
the value should be between the two dissociation constants,
k, and k,; (2) the cbserved rate depends only on the ratio of
donor/acceptor lipoprotein concentrations; (3) it is unchanged
if the roles of donor and acceptor lipoproteins are reversed and
