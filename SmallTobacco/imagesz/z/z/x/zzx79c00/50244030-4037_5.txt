the concentrations remain the same; and (4) it is independent
of the probe concentration. ,

Examination of Table III, which contains data for pyrene
transfer between HDL and LDL, shows that agreement of
calculated rates with experimental data is very good and that
all of the predictions are accurate. In Table IV, however,
pyrene transfers from VLDL to HDL do not show such good
agreement. The trends in the data are correctly predicted, that
is, the rate increases with increasing donor VLDL/acceptor
HDL, but the rates are overestimated by a factor of 2-3. The
calculated rates can be made to agree very well with these
determined experimentally if the association rate constant with
VLDL is decreased 5-fold. We have no explanation for this
discrepancy.

One interesting feature is that the model involves simple
partitioning of a soluble phase between two immiscible phases
by first-order processes. In all equations, however, k, always
appears as k,L, and k; as ksZp, exactly as if the uptake oc-
curred by a second-order reaction.

By analogy with dialysis, the rate of transfer or the flux of
the probe through the lipoprotein surface might be proportional
to the total surface area. The total area, which is the product
of the number of molecules and their surface area, is pro-
portional to radius“, The predicted relationship, described
by the dashed line in Figure 4, does not correlate with the
experimental data. Better correlation was obtained between
the log of the rate constant and radius“!, shown by the solid
line in Figure 4,

’ Discussion

The results of the experiments described here support the
transfer mechanism in which the rate-limiting step in pyrene
and DG transfer between lipoproteins is the dissociation of the
probe molecules into the aqueous solution, followed by diffu-
sion in the aqueous phase and rapid uptake into another li-
poprotein (Charlton et al., 1976, 1978a). The increase by
SCN™ and decrease by SO," and Cl can be interpreted
quantitatively by the Setschenow equation in terms of salting-in
or salting-out phenomena, with the electrolytes changing the
solubility of the probe in the aqueous solution. The different
rates of transfer found in the presence of electrolytes are in
accordance with the effects predicted from the Hofmeister
series of ions (Long & McDevit, 1952) and the molal surface
tension increment produced by the salt (Melander & Horvath,
1977). Similarly, low concentrations of organic solvents in-
crease the solubility of hydrophobic molecules in the aqueous

phase, demonstrated directly by measurement of the distri-
bution coefficients. The data of Figure 3, in spite of consid-
erable scatter, show a proportionality between the observed
rates and the distribution coefficients. Differences in the values
for the distribution coefficients are attributed only to a change
in the aqueous phase solubility of the probe. This assignment
is based on the assumption that the limiting solubility of the
probe in the lipoprotein is relatively unaffected by the presence
of organic solvents in the hydrocarbon phase and that the
lipoprotein is not unduly perturbed by these concentrations
of organic soivents.

Kinetic analysis of the transfer in heterogeneous systems
containing different lipoproteins permits some predictions
about the observed rates of transfer. The rate constants should
be (a) independent of both donor and acceptor lipoprotein
concentrations when the donor/acceptor ratio is maintained,
(b) independent of the probe concentration, (c) identical in
either direction, and (d) intermediate between those observed
for dissociation of the probe from the individual lipoproteins.
All of these predictions are reasonably well fulfilled, thereby
providing convincing evidence that the proposed mechanism
of transfer through the aqueous phase by simple partitioning
is correct.. A similar mechanism is suggested for transfer of
slightly soluble molecules between polymer particles composing
an oil-in-water emulsion (Ugelstad & Mork, 1980).

The calculations show that, in order for the predicted ratc
to reflect that measured experimentally, the possible range of
the association rates is quite restricted. Association constants
that accurately predict the rate of transfer in a system with
dissimilar lipoproteins are the same as those calculated by
dividing the dissociation rate constant by the distribution
coefficient. Such agreement supports the postulate that
transfer of hydrophobic compounds such as pyrene and the
diglyceride analogue can be treated simply in terms of dis-
tribution between two immiscible solvents.

Inspection of Figure 4 and the data in Table I, which contain
the rates of transfer of pyrene and DG in between a number
of homogeneous reaction systems, reveals that the desorption
rate from HDL is 20 times greater than that of VLDL; yet
the distribution coefficients of pyrene between HDL, LDL,
and VLDL are all very similar.

According to a current model (Shen et al., 1977), lipo-
