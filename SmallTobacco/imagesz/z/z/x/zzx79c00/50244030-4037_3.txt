@ Duplicate entries are from separate lipoprotein preparations
from different individuals. From the measured rate constants
over a temperature range of 25 °C, values for the activation
energies, £,, were obtained. AG? of the activated state was
calculated from eq 25 where AT/h =6.11 X10"? at 20°C, The
enthalpy of activation was calculated from AH* = £,-RT;
entropy of activation AS” was calculated from AG* = AH? —
Tas*.

 

coefficients as a function of the observed rate of DG transfer
between HDL in these solvents showed a clear relationship
{Figure 3). The rate of transfer increased as the partition
coefficients became larger. Similar experiments were at-
tempted with pyrene as the probe. No reliable data were
obtained, since the rate of transfer in the presence of some of
the salts and the organic solvents exceeded the resolution limit
of the stopped-flow instrument.

Transfer of Pyrene and DG within a Lipoprotein Class
(Homogeneous Transfer). Rates of transfer of pyrene and
DG have been summarized for HDL, LDL, VLDL, VLDL,
YLDL,, and VLDL; in Table I. The reaction rates differed
considerably, ranging from 280 s" for transfer of pyrene be-
tween HDL to 10.8 s between VLDL.

Transfer of Pyrene between Dissimilar Lipoproteins
(Heterogeneous Transfer). The amount of information that
could be obtained was limited when the donor and acceptor
lipoproteins were the same, because transfer rates were in-
dependent of either the lipoprotein concentration or the probe
concentration: Consequently, transfer between donor and
acceptor lipoproteins of different density classes was investi-

gated. Pyrene-labeled LDL, HDL, and VLDL were used as
donor lipoproteins, with HDL, LDL, and HDL, respectively,
as unlabeled acceptors. The rates of transfer as a function
of donor and acceptor lipoprotein concentrations and probe
concentrations are shown in Tables II and IH.

The kinetic behavior of the probes in heterogeneous systems
was different from that found in homogeneous systems. The
observed rates of probe transfer in the heterogeneous systems
had intermediate values, compared to those found for transfer
between homogencous lipoproteins, and differed by 20-30%
over a 10-fold range of lipoprotein concentrations. There were
no changes in transfer rates with different pyrene concentra~
tions in the donor lipoproteins. However, the rate for transfer
between HDL and LDL measured by the increase in excimer
fluorescence was often faster than that determined by the
decrease in monomer fluorescence. While the Jp/fy ratio was
a linear function of probe concentration under all conditions
in a particular lipoprotein, differences in lipid and protein
compositions, as well as in organization of the nonpolar region
of the lipoproteins (Soutar et al., 1974), precluded quantitative
comparison of the changes in relative intensities of the excimer
and monomer fluorescence in different lipoproteins (Tachiya
& Almegren, 1981),

Reaction rates were predicted from the following kinetic
scheme for transfer of a probe molecule. This model assumes
a simple two phase system in which the lipoprotein is con-
sidered to be an immiscible organic phase in a continuous
aqueous phase:

ky ky
Pt Pa SP (10)

where P, is the donor lipoprotein with a concentration of
milliliters of L, per milliliter of solvent, P, is the acceptor
Hpoprotein with a concentration of milliliters of L, per milliliter
of solvent, and P,, is the probe in the aqueous solution.

* The kinetic equations are

dP, /dt = -k,P, + kyP og (i)

AP, /dt = —kyP, + kyPaq (2)

dP/dt = kyP, + kyPy — Chey + ka) Pag (13)

The equations had previously (Frost & Pearson, 1961a,b)

been considered to be independent. They are, in fact, linked
by conservation of mass:

PLL V + PoL:V + PV = Py (a)

where P, is the total mass of the probe and V is the volume
of solution.
Rearranging and substituting for P,, in eq 11 and 12 give

dP, /dét = ~[(ky + kyLy)Py + kakgP,] + koP/V (15)
AP, /dt = —[CkgLyP, + kg + kqla)P2) + EsP/V (16)
