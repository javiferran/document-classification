LIPID TRANSFER BETWEEN LIPOPROTEINS

longer than that observed in the absence of salt (Figure 1).

At 1 M concentrations, Na,SO, was more effective than
NaCl; the rates of transfer were 11- and 2-fold slower, re-
spectively, than that observed in standard buffer containing
0.15 M NaCl. Increasing concentrations of NaSCN had the
opposite effect; the rate of transfer was increased about 25%.
The salting-in~salting-out effects of various electrolytes and
their relative effectiveness in changing the solubility of non-
polar compounds in aqueous solution have been summarized
(Long & McDevit, 1952; Aquan-Yuan et al., 1979, and ref-
erences therein). In general, the experimental data fit the
empirical Setschenow equation

log (y/o) = log (So/S) = Kee, Q)

where yo and are the activity coefficients of the solutes in
water and electrolyte solution, respectively, Sp and S' are the
mole fraction solubilities of the solutes in water and electrolyte
solution, respectively, K, is the salting-out coefficient, and c,
is the molar concentration of the electrolyte solution.
Therefore, if the rate depends on the solubility of the trans-
ferring species in the solution, a plot of the logarithm of the
transfer rate of DG should be a linear function of the salt
concentration. With the salts tested, such a relationship was
found (Figure 1).

The effects of neutral salts on hydrophobic interactions in
salting-out phenomena can be related quantitatively to the
nonpolar contact area of the interacting species and the molal
surface tension increment produced by the salt (Paul, 1952:
Melander & Horvath, 1977), Neutral salts increase the
surface tensions of aqueous solutions y in a linear fashion:

y= yt om (2)

where +’ is the surface tension of pure water, m is the molality
of the salt, and o is a constant, the molal surface tension
increment, It can be shown that there is a linear relationship
between the In (S/Sy) and ¢ (Melander & Horvath, 1977).
Similar treatment of the rates of transfer of DG between HDL
in the presence of these lyotrophic salts illustrated that a linear
relationship existed (data not shown).

Effect of Organic Solvents on the Rate of DG Transfer.
When labeled HDL were mixed with unlabeled HDL in so-
lutions that contained small amounts of organic solvents, the
transfer rates were faster than those observed in the absence
of solvent. For example, ethanol (10% v/v) increased the rate
of DG transfer 3-fold; in DMF (10% v/v), the rate was 8-fold
greater than that found in buffer alone.

Distribution Coefficients of DG and Pyrene between HDL
and Aqueous Solution. If the lipid region of a lipoprotein is
considered to be a water-immiscible phase, the solubilities of
the probes may be expressed in terms of a distributiion
coefficient between these two phases, the lipoprotein and the
aqueous solution, by the relationship

f= [Phig?/[Plip® (3)

where f is the distribution coefficient, [Pl.q” is the equilibrium
concentration of the probe in water, and [P],p” is the equi-
librium concentration of the probe in the lipoprotein. When
saturating amounts of the partitioning compound are present,
the distribution coefficient, f, is the ratio of the limiting sol-
ubilities of the compound in the two phases (Karger et al.,
1973).

The distribution coefficients of the fluorescent probes can
be measured directly by sequential dilution of the labeled
lipoprotein. A lipoprotein solution is chosen with a lipoprotein
concentration sufficiently high that the fluorescent probe is
associated aimost entirely with the lipoprotein and the

fluorescence of the probe in the aqueous solution is negligible.
The ratio of excimer to monomer fluorescence measured for
the initial solution is designated (g/Fu)®. The lipoprotein
solution is then diluted sequentially until (fp/Iy,)°/ af In)"
is approximately 2, where 1 is the number of dilutions. Since
the total amount of probe P, present is constant, then

P. = [Pluptip + [Plage ~ exp) (4)

The volume of lipoprotein per milliliter of solution, vzp, is
[LP]/p x 10° L/L, where [LP] is the lipoprotein concen-
tration in milligrams per milliliter and p is its density in grams
per milliliter (Lindgren et al., 1972). Therefore

Pr = [(LP)/p X 10°) [Php + [Plaqhaq (5)

where v,, is the volume of solution. At a much higher con-
centration, [LP]°, the amount of probe in the aqueous com-
partment can be ignored, so that

P.= ((LPI/p X 10°)[Phip + [Phiofloy (6)

Prior to dilution, the amount of the probe in the aqueous
solution is negligible so that

Pos PP = (ILP}°/p X 10°) [P].p°? (7)

Dividing eq 6 by eq 7, rearranging, and remembering that,
for a fixed mass of lipoprotein, the product of [LP]v,, is
constant gives

[Plip?/[P]ie" = 1 + (of + 10°)/[LP} (8)

Since Ip/Iy, is a measure of probe concentration in the lipo-
protein, then

ignoring the monomer fluorescence of the aqueous probe,

An example of this analysis is shown in Figure 2. On the
basis of eq 9, a plot of (Up/Iy)°/(le/Iy)" against 1/[ipe-
protein] gives a line, from the slope of which fcan be obtained.
