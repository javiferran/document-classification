Models were completed the week of April 25 to evaluate paper
filter components from Baumgardner Papiers and Intertaba. Gas
phase analysis is complete for cigarettes from POL test 0125 (CA

filter) and 0126 (paper/CA).

CR chemicals continue to be subjectively evaluated. CR 2673 -
Glucovanillin - is presently under evaluation as a vanillin
release compound. CR 2643 - Coumarnin substitute - is presently
under consideration fior phase III. Several new casings and
afitercuts have been developed and are being used in Projects Art

and Trim.

Results of the 9th month storage study of Super Juice II indicate
little change in the organic components: at room temperature.
Subjective smokings of the 9+month oldi product vs. freshly made
product show no significant difference in aromatic profiles.
