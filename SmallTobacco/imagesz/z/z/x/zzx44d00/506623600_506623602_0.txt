e@ On October 29, the Senate approved by voice vote an amendment to the.
FY 1988 Transportation Appropriations bill that would prohibit smoking — .
on commercial airline flights of 1 1/2 hours or less for a period of
two years. This amendment was substituted for Senator Lautenberg’s_
proposal to ban smoking on flights of two hours or less for a period
of three years. Earlier this year, the House approved an amendment to
its version of the FY 1988 Transportation Appropriations bill that
would prohibit smoking on flights of two hours or less for an
unlimited period of time. The two bills will now go to a conference
committee where the differences between the bills’ smoking provisions
will be resolved. ,

e On October 29, the House approved its budget reconciliation bill by a
vote of 206 to 205. The bill raises $12.8 billion in new revenues
without increasing excise taxes on cigarettes or denying deductions
for tobacco product advertising and promotion expenses. The Senate is
expected to consider its version of the reconciliation bill next week.
Simultaneous to this action in_the House and Senate are the daily
meetings of the budget summit between the Administration and Congress.
Even if we survive in the House and Senate budget reconciliation bills
without a cigarette tax increase, we could still be vulnerable to an
excise tax hike if the budget summit recommends revenues above that in
the reconciliation bills.
