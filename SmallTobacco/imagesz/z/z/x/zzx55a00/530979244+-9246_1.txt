Letter of Authorization
Dear Mr. Clark:

Picase accept this letter as official notification that R.J. REYNOLDS TOBACCO COMPANY ("RJR")
intends to enter into a formal agreement (the "Agreement") with FORMAL SYSTEMS, INC. (“FSI’)
whereby RJR will employ the services of FSI to re-engineer certain of RJR’s data processing application
programs, currently written in the Natural computer language, to identify and remedy ycar 2000 date
defects, The Agreement will be patterned after the offer dated December 10, 1996 (that was modificd on
December 16, 1996) received by RJR from FS] in the form of a proposed agreement (the “Offer”).

This letter shall serve as authorization for FSI to begin the work described in the Offer with the
understanding that the details and scope of that work, payment terms and other provisions of the
Agreement have yet to be refined. While we certainly can continue negotiations toward formal contract
language for the Agreement, because of the enormity of the project on which we need your assistance, the
time length of our commitment to cach other and the costs involved, the RJR formal approval process
cannot be completed until after the first of the new year. We will then be duly authorized to sign the
Agreement once we reach agreement on all its provisions.

After this letter is signed by both parties, we will honor your invoice for the first of the payments listed in
the Offer in the amount of $250,000.00. Please date that invoice for December 31, 1996. In the event the
Agreement is entered into, the full amount of this $250,000.00 payment will be applicd toward the
payments required by the Agreement. No other payments will be made pursuant to this letter. This letter
will expire at 11:59 P.M. on January 31, 1997. In the event this letter expires before the Agreement is
entered into or RJR has to terminate it because those RJR officers empowered to authorize this transaction
decline to do so, FSI may keep that part of the $250,000.00 payment that will reasonably compensate FSI
for the work it performs pursuant to this leticr, including a reasonable profit, up to the date of the expiration
or termination, The balance will be returned to RJR. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to arrive
at a just and equitable compensation for FSI to keep. In this regard, FSI agrees to permit RJR to review that
portion of FSI’s books and records pertaining to FSI's work pursuant to this letter if RJR so requests.
Return to RJR of the remainder of the payment will be made within 30 days after agreement on how much
FS is to retain.
