Ms. Ellen Monahan:

Subject: RJRT USA Presentation to L. V. Gerstner

As promised yesterday, here are the broad suggestions for my part
of the presentation.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

This should be limited to a maximum of one-half hour
presentation. Areas may overlap with Ralph Angiuoli’s.
Nevertheless, efforts should be made to over simplify. Wherever
possible, data should be presented in diagrammatic form rather
than tables (e.g., bar charts, graphs, pie charts were relevant).

A. Show industry decline over last ten years. Project out for
next three. Indicate major events which have influenced the
decline (e.g., FET increase, etc.).

B. Illustrate main segment performance. Segments here should
be limited to simple product segments and consumer
demographic segments (e.g., size, flavor, box versus soft,
men and women, and age groups).

Cc. Show each company’s performance (by share of market) over
the last ten years and projecting out over the next three.

D. Draw simple profile of each company in terms of individual
brand portfolios (with individual shares). Suggest we limit
to top three brands in each case with all others combined.
Indicate company areas of strength and weakness in terms of
areas of growth. Refer these where relevant to market
dynamics such as segment performance.

~
By

Indicate each company’s spending, both in total and by major
brand (top three only plus all others combined) .

Profile each company in business terms (e.g., ownership,

~ profitability, sha £f tobacco as part jof total earnings,
international and domestic tobacco, other businesses and
stivities, etc.).. ©

activities, etc.).
