Identify three key issues (problems and opportunities facing

each tobacco company).

G. Focus on RJR and profile with particular focus. on major
issue facing the company which will affect our marketing
planning. This will lead directly into the marketing plan
itself and should be, therefore, phrased in marketing terms.

1989 MARKET PLAN !

Key Issue

The key issue facing RJR is not an industry issue, but a
corporate issue. We have a declining share of market combined
with an excessive and expensive load.
In a declining industry if both of these are Inot addressed, our
earnings and cash flow potential are in jeopardy.

Reasons for the Key Issue

RJR has not for the last seven years been marketing driven, but
rather has focused on volume and quarterly performance.

Our focus, therefore, has been short term and tactical rather
than strategic. This has affected the way we have invested our
funds, the brands we have supported, the way |we have supported
them, and the quality of our product. In the case of the latter,
we have been more concerned with cost savings than with investing
in quality.
We have not focused our marketing and sales investment in growth
segments or in areas of existing and potential strength.

In all the above areas, the major competitor, Philip Morris, has
been more strategically effective and has grown at our expense.

Marketing Objectives

1. Stabilize consumer share in 1989 and grow it from 1990 on,
thereby managing effectively a volume decline in the
domestic organization which is controllable and less than
the industry decline overall.

2. Position our company and its brands for future anticipated
market changes as exemplified by possible marketing
restrictions, increasing importance of the retail arena, and
changing consumer product preference.
