3. Elements in the Plan: |

a. The Plan itself. Different from previous years.
Addresses problems. Portfolio approach establishes
business roles for each brand. Positions the company
for the future.

b. Present summary of each brand’s role and plan in the
following order of importance.

(1) WINSTON (stabilization)
(2) SALEM (growth potential
(3) CAMEL (growth potential)
(4) DORAL (growth potential)

(6) EXCEL (new brand) |
(7) CHELSEA (new brand) |
(8) NOW (growth potential)
(9) VANTAGE (stabilization)
(10) MORE (stabilization)

In presenting each of these brands, specific
characteristics of the Plan would be introduced as
appropriate (e.g., focus on young adults, integration
of all advertising and promotion communication,
increased spending against younger jadults and attention
to specific market opportunities such as Hispanic and
black. |

c. At the end of the brand reviews, an overall budget
summary should be shown, indicating how we are spending
funds against each brand and also against growth
opportunities (young adults, Hispanics, Blacks, etc.).

Ellen, I don’t expect you to put into the charts all the elements
I have described above. It is merely to give you a feel of the
flow as I see it. The main intent is to provide you with my

views on order of presentation. Please call me if anything needs
clarification.
