xc:

Warehouses receiving damaged product will have to recoup cases
with “Low Price" sticker cartons.

Please provide warehouse operations (Mr. Gary Brooks) a sample
carton with the "Low Price" sticker in the correct position.
This sample will instruct the warehouses where to sticker
cartons.

Please note the following flat stock carton estimated production
capabilities by packing and the associated carton value for each
brand:

Carton Required

Brand 6M Cases Value Stickers
* Mav 85 mm 566 $ 3,806 17,800
* Mav 100 mm 250 §$ 2,572 7,900
* Mav Box 80 mm 158 $ 1,764 5,000
* Mav Lt 85 mm 433 § 4,144 13,600
* Mav Lt 100 mm 416 § 4,060 13,100
* Mav Lt Box 80 mm 733 $ 6,962 23,000
Total 2,556 $23,308 80,400

* If the above cartons are to be manufactured into finished
goods, it is manufacturing’s recommendation to make the
above brands with no production codes and place into freezer
storage. The "Low Price" stickers would then be placed on
all packing.

* Therefore, the new grand total requirement for “Low Price”
stickers would be 516,500.

* The estimated cost to place stickers on the above flat stock
cartons is $12,000.
