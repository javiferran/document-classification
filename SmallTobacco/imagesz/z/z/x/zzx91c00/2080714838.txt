fornia Speedway.

Seven drivers unofficially bet-
tered. the existing mark Thursday
afternoon in a practice session; led
by Kurt Busch in a Ford. His run
of 177848 mph in 40.484 seconds
topped the 173.561 mph, 41.484

Houston, who will move into the
NASCAR Winston Cup Series
along with Busch next year, was
second fastest. He. pushed his
Chevrolet around the track in
41.045 seconds at 175.417 mph:

Others. who went faster than
Houston’s record were Dennis Set-
zer and-David Starr, the fastest of
the Dodges, and the Fords driven
by Mike Wallace, Greg Biffle and

_ Rick Crawford.

“Our strategy is to finish second
in points,” said Busch, who's bat-
thing for the spot along with Hous-
ton and Wallace. “We are planning
to stay as close to the front as we
can and put a conservative setup
on it where we can be comfortable
in the draft.

“Then we will just work on hang:
ing oat with the No. 60 (Houston)
and No. 2. (Wallace) trucks.”,

Houston said his’ team made a
mock run at the pole.

“The truck is running pretty
well,” said Houston, who's won the
last two NCTS poles at Fontana. “I
think we have a real good shot at
trying to sit on the pole. This being
my last truck race, it would be good

_ to go out a winner.” .

ORIVER INJURED: Rick Ware hit the
“wail in tum two. during practice and. was
transported to Loma Linda Uniwersity' Med-
gai Center after treatment in the infield fa-
city.

onds and 162.418 mph, was to be held
overnight for observation and additional
tests.
