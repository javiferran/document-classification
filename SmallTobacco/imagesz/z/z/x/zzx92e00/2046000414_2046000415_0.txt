- PHILIP MORRIS COMPANIES INC, _ INTER-OFFICE

CORRESPONDENCE
120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10017-5592

To: Hans Storr Date: September 1, 1993
From: Barry Holt
Subject: Media Request -- CAPITAL (France)

As you'll remember from my previous memo, Eric Wattez, a
reporter with the French business monthly Capital, is writing a
cover story on Philip Morris Companies Inc. He would like to
interview you sometime between September 9-15 or after
September 20.

Background:

ital is the leading French economic/business magazine. It is
published by the Prisma Group and has ties with the German
group, Gruener & Jahr, which publishes the German edition of
Capital.

The French Capital was introduced in October 1991 and met with
immediate success. It surpassed the then-leading French economic

monthly, L'Expansion. Today, Capital's circulation has reached
almost 300,000.

Capital employs somewhat unusual angles: it tries to ‘humanize’
its stories, making the economy and business readable and
appealing to everybody.

Capital normally devotes one 5 to 6 page story to a large company
which is in the news because of its success (or failure.) Mr. Wattez
is preparing such a story on PM -- as an example of success. He
has already interviewed Walter Thoma (President, EC), Michael
Horst (EC) and Ray Viault (Jacobs Suchard). He has also seen PM
sponsorship in action by attending the Monaco Formula 1 Grand
Prix.
