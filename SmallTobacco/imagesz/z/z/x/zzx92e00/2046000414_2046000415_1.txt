Wattez would also like to visit one of PM's tobacco facilities,
perhaps Richmond, while he is in the U.S.

PM EC strongly endorses this interview. Darienne Dennis will
follow up with your office to arrange a convenient time. (We'll be

following shortly with the details of the Handelsblatt interview as
well.)

Wattez' questions to Hans Storr follow:

- How was the price cut of Marlboro really decided?

- How do you analyze the impact of this decision so far?

- Did you expect such a strong reaction from the stock market?

- Could you explain how the team of top managers at PM work:
collective decision, delegation, etc...

- The balance of power at the headquarters between "cigarette
people" and "food people."

- About the buying campaigns: what are the cash reserves of PM
(it is sometimes said you could buy Pepsi Cola without any
problem!)

- The future: will the food sector definitely become the core
business of PM? To which extent?
