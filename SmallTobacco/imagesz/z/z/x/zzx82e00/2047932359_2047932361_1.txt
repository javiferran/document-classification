GEOGRAPH
o Sales reps with inner city territories in twenty markets (list

attached) plus Military managers will receive these materials.
The markets were chosen based on a weighted average of B&H SDI,
B&H Menthol SDI and percentage of Black population. These were
the same markets used in the 1989 B&H Inner City program.
Military bases will be added to the 1990 program given their high
concentration of Black consumers.

ALLOCATIONS
o Each sales rep will receive 12 displays, posters and sell sheets.
However, reps in those areas of highest B&H volume contribution
(top 8 markets) will be given extra incentives to re-stock their

displays.
