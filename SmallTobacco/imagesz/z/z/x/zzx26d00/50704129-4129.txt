RE: Case number 6293

Dear Dr. Sealock:

Your recent inquiry concerning support by this Council of a
proposed research project has now been considered by the Executive
Committee of the Scientific Advisory Board.

The Committee expressed interest in examining a more detailed plan
of the proposed investigations. I take pleasure in enclosing the
necessary forms and relevant literature pertaining to the filing of a
formal application. The next deadline for submitting proposals is May
31, 1996.

You understand, of course, that no commitment is implied at this

time concerning the final action of our full Scientific Advisory Board on
the complete proposal.

Sincerely yours,

Aid svat
