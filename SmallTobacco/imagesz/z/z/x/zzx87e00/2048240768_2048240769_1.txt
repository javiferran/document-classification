Additionally, he has also asked questions about our advertising in
Penthouse magazine, how many new Marlboro smokers we got as a
result of the 1993 price reduction, RICO statutes investigation, and
children and smoking.

What other issues could he bring up? His main interests are tobacco,
kids and health. So, support to kids organization (whether through a
grant or matching gift), nicotine manipulation, and sports marketing,
which he says would be directed at kids, all could be on his list. There
has been a number of articles and TV programs on pregnant women,
miscarriages, SIDS and smoking, and Blum may latch on to that issue.
Sometimes he'll come up with something that is completely laughable,
as he did when the Clarence Thomas hearings were being conducted.
He asked Mike Miles, given our significant support to minority groups,
did PM intend to establish the Clarence Thomas Fund.

How should we respond to him? I don't know what Burson is preping
him on, but personally I would prefer not engaging Blum in a debate,
especially if he asks something really off the wall, like the Clarence
Thomas comment. He sometimes asked multiple questions, to which I
think Geoff might say "one to a customer to give everyone a chance;
you can get at the end of the line . . . " However, he does exaggerate
often and Mike had not always challenged his (and others) absurd or
outright false comments about our products or business practices,
prefering instead to brush him aside and keep the meeting moving
along.
