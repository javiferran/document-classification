Heard from Todd; this is in the works, he is currently working on it. Same as last year,
two coupons. I'm still trying to get an answer from Camel.

Todd, do you know if any planning has taken place on the 97 mail kits for the two races
in Florida where we will be doing personal selling?

Last year the Winston Kit was a letter about the race, and two coupons. Both expired
12/31/96 - one was for $3 off 4 packs or 1 carton, and the other was a B1GIF. Lindsay's
group provided a paragraph about the race to Brenda Granderson in Consumer Relations
and she incorporated the paragraph into a letter. The letter was actually run on legal-size
paper, with the two coupons as tear-offs on the bottom of the letter. I have a sample of the
paper, coupons, and cnyclope uscd. Included with the letter was a survey about future
purchase intent.

Do you know who is in charge of planning for the mail kit this year? New coupons will
have to be printed, and the survey may need to be revised.

Pls let me know. Thanks.
