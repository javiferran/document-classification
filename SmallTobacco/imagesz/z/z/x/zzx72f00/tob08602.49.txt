Dear Ms. Blaunstein:

We have received our shipment of "Helping Youth Decide," and wish
to thank you for your prompt and generous response. We have
already begun to distribute this brochure to a community group
that is holding a Family Life Institute soon. In March, we will

be distributing to parents who will be attending our Parent
Networks Conference. This is just a beginning. We will surely
share the opinions of others about the brochure | as we become aware

of them.

For ourselves, it produces a very positive reaction. The material
is very pertinent to our programs and “constituents.” It is
intelligently and attractively presented. We are enthusiastic about
distributing this quality brochure.

I hope we will be able to contact you again once our supply is
depleted.

Sincerely,

Att ab deher beck

Anita L. Schanback
Project Coordinator, Parent Networking
