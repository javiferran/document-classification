Restaurant ban

The Honolulu City Council is
on the verge of doing the right
thing by banning ing from
public restaurants in Honolulu,

Council members should not
be swayed by arguments that
the dan will hurt business ‘or
unfairly discriminate against the
rights of smokers.

First, the economic argument:

Hotel and restaurant owners
and operators are rightfully
worried about a decline in
business {7 the ban goes into

 
    
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

without imposing yet another
reason for folke not to patronize
their establishments.

The fact is, however, that
there is virtually no credible
evidence that smoking bans
hurt business in restaurants.
Indeed, in city after'city,
reputable studies of: tax receipts
and other data have suggested
that, if anything, business
improves when the ban is in
place, : .

That makes sense. If a
majority of us do not smoke, az
is the case, then a regulation
that appeals to the majority of
customers should have a
positive impact.

Honolulu is in an even
stronger position than other
cities. In California, for
instance, there is always the
potential for smoking customers
to drive across county lines
until they find a place where
they can light up in a
Testaurant. That wan't be
possible here. .

A more subtle argument is
the impact of such a ban on
foreign visitors, particularly
Japanese and Europeans who
are more likely to be smokers
than domestic customers.

Will they choose not to come
here once they know they can't
smoke while eating? Doubtful. -
Travel decisions are made on -
much larger issues than this. If
Hawaii has to hang its hopes on
attracting Japanese visitors on
the issue of restaurant smoking,
it is in bigger trouble than we
think,

Then there is the issue of
discrimination. It's true that the
ban would inconvenience

There is one illogical element
te the proposed ban. It would
not apply to bars and
nightclubs, If the health
argument is persuasive in
restaurants, why not in bars?

The answer is pragmatics.
Nightclubbing, drinking and
smoking seem to be
inextricably linked, The :
proposed law simply concedes
on that point.

Why couldn't the Council
extend this logic and perhaps
create a special category
all-smoking restaurant? If some
entrepreneur believed he could
make money selling food in an
establishment devoted
exclusively to smokers, perhaps
he should be allowed the
opportunity.

It's hard to see where he
would get workers or
customers, however.
