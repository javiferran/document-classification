Dear Store Manager:

For the past year, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has been actively seeking
support from the retail community in its fight to reduce underage smoking.
Since August of 1992, RJR has sent materials (literature as well as in-store
signage) on its youth non-smoking program, "Support The Law...It Works," to
over 20,000 retail outlets across the country. Over half of these stores have
requested additional material and information about the program.

In addition, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has had the privilege of having
Mr. Danny Glover, actor and parent, visit several cities, including New
Orleans, and speak to retailers about the importance of supporting this
age-restriction program.

It is my understanding that you may not be aware of this program so I am
sending a brochure that will provide you with pertinent information and what
materials are available. If you are already participating in the "Support The
Law" program, or something similar, thank you for your involvement. If you
are not participating in this program and would like to know more about it,
please review the brochure and send in for additional material using the
attached business reply card. All materials are available free of charge.

Thank you for helping us keep cigarettes out of the hands of kids. Remember,
when we all support the law...it works!

Sincerely,
ld Larch A
