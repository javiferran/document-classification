SL) ws ‘made from common-lot raw stems, 50/50 burley/flue-cured,
Sos processed by both Macon and Benelux.

2) wrs made from common-lot raw stem, £1ue-cured only, processed
by B&W in the Development Center and BAT — UK&E.

3) WIS made from common-lot raw stem, flue-cured only, processed
Se by B&W in the Development Center, and WD&HO Wills - Australia.

appear to indicate improvement over B&W standards.
