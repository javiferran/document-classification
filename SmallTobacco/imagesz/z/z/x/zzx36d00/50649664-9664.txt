ABSTRACT A number of eukaryotic viruses have evolved
mechanisms to downregulate activity of the interferon-
induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (re-
ferred to as P68 based on its Af, of 68,000 in human cells). This
control is essential because once activated, the P68 kinase
phosphorylates its natural substrate, the a subunit of the
eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 (eIF-2), limiting
functional eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 avail-
able for protein synthesis initiation, We have previously shown
that influenza virus encoded a specific mechanism to repress
the autophosphorylation and activity of P68. Using in vitro
assays for P68 inhibition, we now have purified, to near
homogeneity, the P68 repressor from influenza virus-infected
cells. The purified product inhibited both the autophosphory-
lation of P68 as well as phosphorylation of the a subunit of
eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 by the kinase.
We tested for both protease and phosphatase activity but found
neither activity associated with the purified inhibitor. Surpris-
ingly we found the purified repressor, which had an apparent
M, of ~58,000, was a cellular and not a viral-encoded protein.
Possible mechanisms by which influenza virus activates this
cellular regulator of the protein kinase, thereby minimizing
potential antiviral effects of interferon, are discussed.

 

To avoid decreases in protein synthetic rates during infec-
tion, animal viruses have devised strategies to downregulate
activity of the interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-
activated protein kinase (referred to as P68 from its M, of
68,000 but also referred to by others as DAI or Pl/elP-2
kinase) (1-4). The P68, a serine/threonine kinase, is charac-
terized by two distinct kinase activities: the first involves an
autophosphorylation (activation) reaction, and the second
involves a protein kinasc activity on exogenous substrates (5,
6). The virus-induced contro! of P68 is essential because
viral-specific RNAs synthesized during infection have the
potential to activate the P68 kinase (7-11). Once activated,
P68 phosphorylates its natural substrate, the @ subunit of
protein synthesis eukaryotic initiation factor 2, e1F-2. Phos-
phorylation of the efF-2 a subunit blocks the ell*-2B-
mediated exchange of GDP in the inactive eIF-2-GDP com-
plex with GTP required for catalytic utilization of eLP-2
(12-14}, These events lead to limitations in functional elF-2,
which is an essential component of protein synthesis initia-
tion and is normally required to bind initiator Mct-tRNA (via
the ternary complex eI F-2-GTP_-Met-tRNA) to the initiating
ribosomal subunit before MRNA is bound (14).

The regulation of P68 is best understood in the adenovirus
system primarily because of the characterization of the
adenovirus mutant 4/331 (16). During infection by the di331

mutant, which is deficient in the synthesis of the adenovirus-
encoded RNA polymerase II] product, virus-associated
RNA 1, all protein synthesis is blocked due to the activation
of P68 and phosphorylation of eIF-2 a subunit (17-22), We
demonstrated that virus-associated RNA 1 functioned to
block the activation of the kinase by forming a complex with
P68 (17). In contrast to adenovirus, both reovirus and vac-
cinia viruses appear to downregulate P68 by encoding gene
products that may bind to and sequester the double-stranded
RNA activator of the kinase (23-25). Poliovirus has devised
yet another strategy to minimize the damaging effects of
kinase activation: early after virus infection the kinase is
significantly degraded (7). Finally, we recently have shown
that the human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 may mediate
downregulation of the protein kinase via action of the raz gene
product (26).

The first indication that influenza virus encoded mecha-
nisms to regulate P68 came from studies analyzing cells
doubly infected with influenza virus and the adenovirus
mutant di331. When mutant di331-infected cells were super-
infected with influenza virus, dramatic suppression of the
protein kinase activity normally detected during mutant
infection was observed (27). We then reported a similar
suppression of kinase activity in cells infected by influenza
virus alone (28). In the present report we describe the
purification and characterization of an unusual P68 repressor
from influenza virus-infected ceils. The inhibitor, which was
purified by using in vitro P68 inhibition assays, was unex-
pectedly found to be a cellular and not a viral protein.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cells and Virus. The Madin—Darby bovine kidney (MDBK)
cells (29) and the adenovirus type 5 human embryonic cell
line 293 (30) were grown in monolayers as described (28). The
WSN strain of influenza virus was grown and titrated as
earlier described (29).

Purification of the P68 Inhibitor. Monolayers of MDBK
cells (2 x 10" cells; 800 T150 flasks) were infected with
influenza virus at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of ~10
plaque-forming units per cell for 4 hr. The infected cells were
washed twice with ice-cold Hanks’ balanced salt solution and
lysed in buffer A: 50 mM Tris‘HCl, pH 7.5/50 mM KCI/1 mM
dithiothreitol/2 mM MgCl./aprotinin at 100 zg per ml/1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/1% Triton X-100. The cyto-
plasmic extracts were then centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1
hr in a Beckman Ti 70.1 rotor. The supernatant (S100) was
fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (40-60%).
‘The ammonium sulfate precipitate was resuspended in butter
