Interferons and 2-5A Expression in Alzheimer’s Disease Fibroblasts . Joseph M. Wu, Phd

CRITIQUE. The author has made the intriguing observation that the 40 kD form of 2-SA
synthetase is not found in fibroblasts from 5 familial AD cases. Certainly the problem of
AD is a major one and any clue as to pathogenesis is welcome. The observations made
seem solidly based and a preprint which will appear in PNAS is provided which buttresses
the claims made. How generalizable is the observation? The sole case of sporadic AD
studied did not show the abnormality. Were all 5 familial AD samples from the same
kindred? If so, do other families with AD show the same defect? There is reason to
believe that different AD kindreds may well have different genetic abnormalities. How
specific is it for AD among degenerative diseases of the CNS? There are several loose ends
here.

It is fair to say that progress during the current granting period has been
satisfactory. This reviewer has no problems with the experiments proposed. The approach
is highly focused and the hypothesis proposed is circumspect and testable. Wu may well
be onto something. The problem I have is the generalization based on 5 nes of
fibroblasts.

RECOMMEND: Approval. Good enthusiasm.
