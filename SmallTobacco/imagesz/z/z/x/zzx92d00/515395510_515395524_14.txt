nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, and hippocampus in rat brain. The
synthesis, release and metabolism of dopamine were increased in the nucleus

accumbens. Norepinephrine synthesis was enhanced in the hypothalamus and
hippocampus.

b. The effects of nicotine were blocked by known antagonists of nicotine
receptor function, and thus were receptor-mediated.

c. Chronic pre-treatment of rats with nicotine affected only the response
in hippocampus. Synthesis was enhanced in this region.

Dr. Gray cited RJRT in 3 manuscripts and 4 abstracts during 1988.

8. Host Annual Meeting of funded extramural nicotine research programs.
(Fall 1988)

The annual Biobehavioral Conference on Sponsored Nicotine Research was held
Dec. 12-13, 1988. The conference consisted of presentations by the
principal investigators as part of the RJRT R&D Seminar Series and detailed
presentations to the Biobehavioral Division on the current status and
future directions of their respective programs. The participants included
Dr. J. Langone (Baylor College), Drs. G. Lunt and S. Wonnacott (University
of Bath), Dr. A. Collins (University of Colorado), Dr. S. Deadwyler (BGSM),
Dr. J. Gray (University of London, U.K.), and Drs. R. Jensen, D. Gilbert
and C. Meliska (Southern Illinois University).

Dr. Peter Dews (Harvard University) attended as a representative of the
Scientific Advisory Board. A summary report of the conference is in
