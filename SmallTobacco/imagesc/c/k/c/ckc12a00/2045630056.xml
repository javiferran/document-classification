MERIT IMAGE PROFILE
• Low Tar Seeker brands have poorly defined and often negative images.
• Merit has the best image of Low Tar Seeker brand, but it's still thin and vague. A
quitter's brand.
• Flavor Seeker brands are more clearly defined, masculine in image and viewed as
popular.

- Relaxation
- Food Cues
- Personal Identification
- Product Focus

Within these positioning directions, six new product concepts were evaluated:
NEW PRODUCT CONCEPTS NAME
3 mg that tastes like 5 mg Bolds
Low Smokes/Low Odor Easy's
Shorts (72 mm) Shorts
'Bama's
Slow Smokes (lasts 50% longer) Slow Smokes
European blend Euro

Roasted flavor 'Spresso
The first three have been developed and were sampled in the groups.
The last three were exposed in concept form only.

STAGE II CONCLUSIONS
Stage II validated:
• the attitudinal segmentation
• that Flavor Seekers and Low Tar Seekers are prime prospects for Merit when the brand's image is well
defined as flavorful.
• that the current image of Merit is thin compared to Flavor Seeker brands.
Stage II also confirmed that positioning Merit as more flavorful through the use of masculine imagery can be very
effective in developing a personality that attracts Flavor Seekers and Low Tar Seekers, particularly men.
The name Bolds fits well with the positioning. When the positioning was connected to a new product concept of
higher flavor/low tar (i.e. 3 mg tar/5 mg flavor), the positioning was even more appealing. However, other names
that would heighten interest among women should be explored.

S
STAGE II CONCLUSIONS
(CONTINUED)
Stage II also pointed to a second positioning that has promise.
Low Smoke/Low Odor, when placed in the context a friendly, social situation was very
appealing to both Flavor Seekers and Low Tar Seekers, particularly women.
While the name Easy's was accepted by many respondents, other names should be
explored for this positioning.
Shorts prompted concerns about value.
- 'Spresso was well received, but not to the extent higher flavor/low tar and low smoke/low
odor was.
- Product focused positionings did not generate a lot of interest.
OVOQMM 34
Kane, Bortree &amp; Associates, Inc.
pgNbr=35
•
NEXT STEPS
• "Higher Flavor/Low Tar"
Explore a variety of treatments in visual and verbal imagery,
alternate names to Bolds and language to express
the higher flavor/low tar product.
Develop alternate treatment that seek to attract women
without losing appeal among men.
•
• "Low Smoke/Low Odor"
- Explore a variety of treatments of "social/friendly/thoughtful" positioning.
- Included in this exploration develop imagery that seeks to
appeal to men as well as women.
• 4 focus groups - Flavor Seekers &amp; Low Tar Seekers:
November 20 and 30
Philadelphia
- Evaluate "Higher Flavor/Low Tar" and "Low Smoke/Low Odor" positionings.
