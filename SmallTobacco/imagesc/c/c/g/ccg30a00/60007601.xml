<ot>Twin Sees Herself Stymied
f
ByGINA KOLATA
Y most objective meas-
ures. Dr. Julie A. Swain is,
like her twin sister, a stun-
ning success.
She is the chief of cardiovascular
surgery at the University of Nevada
School of Medicine, a member of a
Food and Drug Administration com-
mittee that evaluates new devices, a
member of an Agency for Health
Care Policy committee that devel-
ops medical practice guidelines and
a member of the Defense Depart-
ment's peer-review committee for
quality assurance.
A decade ago, when she was at
Louisiana State University, she was
the first woman to be chief of cardi-
ac surgery at an American medical
school. And, like her sister, she
evokes effusive praise from col-
leagues.
Bht Dr. Swain is bitter about her
career. She, like her sister, wants to
be the best, and the best, to her, is a
position as chief of cardiology at a
major medical center, something no
woman has yet achieved. "I'm chief
of cardiology at a very small medi-
cal school," she said.
Her failure to reach her goal is not
for lack of hard work. Dr. Swain
• typically works from 6:30 in the
morning until 9 at night. She is di-
vorced vorced and has no children, and she
lives and breathes surgery.
And, apparently, it is not for lack
of talenL Dr. Michael DeBakey, the
eminent heart surgeon at Baylor
University in Houston, said she
"meets what I would regard as the
highest requirements."
Dr. Swain "is very industrious and
very devoted to her career and very
able," he added. "I think she has the
ability to succeed at the very top."
But Dr. Swain believes that the top
positions are essenttally closed to
women. If advancement were just
based on "hard work and how good
you are, it would be wonderful," she
said. Women surgeons say it is much
harder for them to get jobs, and
when they do get positions as sur-
geons, Dr. Swain added, they find it
hard to get patients. She explained
that surgeons are dependent on re-
ferrals for patients, and many doc-

tors will not send their patients to a
female heart surgeon.
"There probably wili be a woman
Prestdent before there is a woman
chief of surgery at a major medical
school," she said.
Dr. Stephen E. Hpstein, chief of
cardiology at the National Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute in Bethes-
da, 1id., who has worked with Dr.
Swain, said she is an "excellent car-
diac surgeon" and that "she did a
superb job" at the heart institute. ,
But he agrees that heart surgery "is
a very hard field to get into as a
woman."
Dr. DeBakey was reluctant to say
that a hostile climate toward women
had kept Dr. Swain and other able
women from the top ranks. There
are few such positions and many
talented surgeons, he said. "Some-
times it's just related to what oppor-
tunities are available," he said.
"Lady luck playS a role."
But Dr. Swain said that if she
could live her life over again, she
would steer clear of surgery_ "I
would probably do interventional
cardiology," she said.
