Subject: Regular Summary of Recent News and Editorial Comment
Press and public interest in tobacco developments remains high. Thousands
of local news stories, special columns and editorials have been appearing
since the release of the Advisory Committee's Report on Smoking and Health.
Generally, they cited reactions 1'rom local authorities, schools, health
agencies, civic groups, legislators and others. Specifically, they were
marked with speculation on possible courses of public, private and industry
action. Medical opinion and findings continue to get attention, and even
trivial developments were making major news. Print, wire service, radio
and television coverage has been extensive. This memorandum is limited
to the following recent developments.
1. Governor Tlerry Sanford of North Carolina in a speech to the National
:,..Association of 3bbacco Distributors in Miami, Florida, questioned
the finality of the Surgeon General's report. Besides press attention,
• many TV stations used excerpts from his talk. (pages 1-4)
2. The Federal Trade Commission in Washington is considering proposed
labeling restrictions with wide variety of comment. (pages 5-14)
3. Doctors continue to voice opinions on the Surgeon General's report.
(pages 15-38)
Results of smoking and health~studies at the sixth annual ACS sponsored
Science Writers' Seminar held in Palm Beach Shores, Florida. (pages 39-45)

Sanford Predicts
New Leaf Gains
MIAMIiBEACH, Fla. (AP) -
North Carolina Gov. Terry San-
ford made a prediction Monday
of "new levels of growth and
prosperity" for the tobacco iit-
dustty "once it~ is freed from the
clouds of health consideraGons"
by research into the cause of
cancer and heart disease.
Addressing the Nationall As,
sociation of Tobacco Distribu-
tors, Sanford said the govern,
ment report on smoking "raised
a lot:of questions but didn't find
the answers."
Sanford, governor of a state
that produces twothirds of the
nationss tobacc+o: challenged the
basis on which he, said "exces-
sively dedicalcd regulators"
were seeking to take tobacco
away from its users.
"What," he asked; "would
satisfy the psychological' needs
otAhe70: million Americans who smoked in 1963, if they were suddenly deprived of tobacco?"
Anti4moking campaigns of
today, he said, are being waged
"primarily with statistical cor-
relations of one kind or an-
other."
Declaring that the govern,
ment reporti "doesn't pin down
the condemnation of totiacco,"
he proposed a continuing study
of tobacco "to identify and
eliminate the suspected health,
risks," and a more intensive
study of cancer and heart ail-
ments.
Sanford said that since 1900
the annual death rate from ma-
jor lung ailments has fallen by
SA per cent, during a period
which cigarette smoking was on
the increase.
Sanford hit at what he called
incnn,stencies in the recent re-
port of the U.S. surgeon general
linkir.n; cigarette smoking and
lunR cancer.
"I dn notin any way discredit
the rcpart to the surgeon gen,anV' said! Sanford. ' But when
I am nsked if it doesn't pin
down Ibecondemnation of lo-
ba^co; nnce and for all,myansver is, emphatically, that iti
does not."
Faotord called attention to
statisical surveys not used by
the advisory committee and cit-
ed the incidence of lung cancer
in non-smokers.
He predicted the lob'acco in-
dustry would' attain new peaks
of orosperity "once it is freed
from the cloud of health consid-
erations by scientiGc research
and discovery into he basic
causes of cancer and disex;es
of the heart and respiratory
systems."
Sanford, who smokes an occa-
sional cigar, comes from a
state which produces most of
the nation's fliiecured tobacco
and manufactures 60 per cent
of its cigarettes.
He said' tobacco has been
plagued by health scares since
Sir Walter Raleigh first impcrt-
ed the leaf to England.
"Each century has had Its
dedicated forces," he stated,
"who were positive that the
world's ills could be traced to
tot.acco and that immortality
and the millenium would some-
how be achieved if tobacco
were abolished."
Sanford said the surgeon
general's report states that a
casual relationship cannot be
established by statistical meth-
ods, and yet "as far as I, can
determine, the report proceeds
to rely on statistics to arrive at
its conclusions which condemn
smoking:
"The further fact is that this
reportidoesnot specify any sub-
stance in tobacco smoke that
would account for, causing a dis-
ease;' Sanford added, "And
yet howmanypeop4e realize
this, among the millions of
Americans to whom the report
was conveyed as an official
finding on the smoking and
health question.
"I believe that most Ameri-

FRCK: Convention Headquarters, National Association of Tobacco Distributors,

FM IlWDIA!M REISASE
(NM M ]CDI'1Cfft:
Here is a 7t?-secoaid newsfi]sn of Governor Terry Sanford of lBorth Carolina. He
discussed sacking and health in a speech before the 32nd annual convention of the
National Association of Tobacco Distributors, now in session at Miami Beach, Fla.)
FGR AlEDUNM:
._2he I[ational Association of Tobacco Distributors -- whose 45-hundred members play
a]ey role in the 8-billion dollar tobacco industry -- is now in session at Miami
Beach,.Florida. Governor Terry Sanford of North Carolina discussed smoking and
health in a talk to the group.
I'd like you to clearly understand that I do not in any way discredit the Report
to the Surgeon General. •But when I am asked if it doesn't pin down the condemnation
of tobacco once and for all, my answer is, emphatically, no:
I'm ziot a scientist but it is beconing clearer every day that the Report is by
no means satisfactory to many doctors and scientists, either in its consideration of
questions concerning tobacco use or in its contributions to scientific understanding
of the diseases to which it addresses itself.
The further fact is that this Report does not specify any substance in tobacco
smake that vould account for causing a disease. And yet how many people realize
this, among the mi3lions of Americans to whom the Report was conveyed as an official
finding on the smoking and health problem.
The fundamental question remains. What causes cancer? No report has given
us the answer to that.

In its anti-smoking education'

the 5200 million the tobacco

He said the Society has
never taken a prohibitionist
stand on the sale or use of
cigarettes, and, believes in
freedom of choice of an in-
dividual's decision on whether
ornot to smoke.
"But' freedom does not

Malcolm L Fleischer, a
ptanaging director of the Re-
1 Tobacco Dealers of Amer-
ca, Inc., challenged the Com-
ioner's right to put its

Cigarette sales, Fleischer
ntended; are a "local" mat-
er and the FTC'proposed reg-

THE Federal Trade
1 appears to be engaging in an
exercise in futility, a possibly
fruitless controversy, and an al-
leged extension of its statutory au-
thority.
The Commission proposes that
each cigarette advertisement and
each pack, box, or carton bear a
warning that smoking is danger-
ous to health, In light of the long
delayed Public Health Service re-
port of Jan, 11 and the weight of
medical research, the requirement
would seem only logical.
But tobacco is big farming and
bigger business. Last year 503,733
American farms harvested 1,151,:
529 acres of tobacco of all types.
The estimated value of this crop
Ibn the farm market was $13 bil-
lion Tobacco is the 'ninth-ranking
farm commodity in sales. It is a
major cash~crop in 16 states.
The public spent about $8.1 bil-
lion for finished products in 1963.
About $3.3 billion was for state
($1.1 billion), federal ($2.1 billion),
and7ocal ($38'to $40 million) taxes,
About $1.8 billion to $2 billion rep-
resents the costs and profits of
shippers, wholesalers an&amp;retailers
factory. The $3 billion remainde
represents the value of tobacco
products FOB the factory-abou
80 per cent of this in cigarettes.
These data willi explain why the
Tobacco Institute will take the
stand that the Commission lacks
authority and that any advertising
controls are up ~ to Congress. The
question of new filtering develop-
ments has not been tested.
The futility comes in through ex-
perience and prophecy. In Britain,
where the government has been
conducting a tough anti-smoking
campaign, $2.6 billion worth of to-
bacco was sold in the first nine
months of 1963, as against $2.5
billion in the like period of, the
previous year.
In this country, smoking has in-
creased in the past seven consecu-
tive years, roughly paralleling the
period which produced numerous
anti-smoking scientific studies. The
Department of Commerce, which
understandably is hiding in a fox-
hole during the sharpshooting be.
tween industry and the FTC and'
PHS, predicts only a slightdecrease
in domestic consumption of tobac-
co this year.

that taken by the tobacco indus-

The AMA position, however,

the FTC plan has received
from:
-The health departments of
20 states, including New York,

FTC vs. CAMELS,, LUCKIES, ETC.
The fight between the cigaret industry and the Federal
Trade Commission -got under way in earnest in Washing-
ton laat week, and promises to continue for quite a spell.
FTC Chairman Paul R a n d Dixon
thinks his band of bureaucrats has power
to force the cigaret makers to decorate
their packages with warnings that the
contents are dangerous to health, and
may cause lung cancer:
The industry, as tnight be expected,
feels otherwise.
` So do we, and we wish the cigaret
lieople every success in their battle with
the FT(',-a battle which they intend to

We,hope, too, that the tobacco people and freedom-
loving citizens in general will fight to the. limit against
local persecutions such as New York City's current Health
Coqnmissioner, one George James, is trying to inflict on
cigaret makers, sellers and advertisers. .
Incidentally, THE NEws takes cigaret advertising,
L'kes it, would happily accept still more of it, and has no
apologies to offer for editorials such as this.
In the first place, there is no laboratory proof that
atnolCing cigarets ever gave 'a human being lung cancer or
any other disease-though admittedly cigarets should be
avoided or discontinued by victims of some diseases.
In the second place, if it is an FTC duty to force cigaret
makers to warn consumers.on health grounds, then it is an
FTC duty to decree similar warnings by producers of every-
thing else whose excessive use can harm one's health.
And in the third place, if the FTC makes this assault
on the cigaret industry stick, there will be no limit to
bureaucrats' extension of this type of meddling with Amer-
icans' private habits and personal preferences. •
In this bureaucratic and kjlljoy-doctor onslaught
against the cigaret, we are witnessing a revival of the old
apirit of federal prohibition. That' accursed law made life
in the United States something of a hell on earth for 13
years (192fl 33). See "How Dry We Were," by Henry Lee
of THE NEWS; Prentice-Hall, Englewood Ciiffs, N.J., 1963;
244 pages, $4.95.
The prohibition idiocy ought to be slapped, down, hard,
wbenever it rears it_9 nasty' head-and here's luck to th®.
tobacco industry in undertaking this latest slapdown.

EDITORIALS
T1me to take a stand
The cigarette-health controversy has st:rred up a consider-
able amount of nonsense and some questionable power
plays. Although the issues are complex, the matter has
reached the point where persons and media of integrity
should stand up and be counted. These are the issues, as
Pnuvrzes' Iaat sees them:
0 The Federal Trade Commission does not have the
authority to make rules that have the effect of laws,
whether they regulate the advertising of sleeping bags or
aga rr.ties. This has been Pp1NTEAS' INx s stand, stated fre-
quently, since the rule-making procedure was announced
in June 1962. This stand has nothing to do with cigarettes,
although the FTC is using the emotional and moral con-
siderations of smoking to support its usurpation of Con-
gressional powers.
7t is ironic that most of the advertising business couldn't
bother to be disturbed by the significance of the rule-making
` itself. The ad business had to wait until millions of dollars
.vere at stake before protesting the rule-making procedure.
It is also all too revealing, For example, the statement by
the Televis:on Bureau of Advertising that the FTC cannot
make rules and, besides, TV might lose $130-milliom in
~ cigarette ad revenues, smacks so patently of self'-interests
over public interest that it invites restrictions.
~ Proposals to increase cigarette taxes are the height of
Puritan hypocrisy. The taxes have not deterred smoking,
but they have enabled non-smokers to benefit at the expense
of smokers. They are inherently dishonest.
• There is no reasonable doubt of the link bet\.N•een
sirmlang and lung cancer and other serious ailments. It
folb.vs that anyone who encourages another to start
smoking or to smoke more than he now does is guilty of
an immoral act.
0 .4lns: c;garette advertising is immoral, because if en-
courages oourages people to start smoking or to smoke more. It refers
repeatedly to the pleasure and satisfaction of smoking,,
makes convoluted implications about the safety of brands,
and holds smokers up for emulhtion.
• The only kind of cigarette advertising that could be
morally acceptable would be brand-reminder advertis:ng
aimed solely at adult smokers and avoiding any theme
that would encourage people to smoke.
0 It would be in the best interests of the public and
of the advertising business if cigsirette advertisers and'
`
advertising media voluntarily restricted all cigarette adver-
tising to brand-reminder advertising. Otherwise, the respon-
sible leadership of the advertising business should request
that Congress impose such retrictions by law.

WALL STMT JOURNAL
Mbnday, March 16, 1964
REVIEW and OUTLOOK
Behina~ the gmmke screen
C
Whatever anyone may think about
the hazards of smoking, there are
some basic issues in the Government
involvement in the controversy. It is
we thing for Federal authorities to
spansor a report on smoking, quite an-
other for them to try to control the
babit.
First we are presented with a ludi-
crous spectacle: The Government
which would use one of its arms-the
Federal Trade Commission-to in-
crease its regulation of manufacturers
and advertisers is the same Govern-
ment which uses another arm-the
Agriculture Department-to subsidize
tobacco growers with price supports.
An attempt to abolish the subsidy was
recently defeated in Congress.
Though this leaves officialdom in
flat contradiction with itself, it does
indicate a more serious part of the
problem. The tobacco industry, from
grower right on through the whole
chain to retailer and consumer, is a
not insignificant element in the econo-
my. If the Government coul&amp; put an
effective crimp in it, it would be
menacing a lot of businesses and a lot
of jobs at a time when it is constantly
complaining about the rate of un-
employment.
It can be argued, to be sure, that
the perils are great enough to justify
the economic damage. But it is a re-
markably discriminatory argument.
Most experts concede that urban air
pollution, for example, probably poses
much the same perils, and efforts to
control it have not been notably suc-
cessfuL Should the Government there-
fore attempt to dismantle the indus-
tries that contribute to air pollution?
Then there is the question of the
FTC's legal authority in the matter.
The agzncy wants to require all cig-
aret advertising or labeling to warn
that cigaret smoking may cause death,
to avoid' any implication that it pro-
inotes good health or physical well-
being' and to make no claim that any
one brand is less harmful than an-
other.
At hearings scheduled to begin this
morning, however, a number of peo-
ple will contend that such rules ex-
ceed the FTC's statutory power. And
the proposed rules do seem to stretch
the pertinent law, which bans unfair
competitive practices. After all, to
brand cigarets as a cause of death is
not exactly promoting fair competi-
tion; the intent and hope is to maim
and if possible destroy an indtrstry.
Here plainly is an issue which
transcends that of smoking. The pas-
sion for control! is a built-in vice of
Government regulators, and that is
notably true of the FTC, with its in-
numerable pesky regulations and pro-
ceedings. Agencies should not be en-
couraged in their appetite for power,
-
especially power of doubtful legality.
Not surprisingly, this attitude re-•
veals a corollary trait'of regulators:
The tendency to regard the ordinary
citizen as a boob.
In the present case, the dispute
over smoking has been swirling
through the nation for at least a
decade, accompanied by untold mil-
lions of well publicized words setting
forth the arguments pro and con.
There is still some dispute about spe-
cific diseases to which smoking may
be related, but no one at all is arguing
that smoking is good for your physical
health.
If people in general aren't aware of
all this by now, then they must' indeed
be semi-morons,, just' as some officious
officials like to think. For our part,
we don't take that arrogant view.
People know very welli what they are
doing; some have chosen to give up
cigarets or not to start and others have
chosen to risk whatever hazards there
may be.
Common sense, it seems to us, sug-
gests that the industry and its adver-
tising men avoid any health claims or
appeals to youngsters, and to a con-
siderable e-,:tent they are avoiding
such implications. Should they or any
other industry make false claims or
engage in unfair competition, the au-
thorities can prosecute on that basis.
Beyond that, smoking should be left
up to the individual. It is no area for
Federal intrusion behind the smoke
screen of protecting us from ourselves.

CHICAGO DAILY NEWS
Qiicago, I11.inois
March 17, 1964
The FTC a n~ the (igret Issue
T-HE FEDFR:iL Tradr, Ce m.mission is
buckling down to the problem of what
health hazard warnings, if any, to require
agaret makers to put on their packages
and what they may and may not say in
their advertisements, C9tairman Paul R.
Dixon says the FTC will consider the
economics of the industiy in reaching its
decision. We hope it will also consider
thoughtfully the propriety of any such in-
trusion ': :to labeling and advertising.
The ;oonomic issue, while highly im-
portant, is not paramount. It is no trivial
znatter for a government agency to place
;tself athwart the lifeline of an industry
that pays federal and state governments
almost $3 billion a year in taxes, and sup-
ports in whole or in part some 17,000.-
" pcople.
I+ret•ertheless, if tobacco were a proved
drug o: the order of cocaine, or a proved
poison, the government would have a clear
duty in spite of the economic aspects.
But the degree of the health hazard
created by cigarets is still under vigorous
debate. Most smokers escape without seri-
ous damage; most who want to "kick" the
habit, can and do; research continues into
means of decontaminating cigaret fumes,
which beneficent result presumably would
intore the industry to its former place in
public regard. For the FTC in these cir-
cumstances to rush in with measures likely
to plunge the industry into chaos would
be unfair on the face of it.
Such a measure, we fear, is contemplated
in the proposal to require that every cig-
aret pack and every cigaret advertisement
carry a warning that cioaret smoking is
a potentially deadly hazard to health. It
would be a rankly discriminatory require-
ment, since almost any product consumed
by man is potentially deadly. We have
pointed out before that eggs contain po-
tentially deadly cholesterol; wine contains
potentiall.y deadly alcohol; fish contain
bones that might choke a person to death.
Yet it would be silly to require that any
of these be labeled as possibly deadly.
We certainly do not oppose the dov-
ernmcnt's stating the truth as the truth
unfolds. It has been doing this, and the
tobacco industry' has been hurting in con-
sequence.
We do not criticiie the FTC for its
efforts to make cigaret manufacturers stick
to the truth in their advertising, and espe-
cially to make no false or misleading claims
regarding cigarets and health. Such pre-
cautions are in the public interest.
But if the FTC were to cross over the
line and start telling cigaret manufacturers
what to say in their packages and ads,
that would put in the agency's hands a
coercave club that would threaten not only
the tobacco industry and, by extension, all
other manufacturers, but the freedom of
the press, itself. We hope the public, fol-
lowing the proceedings, will real.ize all that
is involWcd.

By George Dusheck
A Llnee-year study of 6,800 babies
born at Kaiser Foundation Hospital ap-
pears to have exploded the charge that
babies of cigaret-smoking mothers are
more apt to die at birth or soon after
berause they are smaller.
It is true they are smaller, Dr. Jacob
Yerushalmy„ University of California
biostatisticianj has fcund.
But they survive very mucfi oftener
than smaii babies of non~smoking moth-
ets, he reports in the Journall of Ob-
stetrics and Gynecology.
Dr. Yerushalmy does not argue that
smoking protects small babies against
the hazards of prematurity.
IT IS MORE LIKELY, he thinks,
that women who smoke are simply dif-
ferent from women who don't in per-
sonality. physiology, inheritance. One
way this difference is expressed is in a
tendency to have smaller yet well-.
developed, healthy- babies.
"Low birth weight," he notes, is ar-
bitrarily set at "less than 5 pounds,
8 ounces" (2,500 grams) by interna-
tional convention.
The 6,8W Kaiser babies studied dem-
onsrrat..~d what other observers have
found-that smoking women have more
babies under 5 pounds, 8 ounces.
Among 3,189 babies of non-smoking
white women, thei•e were 112, or 3.5 per-
cent, upderweight. Among 2,145 babies
of whife women who smoked, there were
12S b6bies, or 6.4 percent, underweight.
AMONG 934 NEGRO mothers who
didn't smoke, 46, or 4.9 percent, had
babies.weighing less than 5 pounds, 8
ounces. Among 479 smoking Negro
mothers, there were 64 undersveighl
babies, or 13.4 percent.
Thus, one intrzrestins differe-:,-e
emerged at once: Negro women tend to
have smaller babies than white women,
whether they smoke or not.
In genEral, it is true that small ba-
bies are more apt to be born dead or to
dic within a month after birth.
One study of 800,000 birtns a decade
ago showed neonatal mortality among
:)alb:es 5 puunds, 8 ounces or more was
7.8 per thousand. Among babies weigh-
inn less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces it was
173.7 per 1,000 births.
THE EXCESS of small babies among
smoking women at Kaiser Foundation
Hospital'iought therefore to be accompa-
nied by a higher neonatal death rate.
Instead, when Dr. Yerushalmy found:
White Women
Death Rats
Number Neonatal per i,d60 ~
of Babies Deaths Small Babies
Smokers . . . . . . . 137 19 137.7
Non-smokers .. 112 26 232.1
Negro Women
Smokers . . . . . . .. 64 7 109.4
Non-smokers . . . 46 12 260.9
Thus, deaths among underweight ba-
bies of white' non-smokers are 40 per-
cent higher than among smokers:' And
for Negro women the difference is even
more striking: Deaths among small ba-
bies of non-smokers is 140 percent
higher than among smokers.
He realizes his unexpected findings
wiltbe critically examined by those con-
vinced smoking causes lung eancer,
heart disease, and other mortal ailments.
TO TEASE THEM, he reminds sci-
en, ; writers of an earlier finding from
the same Kaiser Foundation Hospitals
study of mothera and babies:
Last year he found that not only do
aaLies tend to be smaller when the
mother smokes, they also tend to he
smillcr whc:: the mother does not
smoke, BUT THE FATIIER DOES.
"tf smoking-causes small babies, ex-
plain that," he su~gests.

Smoking Report
Ignored PolIufed A ir
By CHARLEB SCHAEFFEIt
progress Report Writer
WASR]1Vt7W.-1f the government abruptly banned cigarette
aa{ee, many clty dwellers would stdll get lung diseases like those
eOused by satoking.
Some ranlthtg Federal air pollution experts are saying the
aiebtabed govermnait smoking report could have gone a lot
fa:ther la atraestng this.
They agree with the United States Sitrqeon General's panel
dtat aatokfag te a life-shorteuing health nrt.ard and a cause of
ltvsg cancu. But they are unhappy about the committee's
bfllins d air wllutiam, which contains some Ingrediente strik-
ingiy adndlar so those in a bairning cigarette. Many scientlfie '
atudM. have Lopi3cated air polhttion la lung cancer and bron.
chltti{, too.
Remedial'Action
The 61ue.rSbimn panel's 367-page repo,tt, whose call for
"rensedtal action" against smoking f's now ofiicially Indorsed
by ibe Public }{ealtls Service, brushed over air pollution. 1t
.etapped np the whole problem In one sentence:
«ger t5s bulk of the popalatbn of the United States, the
-rrlatl.e impertanee of cigarette smoking as a cause ot chronic
braaebolsalmoaarp dtseare Is much greater than atmospheric
peMtfoa or occupational exposures."
Atr pollution experts argue that existing data Is Insufficient,
to make such a comparison. They are nettled, they say, becau:eR
the committee did not look deeply enough at the menace ot ,
dirty air to draw such a sweeping conclusivn,.
One Federal air-pollution authurity sa:d the smoking report,
va1id as it is about cigarettes, "can hardly be considered to be
dte Isst word out the effects of air pollution oh health or, for
lhex mattes, on the relative i'o•rporianoe of air pollution as com-
pued to cigarette smokinr and occapational exposure."
Smoking Studies
Original'ly, the panel was formed to evaluate the effect on
health of smoking and alrpo Ilution. Somewhere In process, the
we9ght'of 8000 separate smoking studies overwhelmed the 10-man
panel: The committee report conceded it wau "lmpracticablo"
to dM with all the aspects of the use of tobacco and the result.
fng effects, with all relevant aspects of air pollution, and all
pertinent characteristics of the external and internal environ-
ments and make-up of human beings."
-rhe air pollution authorities conceded they have a parochial
Interest In the subject. But they i'ndst objective study of the
smoking report supports their complaint that the comtnittee ~
did not give the dirty air devil hle due.
Thua, tttey assert If everyone suddenly etopped smoking,
city dwellers would still breathe many of the oascer suepecta (car•
olnogens) occurring in cigarette smoke and others besides. Some
of these compounds slow the tutir-like (clllary) action of the
lungs and Impede normal breathing In other waye..
Indeed, the late Dr. Louis D. Zeldberg of the Vanderbilt
School of Medicine reported Just last November that Nashville
citizens may breathe In tfte equivalent of two packe of cigarettes
a day of the cancer-producing chemical, bensepyrene, from burn•
!ng coal. Air polludon experts have detected equal amounts
in Birmingham and other coal-burning induetrlat citfee. Dr.
Zoldberg's 12-year United States-financed study found higher
death rates from all respiratory Ills among those living In hig5•
pollution areas.
Higher Dose
Air pollution experts believe that round-the-clock exposure
to .polluted adr may give a person a higher sustained dose of
aome of chemical itTitants than on-and-off daily smoking.
The smoking committee said more of two '1r pollution
elements, oxidea of nitrogen and carbon monoxide, for example.
enter amokers' lungs via cigarettes than In bad ;lr. Gavero-
ment air pollution experts simply say this Is pot trye.
Air pollution experts say scientists have found It eaater to
measure the hazards of cigarette smoke than the complexities of
fast-evolving chemicals beiched int.o modern city, aair. Thus,
there's ample data on smoking and too little on polluted air.

health director who now heads
the American Medical, Associ'-
ation's Department of En•

Foundation lectureship at the

7'6e AMA's much - hcrald-
ed study of cigarette smnk-
!eg will fall under his de-
partinent's jurisdiction.
But Bethel did talk about
the dangers of the four kinds
of chemicals and especially
air poilution.
"The doalhs rntes f r o m
cardio - respiratm•y diseases
are higher in urban than in
rural areas and increase with
the size of the city.
"The death rate from lung
cancer varies from the lowcstt
in rural areas to the highest
in the central portion of metro-
politan areas.
"There's mountains of evi-
dence for all this."'
But he said there wasn't
much hope without positive
action. "Pollutants are driven
before the wandering wind or
they are stagnated by the lack
of wind and they can!t be
escaped without' going to other
planets.
"It's one thing to blacken a
building, but another to p u t
that burden on people. A i r
pollution is present wherever
man is living:"
He urged that careful re-
search in air pollution be con-
ducted, and that cities, states
and even~ regions work tA-
gether on reaching a solution
to the problem.
On; the dangers of chemicals
in general, he said. "Whole
careers willi be built on finding
the safe uses of new products
and om finding previously un-
suspected hazards in o 1 d
friends.
"Survival In a steadily In-
creasing technology will be
dependent on still greater In-
creases In technology."
On pesticides: "I submit' we
need them. But we now manu-
facture themy by the train-
load. Along with intended vic-
tims, there are many unin-
tended casualties.
"No one can contend there
is nothing In fear from pesti-
cides, but at' least we still
'have time to look into t h e
problrmd and formulate effec-
tive programs."
On water pollution: "For-
tunptely, man can clean up al-
most any moss he makes. It
has now reached the stage of
clean up or else."

THE HEART OF THE MATTER: The smoker who abandons cigarettes to avoid heart dls.

CIGARETTES AND HEART DISEASE
Don't Jump From Weed
Into Cholesterol Fire
By TOM NOLAN
WASHINGTON (NEA)-Don't
get carried away with the idea
that quitting smokingwill auto-
matically lessen the odds of
your suffering a heart attack.
Despite the recent "guessti-
mate" by Dr. Ralph E. Knutti,
director of the National Heart'
Institute (NHI); that some
90,000 American cigarette smok-
ers may die this year of heart
attacks associated with their
habit, several other factors be-
sides smoking contribute to
heart disease.
Chief among these is your
diet. In a new pub'lication,
"The Food You Eat and Heart'
Disease," the U.S. P u b 1 i c
Health Service warns that add-
fag weight, overeating and eat-
ing when rushed can be just as
bad for your heart as smoking.
The PHS pamphlet lists these
general diet tips:
-Guard against being over-
weight: Each pound of excess
weight increases the burden on
your heart.
-Don't eat too much at one sufficient blood supply, the di-
time: When the stomach is sud- gestive organs cannnot perform

men aged'25 or over might be

ing „
But PHS notes that the main
factor causing coronary artery
disease remains due to a fatty
substance deposited inside the
walls of blood vessels, eventual-
ly clogging them so blood can't
flow. When the blood supply is
blocked, a heart attck results.
Chief ingredient of this fatty
deposit is cholesterol, normally
present in everyone's blood.

HEART DEATHS OFF
AMONG MEN 45-64
Trend Is Seen Reversed as
Rate Falls 6% in Decade
Zy JOHN' A. OSMUNDSEN
'1'he first downward turn in
ir death rate from heart and
blood vessel disorders among
middle-aged men has occurred,
according to the American
Heart Association in its annual
report, out today.
No explanation for the de-
cline was offered.
"Me significance of this de-
velopment is greater than the
heartening fact alone," Dr.
John J. Sampson, president of
the association; wrote in a fore-
word to the report.
"For many years," he con-
tinued, "the death rate from
cardiovascular disease among
men aged 45-64 had been
creeping upward in the United
States, in discouraging contrast
with the steadily declining rate
amorg women of the same age
-and indeed, among ali other
age groupings under 65. This
trend appears now to have been
reversed.°'
The drop in cardiovascular
death rate for that group was
6 per cent for the decade, 1950
to 1960.
Elsewhere in the report, au-
thorities in several fields that'have to do with cardiovascular
problems wrote what they
thought the next decade would
bring.
Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, pro-
fessor of surgery at~Baylor Uni-
versity In Houston, wrote that
the X-ray visualization of blood
vessels-called art'eriography-
would be so greatly improved
and simplified "that we will be
able to visualize the entire arte-
rial system with a preciseness
and clarity far beyond any-
thing we can now achieve."
This, he said, will permit' di-
agnosis of blood vessel disease,
enabling its correction before
complications and overt symp-
toms appear.
In regard to correcting vas-
cular disorders, Dr. DeBakey
perdicated that the materials
for blood vessel grafts would be
greatly improved and "eventu-
ally _will provide effective re-
placement for smaller vital ves-
•sels, such as those of the brain
and heart."
The surgeon also foresaw the
replacement of hearts either
with mechanical pumps or
hearts taken from animals or
deceased persons.
"More work is required to
perfect the intricate en in
eer
be far off through the use of
the computer and drugs tai-

the patient.
Dr. Lysle Peterson, professor
of physiology at the University

provide a greater understanding
of basic physiological proc-

S. C. Surgeons Swear Of f. Tobacco
They've Taken Own Advice
By PETER O. ALLAN
Staff Writer
The meeting looked quite
ordinary at first glance.
Just a group of men sitting
around -several long tables
at a Columbia hotel assem-
bly room listening to a
speaker.
There was one major
difference, however. De-
spite the prevalence of ash
trays only two of the 60
men were smoking.
The men were all doc-
tors in Columbia for the an-
nual meeting of the South
Carolina chapter of the Am-
erican College of Surgeons.
The air in the room was
clean because most of these
medical experts consider
smoking a "health hazard"
and believe there is a def-
inite link between smoking
and lung cancer.
"I have been advising my
patients for many years to
quit smoking," Dr. Ed-
mund Taylor of Columbia,
said "because of damage to
the lung, the association
with lung cancer and dam-
age to the circulatory sys-
tem."
Dr. Taylor said the re-
cently released U. S. Sur-
geon General's report on
smokin~ only ''re - enforc-
ed my ideas and made me
more definitive in, my ad-
vice." The Columbia sur-
geon added that he recent-
ly stopped smoking after a
gradual tapering - off per-
iod.
Dr. John Hawk, associ-
ate professor of surgery and
director of the cancer clin-
ic at the state's M e d i c a l
College at Charleston, has
"believed for some time"
that the "association • be-
tween smoking and a variet-
ty of diseases, including
cancer, is sufficiently con-
clusive." A non - smoker
himself, Dr. Hawk feels
the "medical profession has
an obligation to warn young
people not to start (smok-
ing)."
A Columbia thoracic sur-
geon, Dr. J. W. F o u c h a
feels there is a "definite
statistical relationship (be-
tween cancer and smoking)
but no actual proof It causes
it." He said, however, there
is "no question smoking is
a health hazard in many
. ways" and advises all his
patients who have chronic
lung conditions to stop.
"I quit over eight years
ago myself," Dr. Fouche
said, "because I smoked ex-
cessively and felt it was a
health hazard."
Dr. V. W. Brabham, a
private surgeon and direc-
tor of Orangeburg's cancer
clinic and hospital, also
advises his patients to stop
smoking "not only because
of cancer but because of
other diseases also."
During one of the meet-
ing's panel discussion Dr.
Harold S. Pettit recommend-
ed that "heavy smokers get
a chest X-ray every six
months." The doctor is a
professor of radiology at the
Medical College in Charles-
ton.
The most obvious thing
during the meeting was that
These- surgeons practice
what they preach. Many not
only tell their patients to
quit but have stopped them-
selves.
One doctor said the'Am-
erican Medical Association
recently estimated that over
50 per cent of the doctors
who smoked have quit in
' the last ten years.
Judging by South Caro-
lina's surgeons the figure
may be higher.

Some Doctors Doubt SmokeCancer -Link
By BOB SUDYK, Medical Writer
Thets still is no complete agreement among physi-
clans, pathologists and other medical experts that cigaret
smoking causes lung cancer.
It is likely that a national poll of medical men would
show that many more believe the results of the surgeon
general's report than disbelieve.
But it is also likely that unless and until researchers
are able to induce cancer clinically by the inhalation of
cigaret smoke the debate among physicians µ~ill con-
tinue.
This writer has interviewed a number of dissenters
and presents their views in this article. Tomorrow the
opposing opinion of a leading Cleveland chest surgeon
scill be presented.
The dissenters include Dr. ,lfilton Rosenblatt, chief of
medical clinics at New York's Metropolitan Hospital; Dr.
Charles W. Dla3o, son of one of the co-founders of the
Mayo Clinic: Dr. Ilarry S. Gre:ne. chairman of thc
pathology department at Yale University, and Dr. R. H.
R:gdon. professor of pathology at University of Texas
Medical School.
They believe that the surgeon general's 387-page re-
port released_ a month ago offers no proof that smoking
causes lung cancer. All have been involved in cancer
research.
Critics attack the report on these grounds:
THE COMMITTEE did not undertake any original
research but merely ecaluated research conducted by
others.... Major evidence is not statistically compatible
since it is based on seven separate statistical surveys by
a iariety of agencies.
sizisisooi
r
First of Two Articles
NONE of the population samples used was at all
representative of the U. S. male population. They were
isolated incidents. ... The mortality rate used is below
the national average, not only for smokers but for non-
smokers.
SOME of the report-s statistical oddities: Men smoking
le:s than 15 years have a slightly lotver mortality rate
than non-smokers. .. Ex-pipe smokers showed higher
death rates than both non-smokers and current smokers
in four studies. This means-that statistically it is safe to
smoke a pipe but dangerous to stop.
MOST I1IPORTAVT, they correctly charge that the
conclusiuns have never been backed up by laboratory
proof. That means that lung cancer has never been
induced in anv experimental anitnals by the inhalation
of ti;arct smoke alone. Why not, t::ey ask:'
Dr. Rosenblatt, a specialist ut cancer research fo: Sn
year5 said: `-The unscientific Ncay in which ttte,tudy eas
madc bother.; us most. The committee agreed first that
smoking causes lung cancer and then they se1 out to
prove it statistically."
He said that all clinical diagnostic methods currently
utilized for lung cancer vcere discovered or fully dc-
veloped only in the last 30 years-lhe period said to
have seen a great rise in smoking and lung cancer. Ile
believes it is unrealistic to ignore impro.-cd diagnusis as
a rcason 'or the rising incid( uce.
Critics attack U:e allc,^,rd relationship bctttcet, in-
creased use of tobacco andthe incrcas2in lung r7mcr_
Dr. Rosenblatt said the compnitter ic.nr.red the f:rt la.-l
lung caner was preralent in the 1901 (':mtun.
Hundreds of medical papers concerned ubout the in-
crease In lung cancer were printed as early as 1843 and
then the only diagnosis possfble was by autnpsy. This
was long before the popular use of tobacco, lie said.
Dissenters charge that the committee ignored the fact
that the rate of ihcrease in lung cancer is actua!ly de-
clining: '~1f+1;-20, rate of increase was 150%. 1930-35
rate was 78' e and 1955-60 rate was 33!'s .. and this
decline in the increase occurred when cigaret consump-
tion was rising by the billions," said Dr. Rosenblatt.
He also stated that the report erroneously said that
lung cancer occurred more in men than aonten because
men smoke more.lieshoe:edthat allstatistics oflung
cancer prior to 1900 indicated that it was ahcays a man's
disease.

For 8e#!er Healfl!
Research Continues
On Cigaret Elements
r And Harmful Effects
* By R'a16a C Alvarez,111.D.
F•saeritaa Paotcmoe of Medicine. May., Foundation
In the mtaesting little maga:me. "Physiology for Physicians,"
Dr. julittt H. Comroe Jr., of the Unnersih• of California shows how
co®pdiated the problem is of finding the harmfui chemicals in tobacco
a~he J~eads 261 chemicals have been identified in the smoke,
and laong tlaent are 16 "carcinogerri' (substances which can produce
eancer) not necessarly in man. 77heae are also 14 alkaloids„ or strong
cTsearira3s, of which nicotine is the most important.
I am interested to see that Dr. Comroe comes to the same
eowcinsion that I arrived at, which is that if' all "particulate" material
e removed by a filter, there will be no smoke, only an invisible gas.
Doubtless smokers would find no pleasure in this.
Dr_ Comroe goes on to sap that any smoke going into the bronchl
~hcs Oat orrv air into and out of the lunesl',can quickly cause spasm
narmwin$ of these tubes. Also, smoke tends qp~ckh•. to slow down
saaiag motion of the cilia, millions of tim hairs which, as they
~rar~ earsy,murns and other materials out of the lungs.
Some believe that nicotine has most to do with producing the
effert of smailing throughout thebodv, but we are not'sure of this,
Houesir, as DL Comroe sas•s, the important effects produced on the
bodv by absorbed ch'emials in tobacco smoke are probably those of
aicotint. -
Unfortunatr]c, we ph'ysicians dn not know enou,4li about the action
of nicotine in snnll idoses. We suspect that its main effect is on the
rtasora systna, but it can act on glands of internal secretion. As all
satolsss know, the first' cigar smoked by a bov an make him very ill.
Later, as the smoker becomes accustomed to tobacco, he can smoke
cgsa all day without feeling any distress.
7bae is some evidence that nicotine can cause the spasm in the
b]ood eessels which is observed so commonlv after the smoking of a
oiptette. The otdinarv cigarette contyins about 20 mgs. of nicotine.
Bmme Of the spasm in the blood vessels due to nicotine, when one
sarokes a cigarette the temperature of the skin of the toes may drop in
different people by as much as 4.3 dcgrees centigrade, and in the
fegets, by perhaps 7.7 degrees centigrade.
Same of the "denicotinized" cigarettes contain 10 mgs. instead
of 20 mgs. Some cigarettes are made of a special Kentucky burleigh
bbacm which oonlains only 1/1Sth as muoti rricotine as other tobocoos
eoslain.
page 29
Dr. Comroe is not yet sure whether smoking helps to harden the
arteries.
Phyaical Reactions
Many people, as they smoke, increase their pulse rate by from
15 to 20 beats a minute. There is no definite effect on the movements
of the stomach. Some physieians are sure smoking is bad for a man
with an ular. Many smokers lose weight when they smoke, and
rapidly gain weight when they quif
Smoking often relieves nervous tension; it reduces anxiety, and it
gives pleasure. Unfortunatttlv, we don't know jjut how these effecti
are brought about. We don't know exactlv what smoking does to the
addictedpeople that means so much to them that in some cases they
would ratfrer die than quit. Some heavy smokers suspeathat they get
much of their oomfort just from having something always in the hand.
Dr. Raymond Pearl pointed. out in 1938 thatsmoking often
shortens a person's life, but he did not know just how it does this.
What I have notedi is that a havy smoker with a bad bronchitis, if he
gets pneumonia, often dies in two or three days. It' is difficult to
produce with tobacco smoke the same effects in animals as in man,
andithis u why most of our studies on the ba&amp;effects of' smoking have
to be carried out on men and women.
There is considerable evidence that smoking is one cause of
emph'ysema, a serious disease of the lungs which usually shows up at
about the agrof 50. However, the fact that I 1 per cent of the patients
with this disease have never smoked shows that there are other
pusative factors.

W zen el's research also found
a direct relationship between
nicotine and the rise of blood
ehoiesteroi as rabbits.
`I donit believe that smok-
.k
iag as such is the one cause
or necessarily the major
cause of heart disease," he
added quickly,
°Pm not even thoroughly
convineed'that smoking alone
would produce this damage
without other influences. But
we can't always avoid these
other influences. We can
avoid smoking."
Dr. Wenzel's research for-
merly was sponsored by the
Tobacco Industry Research
Committee. Since then he has
had grants from the Life In-
sarance Medical Research
PSmdo KU and the United
8tates Public Health Service,
with the latter two groups still
supporting his work.
Besides nicotine, Wenzel
lists three key factors related
to heart idsease:
1. Diet. ("Here the prin-
cipal culprit seems to be sat-
urated fats.") i
2. Nervous state of the in-
dividuali ("The damage of-
ten is not~ seen until it has
occurred.")
3. Lack of physical exer-
cise.
Wenzel, who calls hiinself
an '•interested but frustrated'
worker," said the complex in-
terrelationship of these an&amp;
lesser factors is one reasorr
the federal report was not
conclusive about nicotine's re-
lationship to heart disease.
"Mis is not so with smok-
ing and lung can¢eq since
the relationship is more sim-
pie,° he said: ,
Wenzeli said not only is it
difficult to demonstrate the
damaging effect of nicotine
on the cardiovasular system,
but: the methodology itselfi is
a problem.
A central difficulty is that
heart research with nicotine
is conducted on animals, usu-
ally rat§, who are not under«
going other heart-damaging
influences.
Wenzel, in his research lab-
oratory , at the University of
Kansas, has overcome this ob-
ataele by simulating condi-
tions of induced heart dam-
age in the experimental ani-
mals. Such conditions are
considered analogous to those
of many persons whose heartt
are damaged (probably un-
knowingly) by improper diet,
nervous stress or lack of prop-
er exercise.
Another problem is that
rats refuse to "smoke." They
cannot' be put in experimen-
tal smoke chambers, Wenzel
said, since theireither hold
their breath or become as-
phyxiated.
This problem is met by gic-
tng the animals with induced
heart damage, nicotine in
their drinking water. Rats
drink at intervals similar to
those of a person smoking
cigarettes, Wenzel explained.
And like people, rat's get the
"tobacco habit."
The amount of nicotine giv-
en rats is that needed for a
"psychie response"similar to
the response in a man who
smokes one pack a day. "Psy-
chic response" is something
like the psychological satis-
faction a habitual smoker, has
when his immediate need
for nicotine has been met.
For the average experimen-
tal rat, which weighs about
one-half pound, the daily'dose
of nicotine is about one-240th
the weight of a grain of
wheati
"When given this, we can
prove demonsttable effects on
the animal with this border-
line, induced cardiac condi-
tiona'," Wenzel said.
The KU pharmacologiat has
used several methodlr for
measuring damage to .the
cardiovascular system in rats,
but the one thaCappears most
uaeful is to measure changes
in various enzyme levels in
the heart.
Wenzel's research has dem-
onstrated that nicotine dam-
ages the heart through the
same fundamental mechan-
ism that lack of exercise
and the emotions act upon the
heart: Very simply (but not~
entirely accurate technically)',
it Is the release of adrenalin-
a mechanism Wenzel suspects
is in operation more than
commonly realized.
"if we had glass windows
In our chests through which
we could see damage to our
hearts when it' occurs, we
would be scared to death,"
Wenzel, said.
His advice, besides not
smoking;, is to exercise, pro-
vide a serene emotional' en-
vironment and eat proper
food.
Such measures fall into the
area of "intuitive health," an
area thathas been understood
for some time by Europeans
and Russians.
Evidence of new concern Is
an International Conference
on Preventive Cardiology in
August: at the University of
Vermont. Dr. Wenzel will
give a major paper at that
conference on the role of nico-
tine incardiovascul8r disegse.

Cigarette Risk, Seen Less,
But `Safer Still Isn't Safe'
By )oaeph R Hizson
of The Ea+r: r.•16s.. SraJ
CHICAGO.
The cancer hazards of to-
bacco smoke have been
sharply reduced by cigarette
nlters and tobacco processing
improvements. but there is
stiL! plenty of cancer risk left
to take out.
So says a sdentist-who was
one of the first researchers to
warn of the link between
cigarette smoking and lung
cancer. In a paper read be-
fore the American Association
for Cancer Research here. Dr.
Ernest L. Wynder of New
York's Sloan-Kettering Insti-
tute for Cancer Research,
said his studies with animals
and hamans are eon#irmitg
the vaine of cellulose and
charcoal filters. He said other
studies show filter smokers
don't light up any more
often than they did whcn
they suwked regular cigar-
ettes-
In their report. Dr. Wyndcr
and Dr. DLedrich Ha$man&lt;&lt;
said that today smokers are
exposed, on the average, to
approximately 50 per cent
less tar and nicotine than
was the smoker of unfiltered
_dgarettes ten years ago.
CHARCOAL SCREEN
Talking to reporters about
the study, supported by the
American Cancer Society. Dr.
Wynder told them to stress
that cigarettes aren't -saie,"
that they still provide the
buman lung with at least a
dozen proven cancer-in-
ducers, and that there is
plenty of room for improve-
ment.
Por one thinc. he said, a
wet filter does a better job
than a dry one. Water. he
said, is still the best filter
for removing the tobacco
tars.
How was one to smoke
through a wet filt'er7 Dr.
\'Vyndcr shruaged, "I don't
make cigarettes," he said,
"I only perform research."
The research at Sloan-
Kett'ering, the scientist said,
confirmed an earlier report
from the Arthur D. Little
firm in Boston that charcoal
In filters does screen out
chemicals In smoke that re-
duce the waving motion of
tiny hairs (cilia) in the small,
bronchial tubes. The waving
-of the myriad tiny hairs helps
clean particles out of the
lungs. Some scientists theo-
rize that the loss of this pro-
tective action in smokers'
lungs exposes them to a
greater cancer risk. Dr. Wyn-
der said his tests show that
compressed charcoal in filters
would do the job even better
than charcoal granules.
He said that the more com-
pleteiy that the tobacco in a
cigarette burns, the fewer are
the carcinogens (cancer in-
ducers) that reach the lungs.
He attributed the Increased
aafety in cigarettes also to
the way tobacco processors
are cutting and curing the
leaf. But he said there is
room for improvement here,
too:
Dr. Wynder said the incor-
poration of traces of copper
nr other minerals in the to-
bacco cuts down the carcino-
aens In the smoke. But he
said the resulting compounds
formed when the cigarette
burns have a terrible smell
and make the addition of
trace metal impractical for
the time being.
In his test of smoke con-
tents, the Sloan-Kettering
researcher uses rats, mice
and even clams (for the
cilia - waving experiments).
But he said he also has a
long-term study running to
And out whether smokers
can tell which cigarette they
should smoke and whether
there is added risk for them
if they cough when they
smoke. Cough, said Dr.
Wynder, seems to be a pretty
good~ test! for the effect of
smoke tars on the smoker.
As for the labeling of cig-
arettes with their tar and
nicotine content. Dr. Wynder
said he approved of it be-
cause it tends to make the
smoker more conscious of
cigarette safety. He said the
tobacco companies will con-
tinue to respond to consumer
demands for safer cigarettes.
Since Dr. Hoffmann had
also presented a paper on
air pollution and lung cancer,
Dr. Wynder was asked about
it. He said he and his col-
league had found that though
there are cancer inducers in
gasoline exhaust, many of
them are so volatile that
they rise straight up in the
air. He said even dwellers in
cities with maJor air pollu-
tion problems don't receive
it dose of carcinogens In
breathing that is anywhere
near as concentrated as that
which the smoker inhales.
Besides he said, most people
breathe through their noses.
That gives the body's own
211tratiot; apparatus a chance
to screen out particles. The
smoker, on the other hand,
bypasses this protection by
inhaling through his mouth.
Dr. Wynder looked around
the room and saw some re-
porters still smoking ciga-
rettes. albeit filter tipped. He
told them to stop. Safer
isn't sa!e. he said.

POLLUTION OF AIR '
LINKED TO CANCER ~
West Gennan Study Find:
Smoking Is Not a Cause
: By AB,THUR J. OL.cEYY
fterid ts 2he Ne. York TfinesROATN, March 7-• A broadly
4 based analysis of lung cancer
aases In the West German stxtr
` ' : of North-Rhine Westphalia has
produced' nn stati.ctic•ai eviiiencn
that cigarette smoking cau: ,:;
the disease.
C ~y The report: published this
week in the Journa' of Cancer
ltesearch In Dilsseidorf. con-
`
of Bronchial Carcinoma In
North-Rhine We.clihAl l a."
A report by the Surgeon Gen-
eral of the United States Public
Health Service said secently
that cigarette smoking was a
cause of lnnfi c:rnr•nr.
Dr.Poche and two colicag!res
based their Analy;sis, on infor-
mation contributnl by 12 in-
stitutes in the West German
Industrial state, which includes
the Ruhr manafacturing area.
A total of 1,229 cases of lung
cancer was studied and autop-
uy reports of 26,000 other cases
were brought into the analysis.
The report was written by
ProL Reinhardt Poche, chief
physfcian of the Pathological
,Jnstituta of : the Diisseldorf
'~_~Cadeny of Meajicine. It is en-
' tltled "Statistical Ilivestigations
cludes that air pollution by
gasoline vehicles and industriali
gases f.s a more likcly cause of
lung cancer.
Vlctims' Age Cited
The researchers concluded
that "no statistically demon-
strable connection" could be
found between cigarette smok-
ing and tho occurrence of lung
cancer. They furthcr as:,erted
that "othcr external infhrences,"
particularly• air pollution, had
tn-be considprcd in the inereas-
in occurrence of lung cancer.
St'at'istical evidence in the
Llusseldorf study tending to
acquit cigarette smoking as a
cause of ^.ung cancer centered
on two observations.
The researchers discovered
that the average age of patients
whn cant_'tcted lung cancer was
M.1 ycars. Among younger
victimr;. tlie ycars, of greatest
inciri:•nce werre the late forties.
Tli^ rcacarrhers found that
la~ r••n,•clntinn between age and
Ir.:r;Z r•mcnr had remained un-
chanccri in :Vortlt-Rhine West-
piiaha cincP 140t1.
If ri;;arcite smoking wm•e a
cause of-canner, t.he average
age nf victims should havc
shifted noticeably tn earlier
pcars, the West German re-
. searchers said„
, 'l'l.ink io Ucc:upatinn
The 4econri ebservation de-
rived from a study of cancer
inc.idence in rela.tion to the oc-
cupations of the victims. The
researchers found that persons
who worked in offices or non-
industrial buildings weree leasti
likely to contract lung cancer:
A)though, as a group4 they were
the most intensive smokers. .
' Most susceptible to lung oa.n•
4L-r were inductrial workers and ,
!.ersons physically eng-aged in
rransp,ortatirnu such as triirk
anri taxi drivers. thc researchers;
;:a Id.
Pt•nfessor Poche rtid it was
hiy;hlv probable thza their ause
ccptrumty was retated to Uherr
frequent and intimate exposure
to carcinogenic industrial hy-
prod&gt;icts in the alr. As examples
he cited vehicle exhaust and the
microscopic particles hurled int n
the atmosphere by the wearing„
down of automobile tires.
The researchers also found'
that persons afflicted with
chronic respiratory discasea
,were more likely to get lun;:
cancer. They speculatcd tha'
nwcus produced in the respirn-
tnr;v trar.t, by these discase9
't'cnded t'o collect and r•on.cn-
krrte cancer-causiiig p,:r:ticlcs
in the lung tissues.
The detailed~ analysis of lun,
cancer cases by the West Get-
man researchers produced sta-
tisticai patterns that rrofrssor
Poche expressed as hypotheses:
lncreasex Ara Offset
The first• labeled the "bal-
ance hypothesis," states that
the incidence of cancer among
men and women in a large pop-
ulation group is the same or,
when it' varies sli; htly, stands
in a definite and permanent re-
lationship.
The t•eport said it had'been
found thats if cancer of a cer:
tain organ tended to rise amonq
women, It was offset by decline
of another fnrm of eN&gt;&gt;rrr nn hy

cause, they said.
The Magazine for Cancer P+:-
seac+ch published the study, m-de
"C, of 1229 lung cancer patient.ti in
12 iiastitutions In North Rl,ine-
Westphalia.
The repordt contradictr.d oon-
¢lnsions published in the I7 , ;:~d
States by saying that lun„ t.an•
cer did not come earlk." to
heavy smokers than to !•g'iG

The doctors said they fc-!;,d' no
eonnect:on between the ,^e
age of the lung canrer rer
and th-- numbcr of c: tn,y.
smok,A daily. The
! were feVr and~ accidcni: I. rti` said.
The report said -IC;r,t
smoking was respcr.sitle for .

and circulatory ailmcnts.
the frequerrcy of lung cancer and ci;arette
smokin;. It sai&amp; other external factors,
especially air pollution and motor exhaust
fumes, must be linked with the increase in
the prevalence of lung cancer.
Poche,, who took issue with the findings
last January of the U.S. surgeon general's
report linking cigarettes with cancer, said
at the time his group s studies soon would
be released and would bear out his con-
tention.
Poche and his associates said in Lheir
report their work indicated thaG office
employes and academicians who were
heavy smokers nevertheless showed a lesser
incidence of lung cancer.
They said' that the occupational grnups
most likely to fall victim to lunb cancer
were workers in heavy industry and in
Iransportation, people exposed to heavy
air pollution and exhaust fumes from diesel
and &gt;;asnline motors.
North~ Rhine \5'estphalia, where the stud-
ies were made, is Germany's most heavily
industrialized state. It contains the Ruhr
coal and steell center.
Poche's study said that increasing lung
cancer among outdoor and farm workers
could be traced to the spreading use of
diesel -powered ' machincry in farm and con-
struction wonk, according, to Die Welt.
The report also said that chronic colds
and respiratory virus diseases also may
play a part in causing luna cancer.
The report said urban air pollution un-
doubtedly accounted for increasing lun,;
cancer in North Rhine Westphalian cities
because irritating particles that can cause
cancer were swallowed into the systeni
along with mucuous secretions produced by
the body in reaction to dirty air.

An erninent writer-statistician says the Surgeon Gen-
eral's smoking report has more holes than an overworked
pincushion
He notes that the evidence on which the report was
based was primarily statistical, but' the panel of advisors
eomistcd of eight doctors, a chemist and only a single
Statis:ician.
1he broadside at the report comes from the typewriter
of Alan S. Donnahoe, assistant publisher of The Richmond
Times-l3ishatch and News Leader.
A prolific pipe and cigaret smoker, Donnahoe has lec-
tured statistics at University of Virginia, has served on
committees of the U. S. Census Bureau an&amp; the U. S.
• Only 15 to 20 per cent of surveyed smokers who
Labor Statistics Bureau, and is an advisor of The Ameri-
can Statistical Association.
Surgeon General Luther Terry„ he says, should hide
his head in shame because the paradoxical-plus report
shows statistically that:
• In three of the seven government studies, all the
smokin;, and non-smoking males surveyed had LOWER
mortaIity rates than other U. S. males-30 per cent lower
in one case. This is a matter of statistics from the same
fnaterial used for the government report-as are the fol;
lowinr examples:
• A°fen between S0 and 89 who smoke have 40 per cent'less mortality rate than non-smokers.
• Men who have puffed cigarets for less than 15 years
have a lower mortality rate than non-smokers.
allowed to pick samples from their own acquaintances,
he points out.
And-the committee, he says, admits 33 per cent of
those polled didn't answer-"thus raising the possibility
of serious bias in the results."
Donnahoe prints this quote from the report: t'None of
the study populations was designed, in particular, to be
representative of the male U. S. population."
Donnahoe's ire is raised by the failure of any scien-
tists taking p2rt in the report to experiment witK animals
by making them inhale smoke over long periods of time
to see if cancer developed.
"No adequate explanation~ is given of why more work
had not been Oone in this highly important research area,"
says the author.
Donnahoe urges the government to take two steps:
e Appoint a committee of distinguished statisticians
to review evidence on the subject.
+ Ask the committee to lay down the framework for
•all future studies, to ensure reliability of results.
"'It may be appropriate'to suggest that the final word
has not yet been written, by the Surgeon Generalis com-
mittee or otherwise, on the subjeCt of smoking and can-

is a major cause of death from almost every other disease.

• Even tho four European countries have lower cig-

• Low income citizens have twice the cancer rate, as
do those working in the alcohol beverage trade and those
citizens born in Poland and England. And that has noth-

Shall We
Smoke or Quit Smoking?
"The report raises more questions
than it answers."
That is the view of Alan S. Donna-
hoe on thereport of the surgeon
general's advisory committee on the
relationship of cigarette and other
smoking and the incidence of lung
cancer.
Donnahoe Is executive vice presi-
dent and assistant publisher of the
Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch and
News Leader.
In an article in the Times-Dispatch
he says the committee, composed of
eight doctors, one chemist and a
statistician, "did not undertake any
original research." Instead it reviewed
seven surveys by others "unrepresent-
ative of any known population of any
kind."
Donnahoe quotes the report as
saying:
"It is clear that the seven ...
studies involve populbtians which are
heolthier than the United States as
o whole. Secondly, the low death rate
for non-smokers suggests the possi-
bility that the studies recruited un-
usually healthy groups of non-
smokers."

The report shows that Holland,
Switzerland, F i n I a n d and Great
Britain have a lower per capita con-
sumption of cigaret'tes than the
United States, but all' have higher
mortality fromJung cancer. "Indeed,"
notes Donnahoe, "in the case of
Great Britain, the mortality rate is
more than double that of the United
States."
Another ponnahoeism: "Any sci-
entist who could offer experimental
proof of the casual effect of cigarette
smoking on any type of cancer would
doubtless win a brace of: Nobel prizes.
Why, then, so little effort in this par-
ticular experimental field? The ap-
parent answer: Scientists do not
believe they can establish any such
retoiionsf,iP, and hence are nnt wilGn,g
to waste their time in this type rt
effort."
On pipe smoking, the surgeon gen-
eral's committee says: "Death rates
for current pipe smokers were little
If at all higher than for non-smokers,
even with men smoking 10 or more
pipefuls per day and with all meri
who had smoked pipes for more than
30 years. Ex-pipe smokers, on the.
other hand, showed' higher death
rates than both non-smokers and
current smokers in four out of five°
studies. The epiderniological studie~
on ex-cigar and ex-pipe smokers ary
inadequate to explain this puzzling
phenomenon."
The conclusion to be drawn from-
the foregoing paragraph seems to be
that it is quite safe to smoke a pipe,
but highly dangerous to discontinuo
the practice.
Shall we smoke, or shall we not?'

	not made up of the right people, and suggesting that we
	have no reaI understanding of the problem.
	When a man says something, and is not free to say
	the opposite, then what he say is suspect. If the com-
	mittee had found that cigaret smoking is really a bene-
	fit to the health and that no connection with cancer
	can be found, and that athletes in training should smoke
	at least two packs a day, it would have been free to
	make that report. It was not hired to make a special
	pleading, but to find the facts as well as possible and
	to report themL
	Many physicians have smoked cigarets, and quite a
	number of them have quit, not because they didn't en-
	joy smoking, but because they were convinced that it
	Is downright dangerous. Some of them have turned

~	to pipes and cigars, which are not considered very
harmful, largely because smokers are not inclined to
	Inhale with them. Inhaling smoke of any kind is harm-
	ful, and it is possible that tobacco smoke is as' little
	harmful as any, but that does not mean it is not harm.-
	ful.
	Older people who have the habit may, or may not
	quit because of the report, or perhaps we should say
	facts„ and it may not make too much difference. But
	when the manufacturers go on advertising cigarets as
r~ ;	being about the most enjoyable thing in life, beautiful
	young women, in glowing health and beauty, and .find.
	appearing young men; making it the only proper thing
~ L	to do, they are doing a damaging thing to society.
	In other countries there is a tendency for the gov-
T~3j	ernments to take a hand not forbidding the use of
	ci'garets but by preventing the advertising of cigarets
~	on
television as a most desirable thing for every young
~	person to take up. It is a hard habit to break, and of
	course if young people can be persuaded that it is the
	thing to do and form the habit, they are likely to keep
	on with it.
	However, in this country there is a fear of the gov-
	ernment doing anything of the sort, a fear that the
	federal government is becoming too powerful, and that
	it interferes in private business too much, so the ad.
~	vertising. is likely to go on.

PAL'NT BEACH SIiORES,,
Flil., March 25 The link be-
tween ci-arets and huig can-
ccr hasn't changed the smok-

leading cancer researchers, a
survey here shows.
Of 12 scientists questioned
by this correspondent at a
meeting 'of cancer experts
and n e w s m e n here, five
smoke c ilg a r e t s and two
smoke pipes.
Not one of the smokers
said lie intends to give up
the habit. None of the norn
smnkens said they had given
itt up as a result of the link
between cigarels and~ cancer.
;ucither nf the pipe-smok-
ors had smnked cigarets be-
Inre the lung cancer tie-in
was shown.
hixny clf the smokers tended
in drntn{nlxy the dangers of

alrtme other reason firRt

you do. I enjoy smoking, so
I timoke."
A similar view was ex-
prcyscNl hy Dr. Carlos Mar-
physiologist at the Uni-
versitt.~ of 1blinnesota, who
said:
"1'hcrr.'v ri%k In %moking, ,

Another smoker, Dr. Robert
G. Ravdin, associate professor
of surgery at the University'
of Pennsylvania, put the re-
sponsibility squarely on his
own shoulders. said Ravdin:
"I believe the surfiwtn
general's report implicit,y,
but I don't have the courage
to stop."
Dr. Chester M. Southam, off
the Sloan-Kettering Institute
in New York, has been a pipe
smoker most of his life. He
commented:
"Even 1f I smoked ciga•
. rets I probably wouldn't
qnit tmless it were a guar•
anteed death warning."
Dr. Charles Huggins, of.
Chicago, developer of what
may he a lunfi cancer preven-
tive for smokers, praised
smoking.
"it quletc me and' helps
ntR cronl•entrale,:' he said.
Dr. Edgar Ribi, biologist
with the Rocky Mountain Lab
oratory in Hamilton, Mont.,
made a joke of his pipe
smoking.
"I haven't haA a cold since
I started at the age of 18,"
he said.
An anonymous doctor also
said he smokes because he
enjoys it.

Nor did It ltit• Dr. Alton

openly critieized the Ameri.
can Medical Association for
not taking a firm stand
against cigaret smoking.
Dr. Ruth Gutttnann, profes-

It's Doctor's Orders
* * *
Buf Cancer Men st;ii Smoke
By CHARLES SCHAEFFER
PALM BEACH SHORES.
Fla.-The nation's.top can-
cer researchers are ignoring
the doctor's orders.
The doctor, in this case,
is the U. S. surgeon general,
Dr. Luther Terry, who ad-
vised Americans to quit
smoking.
The cigaret snokers among
cancer scien-
tists polled
here at a na-
tional meet-
ing, however,
say they plan
t o continue.
So do the pipe
smokers.
At the same
time they
agree gener-
ally with Dr.
Schaeffer
Terry that smoking can
cause lung cancer.
• r *
ON THE other hand
many of the nation's scienc
writers say they ha•
stubbed out theair final bu
since Terry's smoking pan
delivered its verdict almo:
three months ago.
Some 50 writers met wq
about 30 cancer scientists k
discuss new research !'ind
ings. About 20 sciqntis+
smokers said they continue(
cigarets. The 15 quitters ir
the group, It turned out
were in the sr.ience writinF
ranks.
Of 12 scientists ques-
tioned extensively, f i v e
smoged cigarets and twc
smoked pipes. None of the
smokers said he intends tc
quit. The non-smokers dic
not give tip because of thc
cigaret-cancer link. Nor hac
the pipe smokers switched
from cigarets.
Cigaret-puffing Dr. Robert
G. Ravdin: associate profes.
cor of surgery at the Uni•
versity o f Pennsylvania•
saidc "I believe the surgeon
general's report implicitly,
but I don't have the courage
to stop."
• +~ •
DR. Charles Huggins,
University of Chicago School
of Medicine, startled the
conference by announcing
the possibility of an anti-
cancer pill for smokers. If
it comes, it will be after his
lifetime, he observed wry1y.
Meanwhiit, he continues his
12 cigarets a day; "It quiets
me and helps me concen-
trate," he said.
Said University of Miami
biochemist, Dr. Kenneth Sa-
vard: "The chance of get-
ting. lung cancer from ciga-
rets is so small I'll probably
die from smoke other reason
Tirst Teher's a risk In ev-
erything you do. I enjoy
smoking, so I smoke."
A physiologist at the Uni-
versity of MinNmsota, Dr.
Carlos Martinez, said:
"There's a risk in smoking,
but there's a risk in riding
a jet airplane, too. Besides,
smoking in itself won't give
you lung, cancer. If you're
going to get it,, smoking will
speed up the process by five
years or so."
Dr. Chester M. Southam
of Sloan-Kettering Institute
in New York, a veteran pipe
smoker, commented: "Even
if I smoked cigarets, I prob-
ably wouldn't quit unless it
were a guaranteed death
warning."
Of those polled the only
reasercher who had quit
smoking did so two decades
ago because of sinus head-
aches. He is Dr. George 0.
Cey of Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity.
Nobel Prize winner Albert
Szent-Gyorgyi of the Marine
Biology Laboratory, Woods
Hole, Mass., just never
started smoking. Neither
did Dr. Altom Ochsner of the
Ochsner Clinic, New Or-
leans, who twitted the
American Medical Associa-
tion for not publicly con-
deming cigaretsmoking.
One of the ex-smoking sci-
ence writers was the target
of a barb by Dr. `Perry at
a recent xieeting in Wash-
ington. "I can't understand
why this individual waited
till the report came out to
quit when he knew all along
what was in it," observed
the surgeon general.
Asked about this, the re-
porter said, "I iust needed
somethine official."

PAL:YI BEACH SHORF~S F'la..
111arch 25.-A leading health
statistician said Wednesday that
much of the lor,; accepted dif-
ference in death rates between
sexes may be attributable to
differences in cigaret smoking:
not fundamental sex differences:
Furthermore, said Dr. Morton
L. Levin, evidence now indi-
cates that cigarets can be
blamed for. "a minimum~' of
1001000 excess d e a t h s in
America every year.
Excess deaths can be defined
loosely as early deaths. In
smoking studies, they are calcu-
lated by comparing deaths
among smokers at each age
level with~ deaths expected from~
general life expectancy tables.
Dr. Levin., chief of epidemi-
ology at the Roswell Park
Memoriali Institute in Eutfalo,
N. Y., made his reinarks at, the
sixth annuai American Cancer
Society Science 1t%riters' Semi
par here.
He offered figures indicatinl
that nearly 45 percen6 of thc
higher male death rate can bc
attributed to smoking.
The reasoning runs like this:
In the 25-to-64-year ade group.
I55;700 more ~nen than H~o~nen
died in America in a gi~~en
typical year (1960).
In the same year. there were
69.800 excess deaths among male
smokers. These men presum-
ably wouldi not have died that
year had they not been heavy
smokers.
The excess deaths among
sntokers constituted 20 percent
of alldeaths for that age group
-a significant fact in itself.
But by comparing the 69,000 ex-
cess smokers' deaths with the
155.700 excess: death:; among all-
men, the statisticians came to
the conclusion that 44.8 percent
of these excess deaths among
malt;s could be. blamed on
smoking. Previously, t h e differences
(which are usually expressed
as a longer life expectancy for
women) had been attributed
loosely to biological and other
differences between men and
women.

that other factors are at work,"

a recent poll of many doctors
Indicates that 95 per cent think
smoking injurous and shows
that only 23 per cent of the
doctors continue to smoke.
Dr. Ocbsner pointed out that
ed, he believes the AMA is also
wrong in setting out to do a lot
``''' of new smoking research. He
said this seemed to be a "delay-
ing tactic."
The AMA recently accepted a
pledge of $10 million from a
group of cigarette companies
for this research.
Some other doctors, such as a
medical school dean who spoke
here, have found the AMA stand
merely "puzzling."
on his screening of many sab-i
stances In laboratory rats. lie'
found several dozen substances
that appear to block or cancel
out the effects of injections of
the mostpowerful'of the cancer-
inducing hydrocabrons. Traces
of these hydrocabons are com-
monly found in cigarette tars.
The phenomenon of blocking
cancer-causing actions has been
known for years. But Dr. Hug-
gins is zealous about Its possi-
bilities.
An example of a long-known
blocking action involves "butter
yellow", an artificial coloring
agent barred from use here butl
used in other countries. Alone,
it is a cancer-inducing product
so it Is barred in the United
States. But a common vitamin
blocks the cancer activity of
butter yellow, so many doubt if
its use elsewhere is actually
harmful.
Dr. Huggtns has carried re-
search into blocking agents
much further.
He seems to believe the pos-
sibilities may be enormous-a
pill; even, that would block the
cancer causing agents in smoke
and, possibly, other cancer-
causing agents, many still uni-
dentified, in the enviroment.
; Dr. Huggins was the re-
searcher who devised the cur-
pently-used treatment for pros-
trate cancer and has advanced
he treatment of breast cancer.
His work on cancer-blocking
substances has been with Dr.
Ryo Fukunishi, assistant pro-
fessor at the lab.
Transplant Tolerance
Some of the substances may be
r e a d y for clinical-meaning
h u m a n-investigation F.
Huggins nas implied. ^,' aat may
mean prisoners who volunteer.
In another report, Dr. Carlos
Martinez of the University of
Minnesota Medical School, said
a new' experimental technique
has opened up possibilities for
transplanting h u m a n, organs
with more assurance of success
than heretofore. _
Describing experiments with
mice, he said that up to now the
most common way of inducing
olerance of grafts or trans-
lants between mice was to
condi.tion the recipient in ad-
vance with the donor's cells.
Dr. Martinez said that In new
tests, the transplanted cells
were broken up and homogen-
ized before being injected into
recipient mice. He said there
were no adverse reactions like
those produced by intact cells.
He thus indicated that event-
ually it might be possible to
prepare a human for an organ
transplant by conditioning him
in advance with homogenized
cells typical of those of a par-
ticular organ.
made the statemcnt in addres-
sing the sixth atlnual 'semi'nar
for science writers sponsored by
the Ameriran Cancer Society.
He did so in commenting on~ a
letter sent to the Federal Trade
Commission recently by Dr.
F. J. L..Blasingame, executive
vice president of the AMA.
In the letter, Dr. Blasingame
said that Congress, not the FTC,
should decide on any limitations
on cigaret advertising, and that
warning labels-as advocated by
the FTC-would not do much
good because people already are
aware of the alleged hazards of
smoking.
"Doctors should take the
lead," said Dr. Ochsner. "This Is
it health problem."
• Referring to the fact that the
AMA has undertaken a long•
range research program on the
subJect of smoking, Dr. Och.
sner continued:
"Personally, I think the AMA
Is wrong. I think we have the
answers right now. Doing more
research is a delaying tactic.°
He added that the AMA
should make a public statement
asserting whether Dr. Blasing-
ame's letter represented ' the
position of the AMA as a whole
or only the doctor's view as an
individual.
But Ochsner Indicated that,
for the present, he took the
letter to represent the official
view •of the AMA.

ed, he believes the AMA is also
wrong in setting out to do a lot
``''' of new smoking research. He
said this seemed to be a "delay-
ing tactic."
The AMA recently accepted a
pledge of $10 million from a
group of cigarette companies
for this research.
Some other doctors, such as a
medical school dean who spoke
here, have found the AMA stand
merely "puzzling."
on his screening of many sab-i
stances In laboratory rats. lie'
found several dozen substances
that appear to block or cancel
out the effects of injections of
the mostpowerful'of the cancer-
inducing hydrocabrons. Traces
of these hydrocabons are com-
monly found in cigarette tars.
The phenomenon of blocking
cancer-causing actions has been
known for years. But Dr. Hug-
gins is zealous about Its possi-
bilities.
An example of a long-known
blocking action involves "butter
yellow", an artificial coloring
agent barred from use here butl
used in other countries. Alone,
it is a cancer-inducing product
so it Is barred in the United
States. But a common vitamin
blocks the cancer activity of
butter yellow, so many doubt if
its use elsewhere is actually
harmful.
Dr. Huggtns has carried re-
search into blocking agents
much further.
He seems to believe the pos-
sibilities may be enormous-a
pill; even, that would block the
cancer causing agents in smoke
and, possibly, other cancer-
causing agents, many still uni-
dentified, in the enviroment.
; Dr. Huggins was the re-
searcher who devised the cur-
pently-used treatment for pros-
trate cancer and has advanced
he treatment of breast cancer.
His work on cancer-blocking
substances has been with Dr.
Ryo Fukunishi, assistant pro-
fessor at the lab.

In another report, Dr. Carlos
Martinez of the University of
Minnesota Medical School, said
a new' experimental technique
has opened up possibilities for
transplanting h u m a n, organs
with more assurance of success
than heretofore. _
Describing experiments with
mice, he said that up to now the
most common way of inducing
olerance of grafts or trans-
lants between mice was to
condi.tion the recipient in ad-
vance with the donor's cells.
Dr. Martinez said that In new
tests, the transplanted cells
were broken up and homogen-
ized before being injected into
recipient mice. He said there
were no adverse reactions like
those produced by intact cells.
He thus indicated that event-
ually it might be possible to
prepare a human for an organ
transplant by conditioning him
in advance with homogenized
cells typical of those of a par-
ticular organ.
made the statemcnt in addres-
sing the sixth atlnual 'semi'nar
for science writers sponsored by
the Ameriran Cancer Society.
He did so in commenting on~ a
letter sent to the Federal Trade
Commission recently by Dr.
F. J. L..Blasingame, executive
vice president of the AMA.
In the letter, Dr. Blasingame
said that Congress, not the FTC,
should decide on any limitations
on cigaret advertising, and that
warning labels-as advocated by
the FTC-would not do much
good because people already are
aware of the alleged hazards of
smoking.
"Doctors should take the
lead," said Dr. Ochsner. "This Is
it health problem."
• Referring to the fact that the
AMA has undertaken a long•
range research program on the
subJect of smoking, Dr. Och.
sner continued:
"Personally, I think the AMA
Is wrong. I think we have the
answers right now. Doing more
research is a delaying tactic.°
He added that the AMA
should make a public statement
asserting whether Dr. Blasing-
ame's letter represented ' the
position of the AMA as a whole
or only the doctor's view as an
individual.
But Ochsner Indicated that,
for the present, he took the

'Pentagon Bars Free Distribution
Service Hhs~ ~ ltal
~
Ci •a~r~ette . B~,n
~
By Fred C. Shapiro -
OJ 7hr HeraZd Trtbans Sta/j
Free cigarettes for the 479 U. S. hospitals under the
Pestagon's JurLsdiction have been parading off tobacco
&gt;nziustry assembly lines in countless numbers. They were
donated by service and professiona1 groups, and the in-
dustry itseif-until yesterday.
Yesterday, the parade--almost a tradition-came to
a halt by order of the Defense Department. It acted
after the recent Public Health 8ervice. report on 'smoking
and heaith.
For the Air Force, at any rate, this will mean no
change in policy. It has banned free distribution of
cigarettes In its hospitals for more than a'year. The
Public Health Service instituted a similar ban In its 66
hospitals earlier this week.
The Veterans Administration, which maintains 168
hospitals, passed the buck to local hospital directors, but
aaid many directors have already banned free distribution.
'17iis Is not the case in* New York, where officials of
the local veterans' hospitals agree that patients average
one or two free packs' a week.
°It's just a drop im the bucket to what they smoke,
an4fway,° said Dr. A. M. Kleinman of the Kingsbridge Vet-
erans Administration hospital In the Bronx.
.
NQ COUNT KEPT
Cigarettes are sold In both service and VA hospitals in
eanteens, and In vending machines, and no records are kept
by the government on the number either sold or given away.
-Dr. Kleinman and his fellow directors at the Manhat-
tan and Brooklyn VA hospitals said they had not yet had a
chance to meet' with their staffs to formulate policy on the
donated cigarettes, but that many prohibitions already
exist on hospital' smoking.
Smoking always.has been prohibited In certain areas
of t:ze hospital-in the wards for example, but C. F. IaIeard,,
assistant director of the Manhattan VA hospital, said that
the question of further prohibition is normally' left to the
chief of the hospital service. "In surgical service, for ex-
ample, it has been the decision for some time that the pa-
tients don't smoke."
None the less, the officials of the three New York
area veterans' hospitals said they would be meeting with
their staffs soon-probably this week-to consider whether
they would ban further gifts of cigarettes to all patients.
. The Pentagon, in its announcement, stressed that "no
prohibition is being considered as to the individual pur-
chasing, possession or use of tobacco producta:" but that
It was planning an educational campaign for all per-
sonnel on cigarette smoking hazards.
. Just such a campaign was called for from bhe State
Medical Society yesterday by the chairman of the Special
State Senate Committee on Smoking and Health.
SMOKING DOCTORS -
"You people are. charged with protecting public
health; Sen. Edward J. Speno, Republican of East Mead.w,
L. I., told a Medical Society official at a hearing on pro-
posed anti-smoking laws. "But I go to see these doctors
andthey smoke;, smoke, smoke. What kind of example is
this for children? Why don't you get on the bandwagon?
Why are you dragging your feet?"
The chairman of the Society's Legislative Committee,
Dr. John Carter, read a statement in rebuttal saying that
the legislation is up to the legislators, not the doctors.
Under consideration by the.committee at present.are
bills which would:
CRequire each pack to be labeled with a health warn-
ing or a warning against excessive use.
(TDouble the state tax on cigarettes to 10 cent3, with
revenue earmarked for cancer research and aid: to cancer
victims.

Missing in Johnson's Health Message-
A Reference to U. S. Report on Smoking
(
C
By Stuart H. Loory
of TYs gu.d+ r.ibu.e sa/f
WASHIINGTON.
President Johnson renewed
the plea for hospital insur-
ance for the aged yesterday
as he sent a special health
mei;sage to Congress.
0 e 13-page document,
up to Capitol Hill In
eardy'afternoon to beat Con-
gress' Ltncoin Day recess,
calls for adoption of live
other programs during the
7ear designed to better the
health of the American
people.
The report Is notable, how-
ever, for what It does not
contain. A reference of any
aort to the problems of
cigarette amnkfng and health.
President Johnson has still
not even acknowledged the
existence of the 387-page re-
-port by the Surgeon (3en-
erai a advisory committee
that calls for remedial action
against cigarette smoking as
a health hazard.
* "We must develop effective,
safeguards to protect our
people from hazards In the
air-vYeabreathe, the water we
drink and the food we eaf:"
the President told Congress,
conspicuously avoiding any
reference to tobacco.
The Surgeon (3eneral's
apmmitteemea. after atudy-
fng smoking more than a
3near, decided it wa8 the malor
cause of lung cancer, which
takes 400,000 American lives
a year. The committee felt
that air pollution, on which
the President put great stress,
was an insignificant cause of
the disease in comparison.
The new proposaL In the
Presidential package calls for
expenditure of $19.3 million
to improve nursing schools
and Increase their number.
The program would be a start
toward increasing the nurn- ,
ber of professional nurses
from 550,000 to 680,000 by
1970.
8ome time after the mes-
sage left the White $ouse,
Administration health offi-
cials met reporters and ex-
pressed their confidence in
the adoption of the health
Insurance program - com-
monly called medicare-in
the present session of Con-
gress.
"The Administration be-
lieves some program for
health care for the aged will
be passed this year," one
official said. He based his
prediction on "a series of
discussions we have had with
key members of the legisla-
tive branch."'
The one Congressman who
matters more than all the
rest put together when it
comes to the hospitalization
insurance program is Rep.
Wilbur Mills, D., Ark., chair-
man of the House Ways and
Means Committee. Although
he has shown no evidence of
giving up his long-time oti-
position to the program,
which would be based on an
Increase in Social Security
taxes, the Administration
feels it can change his mind
within the next four or five
weeks.
The plan President'John-
son wants passed is the same
advocated by the late Presi,
dent Kennedy and opposed
strongly by the Amerdcan
MedieaI Association. The Ad-
ministration has taken heart
form support for a similar
plan by Sen. Jacob K. Javits.
R.. N. Y., and a committee
of experts representing hos-
pitals. Blue Cross, private
insurance companies antl
doctors.
The message also called for
adoption of three other pro-
grams now pending before
Congress: Amendments to
the vocational rehabilitation
plan, amendments to the food
and drug laws and establish-
ment of an Insurance pro-
gram to encourage the group
practice of medicine.
Besides the nursing educa-
tion program, it asks for two
other new pieces of legisla-
tion-extension of the Hill-
Burton hospital, construction
program and establishment
of more public health train-
ing grants.
In all„ the health package
would call' for expenditure of
$297.9 million, not counting
the medicare financing from
Social Security.

Department of Agriculture scien-

The department also reports

below last year, and the smallest
in many years.
The 1964 acreage allotments of
flue-cured and burley have been
reduced 10 per cent below 1963,
primarily because record yields

greatly incteased supplies, the

Flue-cured' exports comprised
about 80 per cent of the total

The department said that the
increase in exports was due
largely to the improve&amp; crop.
The exports in 1962 contained a

The United Kingdom boosted
1963 flue-cured imports by two-

` Tobacco Study Planned
Announcement by the U. S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture that it will launch
nonmediately an intensive research pro-
gram into #at-ac" as it may constitute
a health hazard is a step long overdue and
which has been made all the more urgent
by the recent surgeon general's report
on the subject.
The projected study will deal with
technicalities of tobacco smoke, nature
of chemical substances formed by the
burning of known constituents of tobacco,
germ plasm in Ieaf, genetic factors in the
tobacco plant and other aspects of smok-
ing. All these. subjects are too technical
for the layman to understand, but scien-
tists know and can use them to arrive at
conclusions bearing upon the current
controversy. ,..
Adequate facilities are already posses-
sed by the department to proceed with
the research immediately. Of course, the
sooner the better. Meanwhile, Congress
should keep hands off until the experts
come up with something that can form
the basis for such protective measures
and practices as may, be necessary to
make tobacco safe for users.
Regardless of what Congress might do,
millions of Americans are not going to
give up their smoking. That has been
demonstrated by the rapid rebound in
cigarette consumption following the
impact of the initial revelation of the
panel report in mid-January. Purchases
are reported to be back to about where
they were before the report was made
public. All of which means that those
who are of a mind to persist should be
given as much protection as possible.
Rep. Harold Cooley has offered legis+
lation in Congress to make some five
million dollars or more available for a
crash research program. Leading candi-
uate: for gavernor in North Carolina at
this time have favored .tfiC State doing
the research if the Federal government
'd'oes not.
„ This ought not, to be necessary. Cost
I
of the project would be insignificant by
comparison with the more than two bil-
lion dollars a year the Federal govern-
ment derives from, tobacco excise taxes.
If Federal Trade Commission proposals
should actually become law, and if as a
consequence smokers generally abandon
cigarettes, government would be deprived
of a huge amount of revenue. It makes
sense that something be done to avoid
that loss and at the same time, and of
infinitely greater importance, to protect
consumers.
While it is true that North Carolina
has more at' stake than~ any other State,
it is equally true that both~ the Federali
and State. governments profit greatly
from the sale of tobacco products. This
State should neither be expected nor
required to finance the research that is
neededL To do so would be to carry the
burden for the U. S. Treasury and the
other States. Only three States in the
Union - North Carolina, Colorado and
Oregon- do not tax tobacco products,
which means that forty-seven have a
vital interest in, rescuing the industry.
And that justifies action . by Federal
agencies in the government's own inter-
est.

Pesticides-Tobacco Relationship Unknown
By WILLIAM L, NOWARD
No one lqiows what part pesticides sprayed on
tobacco leavetr play in cigarette-induced cancer -
if any.
The reason for this oversight, it now turns out,
is that no one has even investigated
the matter, at least in the halls of
government research. ~ - ,
The fact that such is the case may ~
not be important in Itself, since
cigarettes are loaded with other sub- i
stancea which can cause cancer. The .
addition of minute amounts of pesti-
r.ide 1s p_erhaps_ academic in the total
picture.
But what is Important ls the ea-
planatlon for the oversight. In the W.Ilum Ho...d
eyes of the government, tobacco is an agricultural
commodity so, naturally, it falls under the Jurisdic-
_ _
Scrence Watching
tion of the Agriculture Department. The department's
Jurisdiction,-however-, extends not just from the
grower to the cagarette manufacturer, but all the way
to the consumer at the tobacco counter.
THE FOOD AND DRUG Administration, which
watchdogs almost all other products that are con-
sumed by Americans, has no say-so whatever over
tobacco. Life being full of exceptlons, one might will-
ingly go along with such an arrangement except for
one thing:
Agriculture Department scientlsts don't do much
talking to the FDA men; neither do they go by the
same standards of what constitutes a health hazard.
An example of this large loophole In health
comtnunicatloncamr to light this week In some hear-
ings conducted by Sen. Abraham Rihicoff (D-Conn.):
whose Government Subcommittee is looking into the
pesticide problem,
Testimony from Agriculture Department officials
revealed that just a few days before, a tobacco tn-
secticide, a chemical called Endrin, had been in use
for years by g,rowers.
. . .
WHEN FIRST introduced back In 1953, an official
said, the maximum residue levels of Endrin permitted
on tobacco were 2.5 parts per million, an extremely
small amount. He said this was an "informal" level
established after a telephone conversation with the
FDA, which is in favor of no Endrin on foodstuffs.
Then the agriculture man revealed that the Endrin
- -
residue level on flue-cured tobacco and cigar wrapper
tobacco had tripled or more several months ago. "We
have been aware of the high levels for at least one
year," he said. This prompted the withdrawal order.
However, under questioning by Ribicoff, depart-
ment witnesses conceded that they have no police
-
power, as the FDA possesses, to force farmers to quit
using Endrin. There is no penalty if farmers keep on
dousing It on plants In even great quantities.
If past history is any teacher, Endrin may well
take some time to fade out of the picture. The
surgeon general's report on smoking and health re-
vealed that it took 20 years for the government to
discourage the use of arsenic-based insecticides on
tobacco and remove this hazard from cigarettes. The
battle lasted from 1903 to 1950.
THE VARIOUS scientific witnesses before
Riblcoff, who obviously were talking to each other
for the first time, also lncluded representatives of
FDA and the National Institutes'of Health.
Between them, under questioning, they brought
out that another tobacco lnsectlcide, TDE, sometimes
runs as high as 37 parts per million In fnhaled ciga-
rette smoke. The FDA's allowable maximum residue
of this chemical on foodstuffs like tomatoes Is 5 parts
per million. And presumably even this would be
washed off In preparing the food for consumption.
Endrin Ir thought to be a canccr-causing acent.
But no one knows what it breaks down tnto when
burned in a cigarette, or whether its components
combine with, other substances and becomes more
to,xic.or earcinogenic..

Boys' Club Crusadei"`
Against Smoking Ills
The Meriden Boys' Club is in
the procesa of "going all out"
to evr6 cigarette smoking
arecng its members and to pre-
vent its younger members, who
don't smoke cigarettes, f r o m
atartutg the habit.
Execvtive Director Joseph
Coffey and Patsy Papandrea,
physicai director of the club,
are cooperating in bringing
tihns, literature, lectures a n d
eren club rules into plAly to
empliasiie the evils of cigarette
fmdcag and possible link be-
tween smoking and lung can,
cer before club members and
eren :rto their homes.
The crusade against cigarette
sreolting among club members
begaa Saturday night, the day
bdore the nation embarked up-n on its Cancer Education Week
in an attempt to bring the dan-
=ers of smoking to the public
eye and its possible cause of
1uq eartcer.
Posters Are Up
Boys Club officials have put
up pasters throughout the club
warttiag against cigarette
smoking„ and have provided lit-
eratune printed by the Ameri-
nn Cancer Society and other
ntedicil! research units for the
boys to take home.
"If we can be instrumental in
preventing even one child from
beginning to smoke cigarettes,
thet we've done a job," Cof-
fey said. "I don't think any of
our programs are going to ef-
fect boys 16 years old and more.
Their habits are established. I
don't mean they're over th e
bill: they can quit if they want
to, but their ways are set."
Although Coffey explained at
some length , that many of the
Boys Club members work theih
way iVnto scholarships at An-
dover. Exeter and Loomis acad-
emies and Choate School in
Wallingford through athletic
ability, most of the clab's post-
ers deal, not so much with how

against the dangers of smoking
in posters that detail the amount
of' harm a given number of
cigarettes can do„or tell wheth-
er or not it's too late to quit
smoking.
Parents Must Help
Papandrea said, however, that
lectures, films and warnings at
the Boys Club will do no good
unlesss theb9yk' parents them-
selves sUrx's *or on smoking.
He agreed thaC boys, by na-,to admit, that they do smoke
ture, generally want to be like
their parents more than they
want to be like anyonerlle, and
if the parents smoke cigarettes,
the boy will want to smoke them
so he can rather emulate his
parents than satisfy a desire for
nicotine. -
"If both parents smoke, the
boy in two out of three cases
is going to smoke, no matter
how much they, argue with him
and tell him not to," Papandrea
said.
The literature available at the
Boys Club is keyed more for
consumption by the parents than
it is by the boys, but the club

films that can be understood

roups.
i Papandrea said "not many"
ot the boys in the age group for
Cubs, who range from s:x, seven
and eight years old, smoke cig-
arettes.
"It's the boys 11, 12, 13 and
up that'smoke," he said.
Ages Categorized
The club age groups are the
Cubs„ who are six, seven and
eight; the Midgets, who are nine
and ten years old; Juniors, who
are 111, 12 an&amp; 13; Intermedi-
ates, at 14 and 15 years old;
and Seniors, who range gener.
ally from.16 to 19 years old and
over.
The club also has a rule in
force that if anyone ii caught
smoking In the building, their
activities at the club are sus-
pended for a month.
Papandtea said he, personal-
ly; caught two of the boys smok-
ing an the street one day and
warned them~that it he caught
them again, or even heard of
them smoking, he would sus-
cigarettes. Neither Coffey n o r
Papandrea could guess how
many of the club's 1,200 mem,
bers smoke, The Maloney High
School Rifle Team was practis-
ing on the range. Coffey asked
how many of them smoke and
each said he didni.t. In the cor-
ridor, Coffey asked a group of
three which of them smokes,
and each pointed at the other.
He also asked a group of boys,
apparently in the MidgeEor Jun-
ior groups, how, many of them
smoke cigarettes, and got no
answer at all.
"We are one of the few boys'
organizations in the country, so
far, doing practical work to dis-
courage this habit," Papandrea
said:, "We are trying to combat
it, and are doing everything por
sible to educate the boys to the
bad habits and effects of amok-
ing,,.

"And I know for a fact they

trouble firing in the off-hand

them about the cigarettes they

Papandrea said the club is al-
so working in conjunction with
Mrs. May R. Skeba, chairman
of the Meriden branch of the
American Cancer Society, in

Maine's Antismoking Program
Found To Be Making Progress
This 1s the final article In ,a
s e r i e s an the antismoking
eampai;gn In Maine schools.
~ By PAUL K. MCCANN
Kennebec Journal
When Maine officials laun-
ched their experimental atiti-
smoking campaign in 26 schools
-fn the fall of 1961, they were
breaking a trait In the field.
Their goal was clear: To de-
termine if an educational pro-
gram could nip the problem in
the bud by turning teen-agers
away from the habit.
. Half of the 11,500 students
participating faced a new elass-i
room subJect five times a year,
the pitfalls of cigarette smok-
ing. The others lfivc,lved were
only questioned on their smok-
1ng habits. Data on both groups
was funneled Into the division
of research and vital statistics
of the State Dept, of Health
and Welfare.
The first year proved that
the attitude of the pupils in the
experiment group had been sig-
nificantly influenced-but no
such change was indicated In
their •actual - smoking habits.
Dr. Stanley C. Beckerman, atate
director of cancer control and
his colleagues, however, had1
projected a four-year program,
-one that would enable them
to keep tabs on an entire class
during its high school years.
And they anticipated no quick
results.
A SUItVEY In the fall of
1962 changed their opinions.
D a t a lndicated "significant
changes," particularly among
the freshmen and sophomores.
"It must have happened dur-
1ng the summer months. . . I
still don't know why. . . We weree
very excited;' Beckerman says.
Subsequent checking proved it
was no freak, he added. '
There were fewer regular
smokers (students who smoke
at least one cigarette every day)
In experimental schools than
Sn the other group: Sopho-
mores, who as freshmen the
year before were the youngest
participating students, showed
the greatest change. In experi-
mental schools 18.1 per cent
were regular smokers while In
the second group 22.7 were in
that category. "This was s
atatistically significant differ-
ence, Dr. Beckerman says, be-
cause it set a pattern. "When-
ever we reach them young, we
have s better chance of con-
vincing them."
In visits to participating
schools, the energetic Water-
ville physician who devotes half
his time to private practice
and half to the state job, found
that the teen-agers themselves
believed the program would be
more effective it made avail,
able In lower grades. "They sug-
gested we start In the fifth
grade," he said. And that's one
of the reasons why the expand-
d program will be dffered
tarting at that level.
THE "RIPPLE EFFECTS"
detected by Dr. Beckerman !n
his travels have added to the
weight of the statistical evi-
dence. "Parents have told me
that~r their children are coming
home from school and caution-
ing them against' smoking. . .
I've heard it In several com-
munities."
The success of the experi-'
mentai program indicated iti
was time to expand and the
state has been girding for this
task for months. Even while the
experimental study continues,
Dr. Beckerman said 1,500 Maine
schools have been offered the
materials for establishing anti-
smoking courses.
Dr. Beckermsn, too, said that
he has been In contact with of-
ficials of the Maine colleges.
He said he suggested they elim-
inate cigarette advertisements
from their newspapers. This
has been done.
PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS have
been invited to participate.
He told, too, of suggesting to
one drug chain that it post
signs calling attention to the
fact that the sale, of cigarettes
to persons under 16 Is Illegal.
Dr. Beckerman lauded LaYer-
diere's for taking such a step
and including a health hazard
reminder In the signs. Enforce-
ment of the law on a "volun-
tary basis" would be the cheap-
est and most etfectivg method,
he says. He hopes other cigar-
ette outlets will follow LaVer-
diere's move and eliminate the
need for "cigarette policemen."
"I would like to see the state
blanketed at all levels with an
anti-smoking campaign," he
commented. But he says he and
his colleagLes in the Health &amp;
Welfare and the State Dept.• of
Education take . pride that
"Maine assumed a position of
leadership in a field destined
to assume great importance In
the next decade."

topics studied by the Washington

The board appraved the ap-1
pointment of a staff member oN
the Board of Education to the;
Washington County Committee~
on Smoking Education.
Dr. {iruina B. Burt, who has
been spearheading formation of.

Dr. Burt said he feels that
the most fruitful a-°ca to startl
educatiaig people about the healthl
hazards of smoking is in ele-,
mentary grades.
The committee staged its first ~
meeting Thursday night. Dr.
Bart listed among its possible
objectives the establishment of
a file of literature on smoking,;
providing a source of inedical;
opinions on newly released ma-
building, building, adoption of metal con-
struction for all doors and
frames, aluminum windows
when ever possible, and joining
exterior walkways against ad-
;jacent buildings to simplify
groundskeeping problems.

Smoking Facts To Be Given
Students; TB Group Supports
Anti-Smoking Report
C
C
1
To smoke or not to smoke-
that Is the big questibn that
falls on the heels of the report
of the United States Surgeon
General's Advisory Committee
on Smoking and Health.
The Middlesex Tuberculosis
and Health Association, along
with~ other health agencies, has
become increasingly more a-
ware of the harmful effect that
smoking has on the health of
today's population in Massachu-
setts and the Nation.
There is no doubt~ that heavy
cigarette smoking is harmfuli
to a person's health. Physicians'
and researchers all over the na-
tion and the world have found
unmistakable evidence associat-
ing cigarette smoking with lung
disease as well as disorders of
the heart and circulatory sys-
tern.
The Middlesex TB &amp; Health
Association has sponsored pro-
grams among schools, last year,
Lowell, currently Burlington,
. as weu as clubs and organiz-
ations demonstrating how the
intricate body processes associ-
ated with breathing can be
damaged by smoking. The ex-
tent of the damage is related to
prolonged and heavy smoking
and becomes a serious handicap
later in life.
The particular concern for
teenagers-or even those not
yet In their teens who have
taken up "the habit" at such
an early age. The TB Associ-
ation and its affiliated groups
Is planning an intensified edu-
cational program to show young
people that smoking Is a vicious
hazard for one's health, The fi-
nal decision Is up to the in-
dividual after he has the infor-
mation about the effects of
smoking on personal health.
The moral question, whether
it is "right" or "wrong" to
smoke will not be Included in
the educational program to con-
vince people-young and old--
of the dangers of smoking. The
harm that smoking does lo an
individual's hea..., will be the
only approach to help a person
make his own personal judge-
ment on the question.
The National Tuberculosis
.j,ssociation-of which the Mid-
dlesex Association is a constitu-
ent-issued ihe 'following, state-
ment in May, 1960: .
"The National Tuberculosis
Association warns all persons
that:
-there is an alarming in-
crease in deaths from lung can-
cer
-cigarette smoking is a ma-
jor cause of lung cancer
-the risk of lung cancer in-
creases with the number of
clkaretts smoked
Giving up smoking reduces
the risk of lung cancer.
Recent studies show that
cigarette smoking Is a factor
in such crippling lung diseases
as chronic bronchitis and em-
physema.
There is no single cause for
all lung cancers. Breathing pol-
luted~ city air may also add to
the risk of lung cancer.
No present method of treat~
Ing tobacco or filtering the
smoke has been proved to re-
duce the harmful effects of cig-
arette smoking; up to now.
these harmfulleffects can be a-
voided only by not smoking cig-
arettes.
All persons should be given
these facts. Parents;, teachers;,
and physicians have a special
opportunity and a duty to warn
our youth of these facts before
the cigarette smoking habit has
become established."'
In the final analysis it is the
individual himself-after he
has received the facts-who
must determine whether or not
.he wants to smoke. TB and
health associations wili! give the
facts in order that the individ-
aai may make his decision on an
intelligent basis knowing what
his decision may mean in terms
of his personal' health.

condemning cigaret smoking as a
health hazard.
The board noted the American
Public Health Assn: and the Colo-

similar actions following the. _
Public Health Service report on
smoking in January.
The board elected Dr. Atha

served two 1-year terms.
Dr. Frank Candlin was re-

E. Farrar, Jr., society presi-
dent, said. He said the society
also will press for the re-
moval of cigaret vending-
machines from hospitals and
other public institutions.
As a first step, physicians and
hospital officials willi be survey-

already being done to reduce
smoking," Dr. Farrar said.
SURVEY CHANGES
Physicians also will be polled
on changes in their own smok-
ing habits since the Jan. 11 re-
lease of the Surgeon General's
Advisory Committee report on
smoking and health.
About half of 56,000 physicians
surveyed nationally have chang•
ed their habits since the report,
Dr. Farrar said, a third of them
quitting altogether.
Several other agencies have
announced programs to discour-

The society, in contrast to its
national counterpart, the Amer-

ed some time ago a statement,
warning of the health dangers
of cigaret smoking.
Dr. Farrar said society mem-

Smoking and Health, with the
City Health Department serving

The society's program "will
be coordinated with these other
programs as closely as possi-

The society, in contrast to its
national counterpart, the Amer-

ed some time ago a statement,
warning of the health dangers
of cigaret smoking.
Dr. Farrar said society mem-

Dr. Epple last year proposed
a smoking ban, but the board

Senate Unit SaysCigarettes
Are Responsible for 'Mass
Murder' in This State .
NEW INFORMATION CITED
20% of Deaths Among Men
- 45 to 65 Are Attributed
to Habitual Usage
By LAYFIMOND ROBINSON
8pec4al to The New York TSmes
ALBAlYY, March 8-Ciga-
rette smdking was the principal
killer of one of five men in
New York State between the
ages of 45 and 65 who died from
all causes last year, a Senate
committee said today. -
The Special Committee on
Smoking and Health cited the
figure as evidence that riga-
rettes were responsible for
the "mass murder" of heavy
smokers. .
It said the new information
had been obtained from cancer
researchers at the Roewell Park
Memorial Institute in Buffalo.
"A conservative medical sta-
tistic, which has not been an-
nounced before, t'ells us that 20
per cent of the men aged 45
through 64 who died from all
causes In New Yoik State last
year died because of' cigarette
amoking," the committee said:
Deaths from lung cancer and
cardiovascular and respiratory
diseases, which constituted the
'2o per cent figvre, were "prin-
cipally caused by cigarette
smok/ag " according to Dr..
]Sotton L Levin, chief of Ros-
well Park's department of
epidiemioloscv.
page 68
~ee Hsd (laaoer
"More eltiseoa of this state
are killed each year by lung
cancer caused by cigarette
smoking than by injuries sus-
tained in,automobile accidents,"
the comniittee asserted.
"More frightening, 88 per
oe;lt of.all deaths among men
aged 50 through 69 in this
~tb each year are caused by
clgarette smoking and its re-
lated diseases," the report
added.
The CQmm ittee„ headed by
; Senator ffidward J. Speno, Nas-
sau County Republican; called
for a "declaration of war
against the cigarette."
,;' "The war will be woit if the

once had cancer.
iEie called for research by
companies to develop a "harm-
less" cigarette.
He also • proposed doubling
the 5-cent-a-pack state tax on
cigarettes to raise money for
cancer research and for provid-
irig more state aid to public
schools.
.,The 5-cent increase, he said,
would bring the state $127 mil-
llon more in revenue. About $25
million of that, he said, could
be diverted to cancer research
"to destroy the killer at our
throats."
He said such.research would
be the first major public healt'h
program In the country "di-
rected exclusively to the ciga-
rette and the diseases it eauses: "
The report also called for
legislation requiring labels on
cigarette packages warning
that "excessive use is danger-
ous to health."
Much Statistical Evidence
There has been much statis•
tlcal evidence linking cigarette
smoking to heightened death
rates.
Death rates from lung cancer,
cardiovascular and respiratory
diseases are higher among
smokers than nonsmokers.
Most medical experts do not'
go so far as to say that gll
deaths from these causes can )e
attributed to smoking.

Pamphleteers and idea men
from the Oregon State Board of
Health are planning to stick
their noses into the business of
smoking by high school stu-
dents.
Theboard

ence Feb. 7

Is "out," and

what Is to become Oregon's
war against smoking, the result
of a report by the U.S. surge~n
general that cigarette smoking
Is harmful in a number of ways.
Dr. Leon F. Minear, state
superintendent of public instruc-

He urged Oregon high school

CONSIDERATION GIVEN
The State Board of Health's
war on smoking by students of
whatever age has really just be-
gun, but already some ideas are
making the rounds.
Wade Patterson of the health
education division said consider-
ation is being given by some
college administrators to move
cigarette vending machines off
the campuses. College newspa-
pers may be asked to refuse to
accept cigarette advertising.
The board has written to all
Oregon colleges and universities
"telling them we would help
them In any way that we can,"
Patterson said.
Antismoking workshops for
teachers also are being 'set up.
and the board is taking a sur-
vey of the smoking- habits of
freshmen at Oregon State Uni-
versity, University of Oregon
and Portland State College.
REPORTS DUE
By the end of the current
school year the board will have
a report on every freshman. It
may offer some help to the
board in its campaign to dis-
courage cigarette smoking; pri-
mari{y it will help the board
find in perhaps three years how
well the campaign against
smoking is going.
But it's quite possible the
board will be able to show some
results well before that. At least
it's going to try.

Fight Set
On Smoking
By Youths
Corpus Christi' doctors last
night tool: a public stand de=
ploring smoking by young peo-
pie and agreed to make talks
;on the hazards of tobacco when
~requested by clubs, classes, or
'siniilar organizations.
With one dissenting vote, the.
Nueces County Medical Society
adopted a resolution on smok-
ing which was presented by Dr.
William E. Morris, a member
of the Corpus Christi' school
board:
Citutg the surgeon general's
report in smu-a„g ,v.riit;h "clear-
""``'=-ly documents the dangers and
o, deleterious results of the use of
tobacco," the resolution states
"we are all aware of the harm-
~ fut effects of tobacco on a num-
I.-
"Therefore, be it resolved by
Nueces County Medical Socie-
ty that in view of the document-
ed evidence, it is hereby strong-
ly recommended that a renewed
effort be made to make the pub-
lic and our school children fully
aware of the harmful conse-

"And we further resolve to

society to make himself avail-
able for public appearance in

tobacco to any citizen of our
community."
Dr. Morris said he would not
undertake to regulate the habits
of adults, who should be capable
of sound judgments on the mat-
ter of smoking, but he hoped
a united stand would be of bene•

By WIL,IAM W. PROCHNAU ings on the F. T: C. recom-

.-igaret advertising.
In a letter- to the Federal
Trade Commission, Bucove
said restrictions on cigaret
advertising would be "in the
best interest of public
health" and should he mit
into force immediately.
;gucove's views, along
with those of other state
health directors, were
sought recently by Dr.
George Dobbs, associate
chief of the F. T. C.'s Divi-
sion of Scientific Opinion.

he would go even further

Bucove also said he would

success because of the act
of smoking."
lbleanwhile„ Dr. John S:
Anderson, executive officer
of the Montana Board of
Health, took a dimmer view
of the proposal to label ciR-

said the labels would be a
"form of health education."
"Is it necessary to regu-

derson asked: "To be fair,
the same label should be
placed on alcoholic bev-

OOKS GOOD Ci9C7rets Recovering
From Cancer Report
By Paul Schoenwetter



`
Three months have passed since the Sur-
geon General's Report linked cancer with
sntoking and cigaret sales are nearly back to
normal.
Investors, puffin; away on La Salle and
Wall streets, have indicated their confidence
in the tobacco industry by pushing the lead-
ing cigaret stock prices up to prereport highs.
It appears the tobacco industry will be
ttaping the same profits by the end of' 19641
as they did last year.
IN A SPOT CHECK of grocery stores and
neighborhood' sinoke shops, it was revealed
that while people are buying fewer cigarets in
large quantities, they are buying more in-
dividual packages.
Such firms as National Tea Co. and A&amp;P
sbow a decline in carton sales. The same is
true for drugstore chains. Pipe tobacco an&amp;
cigar sales remain at all-time highs.
T h e tobacco industry admits t h a t
carton -Wes are off, but quickly points out
that sales. by carton as well as package, have
increased' during the past: few weeks. The
total volume of cigaret sales is near, the level
it maintained a year ago.
Venclin.a machine companies report in-
creases in cigaret sales:
Automatic Canteen Co. of America said
sales generally are higher in industrial areas
and are likely to return to the 3 per cent
arou4h rate esperienced last year.
Immediately following the Surgeon Gen-
eral's Report, Automatic Canteen's cigaret
sales dropped 14 per cent, according to
treasurer Don Maxfield. "but we are well on
the road to normal." In Chicago, sales are off
one-tenth of I per cent; nationally, they are
off 1.3 per cent.
AI Rothman, president of Vending Corp:
of America, whose company does a $1,000,-
000 business per year in cigarets, said, "We
took a 10 per cent dip in total volume during
the first weeks, and now we're back to
norma l."
Automatic Retailers of America and its
Chicago subsidiaries also report normal.sales
after the immediate decline. One of the firm's
operating companies in Chicugo reports a 10
per cent increase over 1963. .'
Bob O'Donnell' of General Smokers Service
said his machines show an 8 per cent in-
crease over last year. Cigaret Service Co. re-
ported a 15 per cent rise for March.
AT _'PHE TIME OF; national' introspectionn
into smoking habits, the sharpest drop in
cigaret sales came in the New England'&amp; area,
and, according to the National Automatic
Merchandising Assn., that section~ of the
country is returning to normal as well.
"Theie is no specific pattern of cigaret
sales, other than the fact that those people
trying to cut down are turning to buying
individual packs in vending machines rather
than buying cigarets by the carton," a spokes-
man said.
The general return to normalcy is strongly
reflected in the key tobacco issues on the
New York Stock Exchange. Philip Morris
Inc. hit a 1964 high Friday, closing at 81iYd .
Philip Morris, which produces the country's
eighth-largest selling brand, Marlboro, clo.ed
at 75 on Friday, Jan. 10; the day bef'ore the
smoking-cancer report was made public. The
following Monday it closed at 741/e.
The nation's No. 1 cigaret company, R. J.
Reynolds, producer of Winston, Camel, and
Salem (second, third, and fourth in sales, re-
spectively), was at 421/4 on Jan. 10 and 42-7,
on Jan. 13. Reynolds closed on Friday, at
47i/a, a 1964 high..
The American Tobacco Co. was 28'/i on
Jan. 13 and closed Friday at 35;i,, a 1964
high. American makes Pall' Mall, the No. I
seller, and Lucky Strike, the No. 5 seller.
LIGGETT &amp; MYERS, makers of L&amp; M.
the seventh most popular eigareti also closed
at a 1964 high of 80~/i Friday, after ha\;ng
dipped to 72'/a on Monday, Jan. 13. P. Loril-
lard Co., makers of Kent, neared its 1964
high as well, closing out last.week at 49. It
closed Jan; 13 at 44?/4. 1
All five of the tobacco firms reported
steadily increased sales since the initial drop-
off caused by the report. .

C
NEW YORK (AP)-Mixed among hundreds
of baskets of unfinishe&amp; tobacco pipes in a Brook-
lyn factory are several dozen fille&amp; with brightsed,
yellow and green parts.
When completed these colored pipes will sport
rhinestones embedded in polished, carved bowls.
The pipes are only five inches long, designed to
atiract women.
A newspaper advertisement
rages readers to try a"safety
dgarette that looks like a cig-
aelte, feels like a cigarette
and satisfies like a cigarette-
but: you never lightup." The
aosufacturer at this clove-.
acsnted imitation of a cigarette
guarantees money back it it

teai iem.

a cmt6sner receives antismok-
teg lRerature and a short lec-
ture wtsea he buys cigarettes.
"We don't )ast tell them you
expL-tin &gt;ltoulda't stoake butwe try toa~ : says the chief
Colored pipes for women, in-
tensified antismoking cam-
paigns and a flood of cigarette
substitutes are among the many
signs of what some experts con-
sider the most critical period
for the seven-billion,dollar U.S.
tobacco industry since John
Rolfe planted his first tobacco
cop350yearsago.
Last month a scientific panel
m®vened by the surgeon gener-
a1 of the Unitedi States branded
cigarette smoking a hazard to
bealth, a cause of lung cancer
and a contributing factor to oth-
er diseases. Remedial' action
was urged,
Cigarette sales immediately
dropped; Some guesses on the
size of the dtop ran to 30 per
cent

Sales apparently are rebouno
Ing now. A nationwide Associ-
ated Press survey of retailers,
distributors and wholesalers in-
dicates that sales remain below
the levels before the report was
released, but that the prevailing
movement is upward in at least
12 of 17 major cities sunveyed.
These 12 i;nclnded Kansas City,
Pittsburgh, San Francisco.
Cleveland, New Orleans and
Denver.
"I think there will be a quick
return to almost normalcy,"
said Morris Shlensky; president:
of Katz Drug Ca.~, a large Mid-
western chain. "Most customers
seemed to take it as a lark. It
bas been fashionable to say, 'I
page 75
have given up cigarettes".°
Many in the industry agree.
Among the nation'a major
cigarette manufacturers only
one has given any direct indica-
tion of recent sales. R. J. Reyn•
olds Tobacco Co., the No, 1 cig-
arette maker, said that orders
being placed by wholesaler dis-
tributors "indicate a drop na-
tionally in retail sales of our
products which is more than
normal at this time of year."
The attitUde of the major,
companies was summed up by
the representative of one:
"There was no new material in
the report; it' was the same old
thing. There is no sense quar-
rding publicly about it; every-
one will forget most of it in
time. We know more study is
needed' and were all for that."
Another indicator of sales is
cigarette tax receipts: A check
of January figuresfor 19 states
showed 16 declines from Janu-
ary 1963., However, iomorethan
half the cases where state offi-
cials commented; they said the
"smoking and health" report
could not clearly be blamed.
Declines in cigarette tax re-
ceipts ranged from an estimat-
ed 3 per cent in California to 13
per cent in, Rhode Island. The
average was 8:3per cent
In four cases-New York.
Rhode Island, New Hampshire
and Ohio-state officials be-
lieved the report was definitely
responsible.
Factors that: confused the pic-
ture included purchases of tax
stamps a month or two in ad-
vance and bulk purchases of
stamps basedon money avail-
able for taxes rather than on
cfgarettessold or ordered.Sev
9 ll state officials said it' was
early to determine the true
effect of the report.
One fact was clear. The de•
mand for cigars, pipes and
smoking tobacco has -akyrock-
eted.
"It's like Christmas in Febru-
ary. We've got so, many pipe
orders we don't know what to
do;" said I. C. Legros. president
of Shulick Taylor Distributing
Co. in Wheeling. W. Va.

DURHAMMORNING HERALD February 20, 1964 ( Cont'd. )
"We've gotten rid of some
pipes we never could selli before
-even the corncobs are going
fast'." said T. M. Bolles of
Patrick McRee Tobacco Inc., a
majrx Richmond. Va., outlet.
George Watnick, a partner of
tlie knickerbocl:er firm that re-
sumed making women's pipes
after a six-year lapse. agreed.
'Tve never seen a surge of de-
mand like this and I've been in
the business since 1924." -
"We've got a backlog of three
manttt,s on orders, possibly
more," be added. "lhey're
driving me crazy with these
weaea"s pipes. I can't make
enough of them."
Major cigar manufacturers
conflaTned the demand.
"Dur January sales sky-
rocketed. February is even bet-
tcr. It's that way all over the
country," said E. Archie Mist1-
Eia, president of Bayuk Cigar
Co.. Phiiadelphia.
`"f9ycre has been a tre-
mendaas number of people just
trying cigars and a great surge
of interest in small cibars." said
Harold Edeson, sales promotion
manger of General: Cigar Co.,
New York.
But oae industry source cau-
tioned: "No one really knows if
this will hold or whether every-
oae will I go back to cigarettes."
Meanwhile, the companies
tha#t made most of the 511 bil-
lion cigarettes puffed' by an es-
timated 70 million tJ.S. smokers
last year are sitting back and,,
as one tobacco man put it,.
"tiaaiting to be told what they
viti be allowed to do and what
they won't be permitted to db."
Part of the answer may come
after a March 16 Federal Trade
Commission hearing on rules
that would drastically restrict
cigarette advertising. The FTC
proposals would require each
cigarette package and adver-
tisement to display prominently
a warning that cigarette smok-
mg is hazardous to health and'
may cause cancer and other
-
diseases.
Cigarette company adverfis-
in° is estimated at 3150 to $200
million annuaily.
Tw-o major crnnnanies have
made advertising changes since
the smoking report. But all
maintain they have not cut total
advertising outlays or altered
basic policy.
A spokesman said Reynolds
has "repositioned, not cut
back" expenditures for spot ra•
dio commercials to avoid chil-
drens' listening hours. The
money will be shifted to reach
adult radio audiences, he said.
As part of a continuing pro-
gram American Tobacco Co.
dropped sponsorship of sports
events on television and radio.
"We are leaning over back-
wards to show we believe smok-
ing is for adults and to be sure
we are not misunderstood,"
said Robert' Heimann, vice pres-
ident.
He added that last year ad- i
vertising expenditures reached a
record high, and this year they
will be increased by the intro- I
duction of a new brand. t
Since the report, the National
Geographic, Saturdt{y Review,
Parents and Sunset magazines
have dropped cigarette adver-
tising. On the other side a na-
tionwide group of 35 local and
regional monthly magazines so-
licite&amp; more cigarette advertis-
ing after finding readers "ex-
pressed a strong desire to eval-
uate advertising for them-
selves."
Another development has
been~ a reduction, of the work
week for an undetermined num-
ber of the industry's nearly 100,-
000 factory workers. Three orr
four day work weeks were or-
dered for some plants by each
of the major makers.
All the companies empha-
sized' that a slow period normal-
ly develops each year after
Christmas. They said' some re•
ductioii in the work schedule
has been customary over the
years.
American an&amp; Lorillard ad-
mitted some of the softness in
sales may have been due to thee
reportl A Philip Morris spokes-
man noted that "everyone fie-
ures we all ought to ~ be back on
full production by March."
The major cqmpanies have
contrihuted to, a~ $10-million
grant to the American Medical
Association's long range study
on the relationship between
smoking and disease.
At the same time a proposal
that would permit the Agricull
ture Department to undertake
research into the hazards of to-
bacco products at! a cost of $10
million~ annually was progress-
ing through Congress.
On the state level projected'
legislation covers the field of
controls over the sales and ad-
vertising of cigarettes. Some
states already have laws ban-
ning sales of cigarettes to mi-
nors.
Makers of many types of pills,
tablets, gum and lozenges de-
signed to cut the desire to
smoke reported an extended i
sales boom. I
Experts on the tobacco indius- f
try generally don't feel these
substitutes will have much of an
over-all effect on cigarette sales,
"I feel there wilL be a drop in
(cigarette) consumption of 5 to
15 per cent over the first half of
the year, from a year ago," said
one of the experts, Oren Knauer
of, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., an
advisory service. "The decline
should gradually diminish and'
turn into an increase over a
year ago by the second half,"
he added.
He feels cigarette company
stocks are selling "quite low
and should not go much lower."'
They have not shared in
the general rise of the market'
since 1961 when they hit their
alltime peaks.
In the month following the re-
port, the stocks of five major
tobacco companies traded! on
the New York Stock Exchange
declined an average of less than
$1 a share. One issue, Ameri-
can Tobacco, was about un-
changed. Li;vett &amp; Myers was
up about $6 a share and' the
others were off, about $2, $3 and
$5.
Richard Toole; tobacco ana-
lyst for E. F. Hutton Co.. a
brokerage firmi believes there
was little market response to
the report because the report's
conclusions were anticipated.

Cigaret Sales Rebounded Sharply in March;
Health Scare Has Worn Of f, Retailers Say
A WALL STREET JOURNAL NRtOa Roundup
Smokers are puffing nearly as many ciga-
rets as they ever did, within three months after
the Government report that linked smoking
with cancer and heart disease.
A Wall Street Journal survey of tax reve-
nue data from more than a score of states
Indicates cigaret sales last month rebounded
atrat'ply from the "health-scare" lows set im-
mediately after the study was released Jan.
11. And, in a dozen states, the recovery carried
March volume ahead of the year-earlier pace
by as much as 9%.
"It's just like any scare," observes Rus-
•etl Hungerford of the Alabama revenue de-
partment. "A lot of people swore off but found
they couldn't take it."
'Getting Back to Normal'
Concurs a tax agent in Wisconsin: "It be•
gins to look like the effects of the scare is
over and we're getting back to normal."
The recovery pushed cigaret tax collections
in California last month to ;6,269;704, up 3.62%
from March 1983. In February, sales had
been down 10.11% from the 1963 level, and the
decline in January had been 7.73~Jo.
Rhode Island's cigaret tax receipts spurted
6.8% last month after falling 13% in February
from the year-earlier month. "The tobacco dis-
tributors had been telling me that their sales
were gaining so fast they would be ahead in
March„ but P was skeptical," one Rhode Islt;nd~
agent recalls. "But sure enough;" he concedes,
"they were right."
Maryland"s March gain was 9.14%a from a
year before, in contrast to a 9.4% drop in Feb-
ruary and a 5% decline in January.
In a number of states, cigaret tax receipts
last month still trailed the 1963 level, but the
percentage decline was significantly smaller
than It had been earlier. In New Mexico, for
instance, the drop-off from 1963 was 0.7~4~ in
March. far short of the 14.2% decline in Feb-
ruary: Connecticut's decline leveled off to 6:6%,
in March from 14% the month. before.
New York State's cigaret tax revenue re-
boundedlast month to $8,549,764, off only 0.5%
from the $8,595,584 volume of a year before.
In February, tax receipts had been down
18.8% and a 4.71,, decline had been recorded
in January from the year-earlier levels. Rev-
enue "seems to be on the upswing." notes
Joseph H. Murphy, New York's tax commis-
sioner.
William Kingsley, New Jersey tax director,
reports an "amazing rebound" in his state's
sales of cigaret tax stamps. Sales of the
stamps totaled 68,118,050 during March, up
2.7V,~ from the March 1963 total of 66,313,750.
In contrast, February stamp sales totaled
54,048,350;, off 15,78/n from the 64,172,000 of a
year earlier; January sales amounted to
63,717,100, down 5.63~/o from 67,520;150 in Jan.
uary 1963.
The state tax data confirms some earlier
optimistic statements from cigaret manufac-
turers. Last week, for example, both, American
Tobacco Co. and Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco
~
Co. told their annual meetings that March
sales topped the 1963 levels.
Yesterday, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. told
its stockholders' meeting that Reynolds sales,
too, have increased steadily in recent weeks
and it is possible the company's first quarter
earnings will be about at the year-ago level.
However, Bowman Gray, Reynolds chairman,
said first quarter dollar sales will be about
61/2% lower than a year ago.
Cigaret retailers also confirm the rising
trend. Warren Alberts, president of George
Melhado &amp; Co., a Boston tobacco wholesaler,
says his sales "so far in April are a little
ahead of a year ago."
In Cleveland, Louis Klein Cigar Co. says
,Its sales, too, are "pretty much back to nor-
mai." And Robert F. Burns, merchandising
manager for Ralph's Grocery Co., Los Angeles,
agrees that "the scare's worn off."
Some retailers concede they are surprised
by the sales resurgence. "I can't understand
it,"says Isidore Alterman„chairman and presi-
dent of Alterman Foods, Inc., which operates
the 58-store Big Apple supermarket chain in
Georgia. He says his chain's cigaret sales fell
60q~ from a year before when the Government
report was released, but he says volume in
the past two weeks has topped last year's pace
by 5%a. Speculates the executive: "Maybe. peo-
ipie are starting smoking again because they
like a challenge."
Allied Supermarkets, Inc., a Detroit-head-
quartered grocery chain with more than 200
stores in the Midwest and Southwest, reports
a similar recovery. The chain says sales fell
12%a in January, recovered to within a fraction
in February and, by last month, were up 3%
from the year-earlier month.
Filter Tip Sales Are Stronger
Not all cigaret brands, however, are shar-
ing equally in the sales comeback. According
to Joseph Porter, a vice president of the 30-
store Giant Eagle Markets, Inc., "filter tips
like Tareyton, Kent and Lark are running far
lahead of last year and old nonfilter brands
,are taking a terrific beating." But he says the
jong nonfilter Pall Mall is "still No. 1" In
sales at the Pittsburgh-area chain.
Pipes and pipe tobacco also continue to post
sales gains from the 1963 level, chiefly be-
cause -that form of smoking was rated rela-
tively less harmful than cigaret smoking by
the advisory committee to the U.S. Surgeon
General: "Each night before going to bed we
bless the Surgeon General," says one tobac-
conist in the Washington area who sells all
t'obacco products except cigarets.

ADVERTISING
Bernbach Blows Holes
in Some Pet Theories
BY RONALD J. OSTROW
Tima SfaM Wrlter
C
"I don't believe you should
advertise cigarettes. They're
bad for your health. You're
just selling sickness, and I
don't want to be responsible
for it."
The man who voiced the
opinion doesn't Fepresent
the surgeon general's offiee;
nor does he occupy a lofty
ivory tower, removed from
the daily grit of business and
commerce.
He's William Bernbach,
president of Doyle Dane
Bernbach, Inc., advertising
agency.
He was recently selected
by his fellows as "The man~
who contributed most to
advertising in 1963." Bern-
bach held a press conference
here Thursday.
For Five Years
His agency has created
such successful ad cam=
paigns as the Volkswagen
effort ("Think Small"), the
Avis Car R e n t a 1 drive
("We're No. 2, and we try
harder") and the Ohrbach's
series of ads, which included
the now famed cat wearing
a fancy hat.
D o y 1 e Dane Bernbach
hasn't accepted a Cigarette
account for five years.
tuivugn some makers have
approached the agency. Its
branch in Germany, howev-
er, does handle a cigarette
client, "but it's part of an
agency we bought into,"
Bernbach said.
His anti-cigarette stance
typified some strong opi-
nions on the subject of
advertising that Bernbach
issued from the executive
suite at Ohrbach's Wilshire
store. He was in Los Angeles
to confer with Kermit Clast-
er, Ohrbach's executive vice
president, on the chain's
Panorama City store, which
will open in the fall.
• On research In advertis-
ing: "Research tends to per-
petuate mediocrity. You give
back to people what they
gave to you. Research can't
think for you.'
• On advertfsing's role in
society: "Anyone with~ any
talent at all has a responsi-
bility to express: that talent
in a social way."
Evidencing that he prac-
tices his preachments is his
agency's handling without
fee campaigns for the Lin-
coln Center for the Perform-
ing Arts in New York and
ads urging support for the
nuclear test' ban.
• On "planning ho.ards,"
where ad men sometimes
propose campaigns and sug-
gest they be "run up the
flagpole": "We don't have
any plans board' where
people vie with each other.
Copywriters come in (my of-
fice) all day long,"
• On combining advertis-
ing and public relations be-
neath one agency roof: "I
don't think there's any link
between public relations and
advertising. We don't have a
PR department. They're two
different businesses entire-
ly.".
• On cleverness in adver-
tising: "Cleverness for the
sake of cleverness, I abhor."
But when the cleverness is
generated from the product
itself, "that's another story."
No matter how "creative"'
an ad campaign, Bernbach
contended it wou]d he
doomed to failure if the prod-
uct failed to support the ad-
vertising's claims.
He said "getting be~ieved"
ranks as "the most important
ingredient in advertising."
Doyle Dane Bernbach is
currently billing at an annu-
al rate exceeding $I100 mil-
loin, Bernbach said! That(,
would compare with last
year's volume of $8.~ million.

David S. Ogilvy. chairman

an advertisin- agency that
does not accept cigarette a.c-

The economic Importance

Tobacco 1n.5titute also voiced
objection to the prugr.vr's
title„ "Cigarettcs_- A Coll:-
sion of lntcrests" on the
ground that cigarette com-
panies were as concerned with
pabtic health as with eco-

•
But the fresher and nurre
interestin;; phase tif the pro-

over whether the mrdical ad-
vice against smoking would
be her~ded; its findings were
not bna•ouragin,;.
On thi.c score. In fact, the
C.B.S. protiram had one glar-
ing areakiu~c&lt; it did not docu-
nucnt in detail the strong re-
sur~rnce in cigarette sales
durir.g, the month of March
and the rise in tobacco stocks,
both matters that': were well
covercd by C.B_S. News ear-

If the i?suc of cigarette smok-

PRINTER'S INK
Apri1 10, 1964
Third of ad execs
give up cigarettes
Three months have passed since the
Surgeon General's report laid a live
bomb in the lap of the cigarette indus-
try. Whether or not the bomb explodes
depends on the actions taken by the
government, the tobacco industry and,
most importantly, the consumer.
The tobacco advertisers don't dare
rock the boat, and the government
seems destined to play its role slowed
down in a bind of red tape.
In an effort to get the ad man's re-
actions to the report, PAINTEAS INK
put to its Executive Panel several
searching questions regarding the pan-
ers thoughts on the subject.
That the report had a significant
effect is reflected by the 35 per cent
of the panel reporting that they stopped
smoking cigarettes altogether, and an
additional 15 per cent stating that
they cut down their puffing. Of the
half who said they are continuing to
smoke, almost one-third reported they
smoke cigars or pipes (this includes
"old" and switch smokers). These fig-
ures would indicate that the report has
had a definite restrictive effect on ex-
isting smokers.
- Only 17 per cent of those polled
expect the affair to blow over, as it did
in Englarxi, for instance. Nor does the
majority of the panel express desire
for it to fade; 72 per cent suggested
various actions that the government
page 81
should take, ranging from a national
educational program to strict enforce-
ment of an outright ban for the under-
age.
The study rcvealed very little sym-
pathy expressed for the cigarette indus-
try, with a mere two per cent stating
that the industry should do nothing in
the wake of increasing criticism of its
products. Paths to take? Research, said
a whopping 63 per cent.
As for the future, the panelists see
change in the wind. Advertising will
be further modified, thought 88 per
cent, and media will be restricted,
stated 68 per cent. As to definite
changes, there is some doubt; but most
panelists who expect change feel that
the emphasis will go toward limiting
cigarette exposure to minors. Other
opinions saw alterations in ad copy
qnly.

Jt7tTRIftAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
March 7, 1964
SMILE A WHILE
iaugtj to 3kIap Nour Cpitapb
Anecdotes submitted by physicians concerning their
practice or patients are welcomed for consideration.
Piping Aboard the Smoker
-After the Advisory Committee had
released its report on the ill effects of
smoking. I observed the number of
commuters in the smoker car who had
obviously taken a firm resolve to free
themselves of the smoking habit,
which resolve had the immediate ef-
fect of diminishing to a remarkable
degree the amount of smoke in the
car itself.
The "resoEutes" continued to oc-
eupy seats in the smoker car, from
babit, from taking a vicarious pleasure
an inhaling the smoke that hung
whistfully and tauntingly on the air
of the car, or most probably from a
secret desire to be corrupted into
breaking their resolve and taking up
the evil habit once again,
Each day since, the smoker car has
seen an increase in the atmospheric
density, and each increase in the den-
sity has seen a decrease in the num-
ber of "tabacco givers-up." It is inter-
esting to eavesdrop on conversations,
to capture the changing resoluteness
and reshaping of -attitudes.
The first day one heard things like
'That s it fcn- me. No more. I threw
the pack away. Probably save money.
-tno, Nasty habit anyhow. Actually it's
offensive to thme around you. Yessir,
this one I'm smokin' is the last one."
A week later one could hear these
gcrn,s: "I'm trying to cut down. If I
gave it up altogether, I'd gain twenty
pounds. My doctor never really told
me to quit smoking, although he did
say I should try to e.LCe up a bit."
Some time later it became more
difficult to discern any discussion
whatever about the subject, the "giv-
ers-up" and the "almost givers-up"
becoming mute in the determination
of their resolve or becoming dispirited
with the lack of personal' strength in
continuing that same resolve.
A few jaws have wagged! hopefulh~
wrestling with chewing gum, working
to sublimate the `bral-pleasure-ori-
ented drive." Philosophical staring out
of the window and viewing the scenes
flashing past has become a character-
istic activity. Working crossword puz-
zles has been taken up by a few as a
substitute habit, adding new frustra-
tions for respective psyches to face
(eg, not completing the puzzle).
Now there is only a rare reference
made to the habit of' smoking aboard
the smoker car. Sometimes a query is
raised: "Where'd you get that pipe,
Henry?" And Henry says, "Wife got
it for me. Imported. Cost five dollars.
Tastes awful."
The smoker car is again filled with
smoke, only more so, as some of the
"cigaret givers-up" have switched to
cigars, and there has become an added
essence to the whole scheme of "tran-
sition." Aroma now becomes a sig-
nificant factor in the challenge faced
by some and in the acceptance al-
lowed by others. More than once have
I heard a friend of one who has dis-
coucred cigars outcry, "Eureka."
UnxERYER

SMOI:I\G WITHOUT CON1NiERCI_YLS ...
sr CIIARLES W. MORTON
Asa longtime readr r of the medi'l eal men pub3ishcd by the Tobacco
Ittstit...c, I felt somewhat let down
by the r,,overnment's report that
smoking is bad for the health and
so on. Not that I believed every-
thing the insu. _te was srnding mc,
for I am insuflicicndv the expert to
endorse or contradict .he findings of
doctors, but I did ;ct the broad
impression from their writings that
there was nothing likc a tobacco
addiction to tirightc'n the eye and
quicken the step and maintain the
suioker im a state of chronic good
health. Tobacco was not yet ac-
cepted as a sprc:fic ior various dis-
tases, I gathc: :, but ir would be
erroncous to tL .il' that it caused' or
contributed to any of them.
Other author.:ics argued the con-
trary, so that i. vie..s expressed in
the governmcr. report were not
altogethcr nc- But the advance
publicityprcccc_ ..g thcir publication
had been so f:u cy that one had ex-
pccted something more than a reit-
eration of what most British and
American expcri, had'found against
tobacco in recent years. I realize
now.that was foolish of me, but I did
allow the advancc ballyhoo to make
me think that something smashing
1
was impending. On mulling inovcr,
I bcgan to wondbr if'~somc widc pro-
hibition of tobacco advertising might
be recommended.
The possibility of no tobacco ad-
vertising was fascinating. What
would follow? How L..uld the public
be informed of the ceaseless triumphs
of research so conscientiously dis•
closcd by the cigarette makers in
their television commercials?
Without the cigarette commer-
cials, what is pcrhaps .: major area
of A--terican life will go into eclipse.
No more shall we see the doughty
rock-climbers, the speedboat drivers,
skin divers, athletes, motor racers,
bronc riders rewarding their exer-
tions with lungfuls oH cooling, heal-
ing, relaxing, stimulating, rich-mild
smoke. Blacked out from us, alsoa4
will be the whole world of filter re-
search and discovcry. the Gi, at long-
term drive by advcrtisii:q,scientistr„
which makes the space and moon-
shot programs seem a pal try show by
comparison.
The torch will pass fro:n the grasp
of' advertising, but it %,ili still be
carried by thc frce and competitive
press. Events of this magnitude can-
not go long unnoticed, and news
gatherers will be quick to accept the
page 85
challenge. A tnajor wire service tcill
boast that it has beaten all cotnpeti-
tion in ftrst flashing the discovery of
the new filter that automatically
includes two puffs of air with every
puff of smoke. "Coolcr! Richcr!
Milder!"' the report will go. "and
Berserk Kews Intcrnational was first
with it by ninctacn and a half' min-
utes!"
But perhaps there tl ill be the re-
porter who telephones his desk in a
rare state of excitement: "I'm~ on
something big!"
"Yeah? What is it?"
"Get this, CHief: a cigarette filter
that spins the smoke."
"We don't want it."'
"roU (!•On!t 7L'.ant ;/J'•.
"Forget it. Hop over righv away
to the Kiwanis lurch."
Alli these musin;s, I realize. may
prove premature„ for the last word
has by no means been, heard in the
controversy. The cigarette peoplt
want to look into it all a: biv furtllcr„
and only a few weeks bcforc the gov-
ernment's report, .ame a rcallcarth-
shaker from the dtar old ASIA. It
was the lead story in the A\IA ,\'eu•s„
and it may, well put the whole sub-
ject im the cooler for some pcars, to
come. "The American '.vfedical As-
sociation will undcrtakc,"' &gt;o the
story went, "a comprehensive pro-
gram of research on tobacco an&amp;
health."
