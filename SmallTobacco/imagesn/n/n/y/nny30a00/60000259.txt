On Ulcer Therapy
Sir: I read the article on ‘“Contro-
versies-in Ulcer Therapy” (MWN, June
23) with interest.
Some years ago, I discarded the’
theory of hyperacidity as a total
‘ cause for the presence of the benign
duodenal or gastric ulcer, and decided
that the Sippy diet was inadequate.
Benign duodenal or gastric ulcer is

 

a multifaceted disorder involving not
only hyperacidity but hypermotility,
infection, allergy, and local endarte-
ritis obliterans. Although I am a sur-
geon, I recognize that adequate medi-
eal therapy for the benign ulcer must
include eradication of any or all of the
above factors in order to satisfac-
torily rectify the disease.

‘The Sippy diet was discarded by me
because it not only did not clear all
the symptoms but left the patient
weak and unhappy. With the treat-
ment that I followed [which begins
with placing the patient on a milk-,
wheat-, and egg-free diet] not only
was relief frequently obtained, but
there was an absence of the monot-
ony of a milk and cream diet. Often

dramatic symptoms of well-being ©

were encountered, particularly if [an
allergy to} milk was [causing the
disorder]... .

Sir: I have just read with interest the
article “Controversies in Ulcer Ther-

F1EqICSi VVC CWE em

apy.” There are many ideas put forth
about medication, diet, and rest, but I
was greatly disappointed that no one
mentioned anything about the effect
of cigarette smoking on peptic ulcers.

I have been in general practice for
41 years in the western part of Cin-
cinnati, and although I have not kept
the kind of statistics that research
people do, I have come to some very
firm conclusions about the relation-
ship of smoking to ulcers.

In fact, I have had many patients
come to me with recurrent ulcers—
having been treated by other doctors
without success—who healed their ul-
cers within a few weeks when the
abolition of smoking was added to
their daily routines. I have also had
many other patients who did not stop
smoking and who had recurrences, al-
though they stayed on a diet and
[took] antacids.

As a result of this experience, for
the past 20 years I have refused to
treat all ulcer patients unless they

‘ would promise to stop smoking per-

manently.

Sir: “Controversies in Uleer Therapy”
interested me very much in that at
this late hour in medical history con-
troversy should exist on the subject.

Certainly there is a consensus that
if you can maintain neutralization of
the gastric acidity and establish con-
comitant normal digestion through-
out the gut, you are going to heal the
ulcer—providing the area has not
been so cicatrized [that] normal arte-
rial, venous, and lymphatic movement
to [it has been completely cut off].

When this has occurred, a gastro-
plasty or duodenoplasty would appear
to be entirely proper.

But a vagotomy at qny time sug-
gests .. . surgical-medical incompe-
tence in the fields of diet, psychothe-
rapy, and physiology.

Sudden Loss of Hair Pigment

Sir: The article “White from Fright—
or Lack of Henna?” (mwN, June 23)

brings to mind my critical evaluation
of the subject 40 years ago in Hand-
book der Haut und Geschlechtsk-
rankheiten, (Vol. 4, Part II, 1011-
1221), edited by J. Jadassohn and
published by Julius Springer Verlag
in 1988. The article I wrote for that
collection was titled ‘Pathological
Pigmentation of the Skin (and Hair)
in Internal Medicine, Neurology, and

Psychiatry.”

Gradual graying of the hair is fe
netically determined. But there’ is
abundant evidence that canitieg, or
premature depigmentation of /air,
can result from continued severe
stress. However, as [your article re--
porting the views of] Dr. Joseph E.
Jelinek. correctly states, sudden whi-

tening of hair—e.g., overnight or in a |

day—is still disputed as it was 40
years ago, largely because it is Very

 
  

complete, one partial, of relatively
rapid development in young soldiers
in World War I. To be exact,
eannot be accepted as cases
nities subita sive acutissima because
the individuals were not seen imme-
diately before and after the occur-
rence. This requirement is seldom ful-
filled.

The effect of disorders of the ner-
vous system (especially the sympa~
thetic), as well as metabolic and endo-
crine disturbances, on skin and hair
are well established but rarely come
to the attention of the dermatologist.
Aside from their diagnostic signifi-
eance and scientific interest, abnor-
malities of the pigment do not cause
any therapeutic stir.

_ It may be for this reason that the
questions of the formation of air or
gas bubbles [in the hair shaft, produc-
ing a white appearance] has not been
settled, which one would expect, con-
sidering the advanced technology of
electron microscopy. I have seen un-
der the microscope (at a magnifica-
tion of x 1600) the disintegration of
the medullary area of the shaft of a
diseased whitened hair, while the cor-
tex was relatively intact. .
