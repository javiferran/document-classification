Gordon gladly trades bravery
for maturity, more victories

NAZARETH, Pa. (AP) — Robby
Gordon says he isn’t quite as
brave as he used to be. .

But don’t get the wrong idea.
The change is simply a measure
of the growing maturity of the 25-
year-old Indy-car driver.

“| was a braver driver three
years ago,” Gordon said Friday
between practice sessions for
Sunday's Bosch Spark Plug
Grand Prix at Nazareth Speed-
way.

“I feel I’m a better driver today
in taking calculated risks instead
of just making instant decisions,”
he said. “‘Most of all, though, I
want to win races, When it comes
to the last 20 laps, we’re going to
just suck it up and go for it.”

With two races remaining, Gor-

: don, in his second full season on

. the Indy-car circuit, is locked in a
tight battle with Michael Andretti
and Paul Tracy for third place in
the season standings. .

Al Unser Jr., winner of eight of
14 races this season, already has
locked up the season title and
Emerson Fittipaldi is virtually as-

points.

_Going into today’s qualifying
on the one-mile oval, Andretti, a
former series champion, holds
third place with 114 points, fol-
lowed by Tracy with 109 and Gor-
don with 104. Nigel Mansell, the
defending series champion who
will return to Formula One next
season, is a longshot for third
place with 83 points and a maxi-
mum of 44 remaining.

teammates on the powerful Marl-

Ilmor-powered Penskes.

“If you can split the Penskes,
you've definitely done something
with a Lola chassis this year,”
Gordon said. “And to be ahead of
Mansell, who is using the same
equipment, well, that tells you
what a great job the guys on the
Walker Racing team have done
this year.”

Gordon feels so good about the
way the team has developed this
year that he has signed a two-year
contract extension with an option
year in 1997. y
