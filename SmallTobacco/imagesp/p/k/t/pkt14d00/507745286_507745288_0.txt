R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company is pleased to announce a retail

HORIZON Brand. More importantly, it will reward you with CASH for
helping us make smokers aware of HORIZON Kings and 100's.

Starting April 1, 1991, HORIZON buttons will be made available for
you to wear. In addition, we would like you to remind all smokers
--except WINSTON and SALEM smokers--to try HORIZON (must be 18
years of age or older).

It's simple and exciting to win!

Between April 1 and June 30, a HORIZON Mystery Shopper will be
shopping your store. All you have to do is be spotted by a HORIZON
Mystery Shopper: .

1. Wearing your HORIZON button to win $10.00.
2. Mentioning to all smokers except WINSTON and SALEM
smokers, "Have you tried HORIZON?" to win $50.00.

And there's more! When you win, your store owner or company wins,
too! Because R. J. Reynolds will award your store owner or company
the same_ cash payment that you receive.

Additional HORIZON comments, should the consumer ask, are:
@e HORIZON is the first cigarette that smells good.

e HORIZON has the smooth tobacco flavor that you expect ina
cigarette.

Also, be sure to give your customers one of the "Question & Answer"
sheets included in this package. It's sure to answer their
questions about HORIZON!

The Mystery Shopper will visit all the participating stores in your
area looking for HORIZON buttons and listening for you to say,
"Have you tried HORIZON?" These stores will be chosen at random,
but every store will be visited at least once--and most more than
once!

Join the excitement now and win up to $60.00 instantly. There's
plenty of cash for you on the HORIZON if the Mystery Shopper spots
you!
