TITLE OF RESEARCH PROJECT:
THE COMBINED ROLE OF TOBACCO SMOKE CONDENSATES, AVITAMINOSIS AND
ALCOHOL IN THE ETIOLOGY OF ORAL CANCER
INTRODUCTION :

During the past twelve years IT, as well as many of my colleagues, have observed
that a large percentage of patients afflicted with oral cancer illicited histories
of excessive tobacco smoking, concomitant abuse of alcoholic beverages and diets
deficient in essential protein and vitamins. It is theoretically possible that the
dietary deficiency cowld condition the oral tissues or be a predisposing factor en-
abling the carcinogen present in the tobacco condensate to induce the development
of a cancerous process. The role of alcohol may be that of a synergistic direct
irritant, or indirectly by its action on the liver to effect degenerative changes
leading to cirrhosis; thus impairing an important immune center of the body.

Experimently, it is the purpose of this project to induce in laboratory animals
(white mice) cancer of the oral tissues by combining the factors, tobacco condensates,
alcohol, and dietary deficiencies.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 8

Six groups of white mice, each group to consist of ten mice will be subjected to
variations of tobacco application, alcohol and diet. A control group will be in-
cluded. The tobacco condensate will be diluted in 50% acetone and will be painted
on the oral mucosa four times weekly. The alcohol will be placed in the drinking
water of the animals and changed completely four times weekly. A 10% solution of
a standard brand of whiskey will be used. The diets, when deficient, will be re~
stricted in Vit. "A", "B" complex and "OC".

ANTMAL GROUPS:
Group I The oral mucosa will be painted on the same gite with the tobacco condensate.
Aleohol will be added to the water. The diet will be deficient in Vitamins
