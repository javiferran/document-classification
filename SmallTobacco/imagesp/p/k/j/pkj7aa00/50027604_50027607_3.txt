LABORATORY FACILITIES :

The project will be conducted at the Martland Medical Center, Newark, New
Jersey. Complete facilities for care and maintainence of animals are available
along with experienced personnel,

The animals will be observed daily as to development of lesions, especially

those related to neoplasia. Should tumors develop, charts will be designed to

show location of growth and the time required for its manifestation. Animals will
be sacrificed at varying intervals and histopathological sections will be prepared
for microscopic analysis.

The liver will be examined grossly and microscopically and all animals will

be autopsied.
