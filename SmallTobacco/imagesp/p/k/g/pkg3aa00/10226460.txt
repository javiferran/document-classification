DOES LUNG cancer actually occur more often in
smokers, or does it only seem to do so because it
is hunted with greater diagnostic vigour in such

persons?

Recent work by an inter.
nationally known epidemiolo-
nist suggests that “ detection

, bias" in a variety of studies
| may just possibly have pro-

duc: a “falsely high

‘ass... ution” between smok-

ing and lung cancer.
Dr Alvin R. Feinstein, Pro-

fessor of Medicine and Epi-

cemiology at Yale University,
suys that if his findings of
such “bias" in a study of
more than 1,300 lung cancer
patients are confirmed for the
seneral population of smok-
ers and nonsmokers, “we
may have to reappraise some
of the statistical reascning

“that has hitherto been used

to form causal conclusi«ns "
about smoking as a carcino
cen,

The findings were based on
a fetrospective restudy of
data on all patients (1,331)
with a diagnosis of primary
‘uag cancer at Yale-New
Haven Hospital and West
tlaven Veterans Administra-
re Hospital during 1953-

The first clue to the exist-
cnce of a possihly unrecog-
nsed bias came with a
“ necropsy surprise". Of 654
rattents examined post mor-
tim lung cancer had been
uns cted beforehand in
12, ue 16 per cent.
, Further study showed that

nondiagnosis during life”
was highest among those
matlents (37 per cent) whose

istory of cigarette smoking
was unknown.

“The rate of nordiagnosis,”
Dr. Feinstein said, “had a dis-
tinctive downward gradient,
going from 37 per cent unde-
tected among the non-cigar-
ette smokers to 20 per cent
among the light smokers; 14

rcentin the moderate; and
0 and 12 per cent in the
heavy and extreme smckers.

“There was a similar gra-
dient, but with Jarcer denomi-
hators, for the rate of non-
diagnosis in the entire case
sores, rather than in the nec-
ropsy group alonc.

“The cata therefore sug-
gested that the more paticnis
snwked, the more likely they
were to have lung cancer de-
tected during life.”

He and his colleague, Dr.’

Carolyn K. Wells, then exam-
ined the frequency and type
of diagnostic examinations
ordered for the entire case
series,

Chest x-rays were excluded
since every patient had had
one. Bronchoscopy was also
exchided since it was often
reserved for patients likely to
have operable lesions,

_ As an index test, the inves-
tigators chose the Papanico-
laou sputum smear, since it is
not based on operability, ere-
ates no discomfort, and can

 

be readily ordered.

Seventy-six per cent of the
total series of patients had re-
ceived a Pap sputum smear,
but here, too, there was a
steep gradient, with the smear
ordered for “53 per cent in
the unknown smoking group;
58 per cent in the non-
smokers; 63 per cent in the
light; 78 per cent in the heavy;
and 84 per cent in the extreme
group.” :

The team also found thet
the “ Pap smcar search rate
was substantially higher for
patients with a chronic or re-
cent cough (83 and 6&1 per
cent, respectively) than for
patients with no cough (59
per cent). But within each
category of cough the “search
rates went up in relation to
the amount of smoking.”

Among patients with no
cough the search rate rose
from 46 per cent in the no-
smoking troup to 59 per cent
among light or moderate smo-
kers and to 64 per cent in the

heavy or extreme smoking
group.

Among patients with chro-
nic cough there was an
“analgous gradient,” Dr. Fein-
stein reports, ranging from
53 to 81 to 85 per cent. In
patients with a recent cough,
the search rate went from 64
to 80 to 84 per cent in the
respective groups.

The Pap smear search rate,
he added, was lower in pa-
tients with disseminated can-
cer than in those with distant
metastases, “but in both
Clinical stayes, the gradient of
search increased with higher
amounts of smoking.”

In a Metical News inter-
view, Dr. Feinstein acknow-
ledged that he was question-
ing “one of the icons” of
modern statistics; but he
Stressed that the operative
word was “ * questioning,’ not
*atlacking’."" “The data we
have are suitable for rsising
questions, not for launching
an attack,” he said.
