D. Analysis of transcriptional activation with the purified transcription system
1. Examine the ability of factors such as Sp1 and GAL4 derivatives to activate transcription

with the purified, reconstituted transcription system. Consider possible requirements for
additional factors, such as TBP-associated factors (TAFs), additional basal factors (beyond
TFIIB, TBP, TFUF30, and polymerase), or chromatin-mediated repression of basal
transcription.

Specific Aims

I. In vitro transcription analysis with chromatin templates reconstituted from purified components.

1. Reconstitute chromatin templates with purified components and investigate the specific
functions of the following components:

a. core histone octamers (native and modified);

b. histone H1 (native H1, H1 variants, and modified forms of H1);

c. HMG proteins (HMG14/17 and HMG1/2 from calf thymus; HMG D from
Drosophila).

2. Examine the generality and mechanistic basis of transcriptional antirepression. Attempt to
reconstitute long-range (>1 kb) enhancer function in vitro with the chromatin templates.

II. Reconstitution and analysis of chromatin possessing physiological nucleosome spacing by using

a crude Drosophila embryo S-150 extract.

1. Determine conditions for reconstitution and purification of chromatin possessing evenly
distributed nucleosomes with a physiological repeat length by using a Drosophila embryo
S-150 extract.

2. Investigate the transcriptional properties of chromatin templates reconstituted with the
S-150.

3. Begin to fractionate and to purify components of the Drosophila embryo S-150 extract that
mediate chromatin reconstitution. Investigate, in particular, the determinants of nucleosomal
spacing.

III. Analysis of the chromatin structure of the Drosophila knirps gene both in vitro and in vivo.
Perform in vivo and in vitro footprint analyses of the knirps proximal promoter and
enhancer regions.

2. Reconstitute the Anirps transcriptional control region into chromatin, characterize the
chromatin, and attempt to identify factors involved in the establishment or dissolution of
nucleosome positioning.
