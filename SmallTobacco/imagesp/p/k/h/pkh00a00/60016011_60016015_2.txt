(ce). Specific Aims
A. Identification and characterization of factors that are required for basal transcription in addition to
TFIIB, TBP, TFIIF30, and polymerase
1. Examination of fractions from the HeLa transcription system.
2. Identification and characterization of factors from the Drosophila transcription system.
3. Investigation of the transcriptional requirement for negatively supercoiled DNA.
4. Study of the function of TFIIE. ;
B. Examination of the molecular basis for distinct transcriptional properties of different promoters
1. Perform in vitro transcription and gel shift analyses with a Systematic series of minimal
promoters and promoter hybrids to identify key cis-acting elements that are responsible for
differences in the mechanisms of basal transcription.
2. Investigate the protein factors that are responsible for the promoter-specific effects that have
been observed.
C. Kinetics and mechanism of transcription with a purified transcription system
1. - Determine the relative rates of assembly of the basal transcription factors into a functional
transcription complex.
2. Investigate the rates of assembly of the factors with different promoters as well as with
- wild-type and mutant variants of selected promoters.
3. Examine the kinetics of the transcription reaction with ‘wild-type and mutant variants of the
‘basal transcription factors, such as TFIIB and TBP.
