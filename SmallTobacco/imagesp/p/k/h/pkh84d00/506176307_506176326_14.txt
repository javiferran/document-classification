conducted. The statistical evaluation of incidence data was made
by contingency table techniques, comparing each treated group
with the control group. For each such comparison, a 2 x 2 table
(fourfold table) was formed from the numbers of animals with and
without the event of interest in both the control and treated
groups. Each table was evaluated by performing a chi-square test
with continuity correction provided that the smallest expected
value in the table was 5 or more. Otherwise, the table was
evaluated by Fisher’s "exact" test. These computations were
performed by BMD program PIF. The two-tailed probability was
calculated by doubling the one-tailed result. This is in
agreement with Armitage’s recommendation.
