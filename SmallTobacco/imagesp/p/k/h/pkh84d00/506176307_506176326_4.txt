level was performed. All statistical tests were conducted ata
5% two-sided risk level.

Statistical analysis of treatment-related lesions, including
incidence of lesions and pathological findings were also
conducted. The statistical evaluation of incidence data was made
by contingency table techniques, comparing each treated group
with the control group. For each such comparison, a 2 x 2 table
(fourfold table) was formed from the numbers of animals with and
without the event of interest in both the control and treated
groups. Each table was evaluated by performing a chi-square test
with continuity. correction provided that the smallest expected
value in the table was 20 or more. Otherwise, the table was
evaluated by Fisher’s "exact" test. These computations were
performed by BMD program PIF. The two-tailed probability was
calculated by doubling the one-tailed result. This is in
agreement with Armitage’s recommendation.
