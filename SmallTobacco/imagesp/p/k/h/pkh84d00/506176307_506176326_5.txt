6.4.3.4.3 Results of 14-day Glycerol Inhalation Study in
Rats Conducted at a Contract Laboratory

6.4.3.4.3.1 Executive Summary

The objective of this study was to investigate biological
effects, if any, of repeated nose-only inhalation exposures to
glycerol in the rat. Ten Sprague-Dawley derived rats/sex/group
received nose-only exposures 6 hours/day, 5 days/week (Monday
through Friday) for 10 consecutive workdays to aerosol
concentrations of 1.01 (SD = 0.08), 2.01 (SD = 0.33), or 4.05 (SD
= 0.33) mg/L of glycerol. An identical group served as
sham-exposed controls. The 4.05 mg/L concentration was the
highest achievable concentration of respirable aerosol. Animals
were observed for signs of toxicity twice daily, were weighed at
2 to 3 day intervals, and diet consumption was recorded at weekly
intervals. Following the exposure period, the animals were
killed and a complete gross examination of tissues/organs was
performed. Selected organs were weighed and examined
histopathologically, In addition, blood was collected and
analyzed for specific hematological and clinical chemist
parameters. Examination of the results of this study indicated
that 6-hour nose-only inhalation exposures for 10 consecutive
workdays to the maximum respirable concentration of glycerol
(4.05 +/~- 0.33 mg/L) had no effect of biological significance on
any of the parameters evaluated.

6.4.3.4.3.2 Test Article Exposure
6.4.3.4.3.2.1 Chemical Analysis of Glycerol

The test article, glycerol, was supplied by Procter and Gamble as
"Superol Glycerine, USP." Quality Code 911-716. An analytical
report supplied by Procter and Gamble indicated a purity of
99.3%. The identity of the test article was confirmed by
infrared (IR) spectrometry conducted at the testing laboratory.
In addition, samples of the glycerol were analyzed by Huffman
Laboratories (Wheat Ridge, CO) for water content. Water content
was determined to by 0.12%.

Samples were also analyzed from the reservoir from which glycerol
was drawn by the liquid nebulizer. Samples taken prior to and
after 6 hour aerosol generation periods contained 0.35% and 0.81%
water; respectively. Gas chromatographic analysis of reservoir
samples taken before a six hour aerosol generation run contained
98.2 +/- 2.3% glycerol and samples analyzed by the same procedure
but taken from the nebulizer reservoir after 6 hours of
generation contained 98.4 +/- 6.6% glycerol.

A third stage of glycerol analysis was conducted on Gelman-type
A/E 25mm glass fiber filters upon which glycerol aerosol samples
