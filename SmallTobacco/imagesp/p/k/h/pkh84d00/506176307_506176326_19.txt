6.4.3.4.5.5 Hematology and Clinical Chemistry

There were no statistically significant differences in hematology
parameters between the exposed rats in any group of either sex
when compared to their respective control group.

The only statistically significant (P < 0.05) treatment-related
difference in serum chemistry parameters in the exposed and
control groups was increased triglyceride values in the low and
middle exposure group males. The differences in the triglyceride
values, in the opinion of the contract laboratory clinical
pathologist, were of no biological significance.

6.4.3.4.5.6 Discussion

Subchronic nose-only inhalation exposures of rats to glycerol
aerosol concentrations ranging from 0.033 to 0.660 mg/L under the
described experimental conditions had no biologically significant
effects on any of the parameters investigated. These parameters
included signs of toxicity and morbidity; body weights; diet
consumption; mortality; gross observations at necropsy;
histopathologic observations; hematolo and serum chemistry;

terminal body weights; certain organ weights; organ:body weight
ratios; and organ:brain weight ratios.
