Table 1 lists the mean and standard deviation for the average nicotine delivery
by the Barclay brand.

It is interestina that the major factor contributing to high plasma vaiues for
cotinine is the number of cigarettes smoked per day. The cotinine plasma values
varied from a low of 13 mg/ml to a high of 505 mg/ml. While as expected the
average plasma value with the Barclay brand was higher than that observed with the
0.1 mg nicotine ultra-low brands, the distribution of cotinine plasma values was
not significantly different.

These data support the contention that the Barclay brand cigarettes delivers

nicotine consistent with the delivery of other ultra-low delivery brands.
