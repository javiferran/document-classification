These evaluations of cotinine plasma values from a study of thirty-nine
smokers of ultra-low nicotine and tar cigarettes conducted by Franklin Institute
provide further assurance that the Barclay brand is an ultra-low delivery cigarette.
Several methods have been used to date that provide for classification of different
brands according to the nicotine and tar content delivered to the smoker. The FTC
method is the standard procedure for establishing nicotine and tar delivery for
each cigarette smoked,

The use of cotinine plasma level determinations obtained from smokers under
established smoking conditions allows for comparison between predicted values for
plasma cotinine and observed values. Using the kinetic equations described in
Part I and the sequential solution computer model, it is possible to arrive at a
predicted plasma Jevel for cotinine based upon cigarette consumption utilizing
labeled value for nicotine delivery. With establishment of the mathematical
relationship between observed and predicted continine values, it is possible to
estimate the average delivery for each cigarette smoked. Figures 7 through 4

provide a histogram of the average delivery for the brands studies. Figures 5

265920T0S

and 6 illustrate the variation in number of cigarettes smoked per day for the

 

different brands studied. The diary values were used to construct these histograms.

 

Since smoking patterns varied within days for each smoker, it is possible that

these values may not reflect exact values for use with the computer model.
