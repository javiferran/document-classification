WASHINGTON, May 15—Carmine
DeSapio, boss of Tammany Hall a gen-
eration ago, abolished the smoke-
filled room uring his tenure as leader
because his eyes were sensitive to
smoke.

Im that sense at jeast. Mr. DeSapio
ds regarded as a prophet without honor
in his own time by members of a
mew organization. one fiercer and
rrore self-righteous than the old Tiger
of Tammany: the Group Against Smok-
ers’ Pollution (GASP).

Across the nation, GASP chapters
have been formed to help shame the
52 million American smokers into re-
fraining from indulging their habit in
the “breathing space” of nonsmokers.

“Nonsmokers have rights tco” is
the slogan of GASP and in its “libera-
tion guide” there are tips to members
about methods to discomfit those whe
discomfort them. Some ideas are
forthright—"Speak out against smok-
ing!*"—while others are maddening,
such as “Discourage smoking by not
providing ashtrays.”

So far, so good: In an enclosed
space, people who are annoyed by
tobacco smoke should make known
their irritation to smokers, who should
then have the courtesy to desist. Un-
fortunately. that is not the last GASP:
Buoyed by their success in getting air-
Hines to segregate smokers, the non-
smokers are pressing their attack with
demands for government regulatior. of
“breathing space.”

From Barry Goldwater's Arizona to
George McGovern’s South Dakota.
states have passed laws prohibiting
smoking in museums. concert halls,
theaters, libranes and elevators. This
morning. New York City’s Board of
Health is scheazied to act on a pro-

posal to compel the segregation of
smokers from nonsmokers in most
public places, including restaurants.

This is a good example of the tyr-
anny of the minority. A little group
of willful persons, representing no
opinion but thtir own, has rendered
the great smoking public helpless and
contemptible.

“Where a fire or health hazard exists,
nobody disputes that smoking should

 

de prohibited. But despite the fuming”

of former Surgeon General Jesse
Steinfeld, no evidence exists to sug-
gest that the exhaled smoke of other
persons poses a health hazard to non-
smokers. A tiny minority is acutely
allergic to smoke, and its wishes need
to be considered, but public policy
ought not to be set to accommodate
today’s Carmine DeSapios.

The cigarette smoker is already the
target of too many Government agen-
cies. He cannot be advertised to on
television; he must carry around on
every pack a dire warning about kill-
ing himself; he is taxed regressively
and punitively.

Yet the smoker continues to smoke;
in the United States last year, 588
billion cigarettes were puffed, dragged
upon and choked over, and thanks to
the growing interest in smoking by
teen-age girls, the market continues
te grow,

This perverseness—the refusal of
people to do what is gond for them —
activates the antismoking brigade, |
think, even more than the annovance
caused by the exhalation of the coffin-
nailers. If smokers do not respond to
reason. to wamings, to the silencing
of advertising, to tax disincentives,
then perhaps the only way is to make
it more difficult to find a place to
Nght up.

“You are not denying the smoker's
right to smoke,” GASP assures its
members, “only his/her right to smoke
in your breathing space.” Not true;
any harassment, especially harassment
by executive regulations, is part of «
process that infringes our liberties and
poliutes our statute books.

Today the smoker, tomorrow the

onion-eater, and the day after tomor-
Tow the person who prefers cheap
perfume to the taking of baths: once
Government gets its nose under the
tent of social intercourse, there will
be no privacy for anyone,

The bossism of the do-gooder is
intolerable, even when he/she (fight
linguistic pollution) clooks paternal-
ism in the guise of selfishness. Not
every social inequity needs a legal
cure: social, not government, pressure
is appropriate to curb the smoker. A
giare, a sniff, and if necessary the
green-gilled appearance of the onset
of motion sickness, should be enough
to get a smoker to stub out his butt
in a hurry.

T gave up smoking two years ago
and it is like Josing a friend, I don’t
feel any better, and am not inclined
to badger others into sacrificing one
of life’s little pleasures. What incenses
some people is incense to me; blow
some my way.

But the abuse of the power of
health agencies to put a governmental
fist into the glove of social courtesies
is worrisome. A new law separating
smoking from nonsmoking areas in
restaurants would invite a smoker's
Sit-in at a nonsmoking lunch counter,
turning the civil-rights clock back by
decades.

in their zeal, the people from GASP
have gone too far. we can now look
forward to the formation of “People
United to Fight for Freedom by Figh:-
ing Fire With Fire” (PUFFF).
