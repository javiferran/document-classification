Samples needed: 24 hr. of urine output(12:00 AM to 11:59 PM)
the urine must be refrigerated upon voiding

10 mi of peripheral blood obtained by
venipuncture

SAMPLE PROCESSING

Urine: The urine will be concentrated using XAD-2 resin. Mutagenicity of a DMSO

extract will be assessed in the microsuspension modification of the Ames
bacterial mutation assay.

Blood: Blood will be placed in culture medium which contains the mitogen
phytohemagglutinin and the nucleotide bromodeoxyuridine.. Cultures are
incubated at 37 degrees € in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Chromosome
aberrations will be assessed after 45 to 54 hours and sister chromatid
exchanges after 64 to 7B hours of culture. Colcemid(2 x 10-7 M) will be added

2 to 3 hours prior to harvesting the cells for chromosome analysis to arrest
the cells in metaphase.
