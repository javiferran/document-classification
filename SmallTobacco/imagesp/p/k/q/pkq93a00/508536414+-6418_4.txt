b. Each cigarette is allowed to burn its entire length unless an
obvious ignition occurs; otherwise, the test is considered valida
when either (1) a cigarette has burned its entire length on each
of the three individual test specimens or (2) three cigarettes have
self-extinguished on the sanplg@ A self-extinguished cigarette
shall be replaced with a freshlyhignted cigarette and covered with

extinguish the smoldering materials, record the results of the test.

the vertical panel upward from the original crevice to the nearest
2 mm (0.1 in).

VIII. TEST CRITERIA
After removal of the sheeting cigarette cover cloth, leave the assembly
intact while making char measurements.
1. If all test specimens have no ignition, or if no individual
specimen yields a vertical char of 44 mm (1.75 in) or greater, the
fabric is a UFAC Class I cover fabric.
2. If the vertical char of any of the three test specimens is equal to
or greater than 44 mm (1.75 in » the fabric is a UFAC Class IT cover
fabric.
3. If an obvious ignition of the polyurethane substrate occurs on one
of more test assemblies, the fabric is a UFAC Class II cover fabric.
