c. The horizontal panel specimens shall be cut such that the major
areas of weave variation will lie on the crevice when specimens are
mounted warp to warp with vertical panel specimens.
d. For dyed and/or printed fabrics, color shall not constitute a
difference with respect to cigarette ignition resistance in this
test.

3. SPECIMEN MOUNTING:
a. For vertical panels, place the cover fabric specimen on a 203 x
203 x 51 mm (8.0 x 8.0 x 2.0 in) polyurethane substrate as shown in
Figure III, taking care that any areas of weave mentioned in SAMPLE
REQUIREMENTS above are on the edge which will form the crevice of
the assembled test apparatus. The warp or machine direction of the
fabric should run front to back on the test assembly. Attach the
cover fabric to the substrate with straight pins.
b. For horizontal panels, place the cover fabric specimen on a 127
x 203 x 51 mm (5.0 x 8.0 x 2.0 in) polyurethane substrate as shown
in Figure III, taking care that any areas of weave mentioned in
SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS above are on the edge which will form the
crevice of the assembled test apparatus. The warp or machine
direction of the fabric should run front to back on the test
assembly. Attach the cover fabric to the substrate with straight
pins.
c. Place the assembled vertical and horizontal panels in the
specimen holders such that a snug fit without deformation as shown
in Figure III is obtained.

VII. TEST PROCEDURE
1. TESTING PRECAUTIONS: THE GASEOUS PRODUCTS OF SMOLDERING COMBUSTION
ARE TOXIC. LARGE AMOUNTS OF CARBON MONOXIDE AND OTHER NOXIOUS GASES
ARE PRODUCED BY SMOLDERING ORGANIC MATTER. TESTS SHOULD BE CONDUCTED
IN A FUME HOOD OR ROOM PROVIDED WITH ADEQUATE MEANS FOR REMOVAL OF
TOXIC FUMES.
2. CONDITIONING: All test specimens, cover fabrics and test materials
{including polyurethane, cigarettes and sheeting material) shall be
conditioned at a temperature of 21° + 39 c (70° + 4° F) and between
50% and 66% relative humidity for at least four hours prior to
testing. If the test room conditions do not meet the specifications
above for the conditioning room, then testing must be initiated within
ten minutes after the specimens are removed from the conditioning
roon.
3. AIR VELOCITY: Zero air flow at the test surface is desirable,
indicated by a minimum vertical smoke plume of 152 mm (6.0 in). A
draft-preventive enclosure to restrict air flow to convection only is
required. See Figure II.
4. CONDUCTING THE TEST:
a. Each loaded specimen holder shall be placed on a table in the
draft-preventive enclosure. Light three cigarettes and place one
cigarette on each of the three test assemblies such that the
cigarette lies in the crevice and against the vertical panel,
equally spaced from each side. Immediately cover the cigarette
with a piece of sheeting material, smoothing it over the cigarette
to insure intimate contact. A finger run over the covered
cigarette insures good fabric-to-cigarette contact. Pin top edge
of sheeting to the vertical panel approximately 50 mm (2.0 in)
above the cigarette.
