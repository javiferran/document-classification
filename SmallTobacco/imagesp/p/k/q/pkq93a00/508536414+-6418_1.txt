oz). Pall Mall non-filtered cigarettes ordinarily will meet these
specifications.
2. SHEETING MATERIAL: 100% cotton bedsheeting material, weight 125 +
28 g/m? (3.7 + 0.8 o2z/yd7), white in color, and not treated with flame

which meets the requirements of the UFAC Filling/Padding Component
Test Method--1990, containing no inorganic fillers or flame
retardants, having a density of 24.0 + 1.6 kg/m3 (1.5 + O.1 lb/ft3):
UFAC Standard Polyurethane Foam. This material can be obtained from
several commercial sources.
a. Substrate shall be cut into pieces 203 x 203 x 51 mn (8.0 x
x 2.0 in) for vertical panels and 127 x 203 x 51 mm (5.0 x 8.
2.0 in) for horizontal panels.
b. Each panel shall be hand crushed before use by wadding or
balling up one time in the fist.
4. TEST ROOM: The test room shall be draft protected and equipped
with a suitable system for exhausting smoke and noxious gases produced
during testing.

thickness, joined together at one edge. As shown in Figure I, a
moveable horizontal panel support is positioned on a centrally
located guide.

2. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS:
a. From the upholstery cover fabric sample to be classified, three
specimens shall be cut for vertical panels each 203 x 381 mm (8.0 x
15.0 in) and three specimens for horizontal panels each 203 x 254
mn (8.0 x 10.0 in).
b. The vertical panel specimens shall be cut with the long
