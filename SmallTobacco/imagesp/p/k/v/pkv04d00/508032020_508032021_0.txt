allow for differing nicotine contents of the cigarettes. “We
found that the amounts of nicotine produced from the NC and
the RC under human smoking conditions, however, were roughly
proportional to the amounts produced under "standard"
conditions. Our studies show that smokers smoke the NC
differently than the RC, since they take more puffs closer
together in time. The cigarettes are different from one
another in many respects, however, other than nicotine
yields. There is no evidence for compensation, as judged by
the amount of nicotine absorbed relative to the yield of

nicotine.

22. Did you at any time notice smokers compensating their
smoking patterns when smoking the NC?

How one responds to a question on compensation depends
on its definition. If one defines "compensation" as the
smokers attempt to achieve a particular plasma nicotine
level concordant with his/her accustomed plasma nicotine
level when smoking his/her regular brand, when compared to
PREMIER, then we can say there is no compensation. The
smoker’s level of plasma nicotine level when smoking PREMIER
never approaches those plasma nicotine levels observed when

smoking the reference cigarettes. If one defines

 

compensation as an increase in the puff volume, we can say |

that there is no compensation. The data show that there was
