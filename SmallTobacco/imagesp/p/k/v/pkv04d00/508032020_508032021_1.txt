no increase in puff volume in smokers of PREMIER, when
compared to the reference cigarette. If one defines
compensation as an increase in the number of cigarettes
smoked, we can say that there is no compensation. The data
show that there was no increase in the number of PREMIERs
smoked, when compared to the reference cigarettes, even
after ad libitum smoking. If one defines compensation as an
increase in the total volume of smoke puffed by the smoker,
we can say that ther is compensation. Smokers of PREMIER

took more frequent puffs, particularly at the beginning and

end of the smoking cycle. We would attribute this mannerism

as a characteristic of smoking PREMIER in that the lighting
process requires a longer period of time. Similarly, since
PREMIER does not burn down, the smoker takes an increased

number of puffs before he/she is satisfied that the carbon

heat source has been expended.

23. What were the nicotine amounts produced by the NC and
the RC used in the human studies?
The NC nicotine value was 0.34 mg/cigarette. The RC

value for nicotine was 0.66 mg/cigarette.

24. Is Reynolds planning on marketing its NC with similar
nicotine values vis a vis a the RC used in the study?
No. PREMIER currently on the market has nicotine

levels comparable to those tested in our program.
