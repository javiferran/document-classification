NEW YORK — The world’s biggest ciga-
rette company’s acknowledgment that
i gerous and addictive is spur-
ring renewed calls for federal regulation of
tobacco and grealer efforts to keep chil-
dren from taking their first puff.
Philip Morris Cos. {nc., which owns the
Hpeaccanrompaty that makes best-selling
‘ariboro and other cigarettes, publicly ac-
knowledged with the debut of its corporate
Internet site Wednesday that smokers face
serious health risks.

The declarations by Philip Morris follow
years in which it fiercely argued with gav-
ernment and medical authorities about the
risks of smoking.

President Clinton said Philip Morris’ ac-
knowledgment that tobacco Isn't safe
“comes far too iate but still we must all wel-
come it, It can be the beginning of clearing
the air.”

“Tt certainly makes clear, as I have said
for years, that the lobacco companics
should answer for their actions in court,”
the president said Wednesday. "They

should stop marketing their prod-
ucts to children. And certainly they
should do much more to reduce

The Justice Department flied
‘ it against the tobacco companies
last month seeking to recover bil-
lions of doliars in federal health
costs for treating sick smokers.
\ The states already nave settled
with the industry for $248 billion
-over 25 years. .

ermment have sued the tobacco
makers for compensation for the
health consequences of smoking.
“In some ways I recognize this is
a public relations effort,” said Da-
vid Kessler, the former head of the
‘“tsfederat Food and Drug Adminis-
+Ltration, said in an interview. “But it
*-certainly sels the stage for regu-
lation of tobacco products.”
