Principal investigators in the trans-.

Charles W. Hewitt, co-directors of
UC!’s Reconstructive Microsurgery
and Transplantation Laboratory. The
research team also included Dr.
David Furnas, chief of plastic sur-~,

surgeon and director of the burn unit
at UCI Medical Center.

 

 
 
  

 

 

   

Findings of the study, funded by ~~
the National Institutes of Health,
were published recently in the
journal, Transplantation.

Black, a bio-engineer, said the”
findings are encouraging.

“This research could spark a revol-
ution in transplant surgery,” he said.
“For the first time, we have shown
that tissues of this kind can be
transplanted for long terms of
survival in animals,” oo.

But he added, “The bottom line is
that there’s still a lot of work to do
before we can apply this clinically in
people.” :

He said the transplant research at
UCI has taken place over the past six
years.

“Most of the success has been
attributed to cyclosporine, _ Blac!
said, referring to as anti-rejection
drug discovered in the mid-1970s.

 

Cyclosporine allows the body to
protect itself against infection, but
suppresses rt of the immune
system invoived in the rejection of
transplanted tissue. In humans, the
drug has been used to help prevent
rejection in kidney, bone marrow,
heart-lung, pancreas and liver trans-

plants.

Black said the UCI experiments
determined that the drug could also
help in composite tissue transplants.
The tests also focused on how much
cyclosporine was needed and what

Finally, the researchers found that the
transplanted tissues could survive for
the duration of the animal’s life.

The transplanted rat legs showed
signs of near-normal .muscle and
nerve activity. But the limbs did not

not walk normally on the tranplanted.
legs —- because of the complexity of
reconnecting the nerves and muscles
required for such movement.

The rats used in the UCI tests
normally have a three-year life span.
Black said some of the rats that
underwent leg transplants lived as
long as 700 days after the surgery.

He said researchers were able to

accomplish the transplants with rela-
tively low dosages of cyclosporine, an
important finding because the drug
can be toxic at high levels, The finding
that the transplant limbs survived
after discontinuing cyclosporine was
unexpected, and the UCI scientist
said additional studies are planned.
While functional human limb
transplants are years away, Black said
the UCI experiments may have more
immediate implications in the re-
placement of large areas of skin,
muscle, blood vessels and bone
damages by burns, gunshot wounds
or other injuries. He said such tissue
grafts could eventually replace the
prosthetic devices used today.
