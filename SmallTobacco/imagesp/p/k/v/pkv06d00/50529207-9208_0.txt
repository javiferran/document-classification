PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

1965-68. Graduate research (Master's) at the University of Osaka, Osaka, Japan.
Advisor: Dr. A. Tsugita. Elucidation of the amino acid sequence of wild type and double-frameshift mutant
lysozyme from T4 phage. This work confirmed for the first time the genetic code via in vivo experiments.

1968-72. Graduate research (Ph.D.) at M.LT., Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Advisor: Dr. C. Baglioni. Majors areas of research: a) Mechanisms of protein synthesis using cell-free
systems; b) Characterization of globin and histone mRNAs; c) Demonstration and characterization of maternal
messenger RNAs in unfertilized sea urchin eggs.

1972-77. Postdoctoral research at the University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland,
Advisor: Dr. M. Crippa. Developed a method for the mass fractionation of Drasaphila egg chambers.
Initiated experiments on gene expression durin g Drosophila oogenesis.

1977-83. Assistant Professor, Department of Developmental Genetics & Anatomy, Casc Western Reserve
University, Cleveland, Ohio.

1983-93. Associate Professor, Department of Genetics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.

1993-present. Professor, Department of Genetics, Case Westem Reserve U niversity, Cleveland, Ohio.
