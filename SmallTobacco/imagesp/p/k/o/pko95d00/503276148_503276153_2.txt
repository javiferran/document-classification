B. Automated Methods. (Personnel: Diffee)

During the past quarter, the Technicon Menthol Procedure was thoroughly
investigated to develop an alternate procedure for the Robot Chemist Method.
Factors studied included H2S0, concentration, DMAB reagent concentration,
reaction temperature, reaction time, and sampling rate.

Mixing problems exist In the flow system because of the high viscosity

of the H2S0, solution (60% was the lowest H2S0, concentration that could be
used). This results in a low sampling rate for the Technicon System (20 samples/hr

vs. 60/hr. for the Robot Chemist).

A collaborative study was run between the Robot Chemist and the Technicon
AutoAnalyzer using factory samples for a one-week period. The same standards
were used to calibrate both instruments, and all samples were taken from the
same distillations. Al! calculations were done by computer from best curve
fit. The AutoAnalyzer gave higher results over the study. Reasons for this

difference are not apparent.

An alternate procedure involving gas chromatography as the end determination
is currently under investigation.
