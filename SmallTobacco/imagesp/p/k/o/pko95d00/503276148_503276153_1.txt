Methoprene analyses of samples taken during spray application have
been run by Stoner Labs in Santa Clara, California, and Mr. Harold Gilleland
of the Research Department. The analysis of 13 stem samples run by Stoner
Labs ranged from 5.0 ppm-16.4 ppm with an average of 7.5 ppm. Six stem
sample analyses run by Mr. Gilleland ranged from 4.4 ppm-8.5 ppm with an
average of 6.1 ppm. -Results received to date on leaf sample analyses are
listed below.

Core samples have been taken from the Tersa bales for each of the four
grades. Results on these have not yet been received.

The spraying equipment has been sent back to Zoecon Corporation for

modification. It will then be shipped to Ecuador where it will be used to
treat the 1980 crop. Tentative date for startup in Ecuador is October 1|5,
1980. Representatives from Zoecon Corporation and RJR will be on site in
Ecuador at the start of the processing season. Samples of Kabat R treated
tobacco will be taken for Methoprene analysis.

Dr. Stuart Bellin, who will retire officially on October I, 1980, left
on vacation September 10, 1980 and will not return to work. Mr. Johnny Brooks

joined the Research Department on September 4, 1980 and is being trained in
all aspects of the Cigarette Beetle Control Program.

l}s METHODS DEVELOPMENT. Project 7124

A Smoke Generation Study. (Personnel: Conner)

This study is examining the affects of lab conditions and smoking
machine type on analytical results. The initial phase of the study has
used the monitor cigarette and looked at FTC tar and nicotine values.
Generation of data for this phase of the project is complete. Data are
being processed and compared. The puff profile of each machine studied
was also examined.

The next phase of the project will investigate solution trapping methods.

Mr. Art Milhous is on loan from this project to one involving a study â€”
of the Technicon Infrared Reflectance Analyzer.
