The monitoring program is on schedule and proceeding well. A semi-annual
report of the monitoring data was prepared for the Engineering Department. -
Considerable time has been consumed doing repetitive samples from sites out
of compliance with NPDES permit limits. Many of these prob!ems have been or

will be rectified shortly. Routine samples are being received from the
cigarette manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico for analysis. This information
will be used to bring their discharges into compliance.

A study was done on the biodegradation of a synthetic cutting oi1 to
determine (1) biodegradability as claimed by the manufacturer and (2) could
the material be disposed of in the sanitary sewer. The substance was bio- |
degradable but would require 1000-5000 fold dilution for disposal in the
sanitary sewer in order to comply with the Sewer Use Ordinance. Direct
disposal Into the anaerobic digestor at Elledge WIP is being examined.
