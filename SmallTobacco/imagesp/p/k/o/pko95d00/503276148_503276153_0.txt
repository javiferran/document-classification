|. CIGARETTE BEETLE CONTROL. Project 7131 (Personnel: Bellin, Hutchens,
Brooks)

Due to a mild winter and an unusually long hot summer, cigarette beetle
counts for the season have been excessively high. A total of 4,475,800
beetles has been trapped to date. This is the largest number of insects
trapped since the summer of 1976, a season which required a large number
of fumigations following a mild winter. Forty-four shed fumigations have
been completed this quarter. Twenty-two of these have been at Davie County
storage. This is 85% of the Davie sheds which contain tobacco. Rapid
buildup of insect populations has necessitated fumigating in two locations
at the same time. This is the first time in the history of the insect
control program that this has been necessary.

The insecticidal fogging schedule at Davie has been increased to six
nights each week. All other locations are being fogged every other night
(three times each week).

A sample of each DDVP mix has been analyzed by Mr. David Heavner.
Concentrations of DDVP in the mixes ranged from 9.5%-13.3%. The correct
concentration is 9.3%. The meter-which measures kerosene was found to be
in error and has been replaced with a new one. Analysis of the latest mix,
using the new meter has not been completed.

Counts from factory traps are up to date. The increased number of
beetles in the traps from the receiving areas indicates that insects are
betng brought into the factories from the high infestations in the sheds.
This could lead to higher customer complaints due to insects.

Application of Kabat R +o tobacco at the Brook Cove stemmery has been
completed. A total of 93.5 gallons of Kabat R was used to treat 3,318,192
pounds of stems (9.24 ppm) and 95.5 gallons used to treat 3,232,223 pounds
of strips (9.69 ppm). The calculated rate of application was 10 ppm. The
cost of the chemical to treat this tobacco was $22,680.

The stems are stored in cardboard boxes and the leaf in poly-wrapped
Tersa bales. The tobacco is stored in Shed 435 at Brook Cove. The shed is
not being fogged nor will it be fumigated. Insect counts will be monitored

â€œclosely and temperature and humidity measurements taken weekly during the
test period. The insect count in the shed to date is 4,263.
