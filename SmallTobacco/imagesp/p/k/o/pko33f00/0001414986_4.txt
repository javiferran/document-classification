The presence of glutamine in protein (casein) was postulated by
Hlasiwetz and Habermann (1873) ten years prior to its isolation by
Schulze and Bosshard (1883). Glutamine is found in plants
(including tobacco), fungi, bacteria and animals in both the free
form and in peptide form. It occurs in relatively low
concentrations in most animal and plant proteins (4-10% of total

amino acids)(Kominz, et al., 1954).

Chemically, free glutamine is unique as an amide in that the amide
group is much more labile than other common amides, and serves as
a reservoir of nitrogen (as ammonia). Glutamine, when heated in
weak acid, neutral or alkaline solution, is converted to
5-oxoproline or its salt much more rapidly than is glutamic acid.

At pH 6.5, 99 percent of the glutamine is converted to

5-oxoproline in 1.5 hours at 100Â°C (Archibald, 1945). -
