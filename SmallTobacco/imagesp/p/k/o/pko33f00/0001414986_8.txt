are normal constituents in our everyday diet (Orr and Watt, 1957).
In general dietary intake of qg-amino acids from flavor use is very

low compared to intake from a normal diet (FEMA, 1983).

In the excellent review article entitled â€œEffects of Ingestion of
Disproportionate Amounts of Amino Acids, Harper et al., (1970)
concluded (p. 507) that:

"Prom the accumulated observations on animals, it seems

on a diet composed of natural foods. Quantities of individual
amino acids sufficient to result in adverse effects would not be
used as supplements to foodstuffs. It would require 10=fold the

normal supplementary level or more to approach the amounts shown

to cause adverse effects in animals. Only if large doses of
