Mutagenicity: Gluatmine was tested for mutagenicity in
Escherichia coli K-12 uvrB, a model for the production of
"spontaneous “ mutations induced by DNA damage produced during
normal metabolism. At 2 ™M, glutamine produced no mutagenesis in
the uvrB or wild-type uvrB umuCc strain (Sargentini and Smith,

1986).

Carcinogenicity: There have been no carcinogenicity studies

reported for glutamine.

Teratogenicity: Smith et al. (1965) reported that L-glutamine was
not embryotoxic in the rabbit. Ina study in which single amino
acids were fed to rats during the 14-20th days of gestation, the
authors report that glutamine was embryotoxic only during the
second half of pregnancy (Mankowska et al., 1980). L-Glutamine
was tested in an in vitro assay that identifies teratogens by
their ability to inhibit growth of an established line of human
embryonic palatal mesenchymal cells, and was found to produce no

inhibition up to 1.0 mM. (Pratt and Willis, 1985). .

Certain chromosomal disorders in mammalian embryos are traceable
to meiotic errors during oocyte maturation, the developmental
process which reduces genetic content from diploid to haploid, and
which is required before normal fertilization can occur. The

first meiotic division occurs during maturation and is suscepible

to errors which can be responsible for a rather high incidence of
