Abstract:

L-Glutamine has been characterized as a nonessential or
nutritionally dispensable amino acid but recent studies suggest
that it may be a conditionally essential nutrient, particularly in
catabolic disease states. As a flavorant, L-glutamine has
essentially no taste or odor and its main contribution is probably
in the production of "secondary flavorings" which make their
appearance in the course of oxidative or enzymatic action. These
so-called Maillard-type products are produced when glutamine
reacts with reducing sugars to produce substances with both
characteristic taste and flavor. L-Glutamine is listed asâ€™ GRAS by

FEMA (#3684) and is approved for food use by FDA.

Few acute or chronic toxicity studies for L-glutamine have been

reported. For the mouse, an oral LDeg of 21.7 g/kg was reported

and for the rat, a LDe 9 7.5 g/kg orally was reported.
