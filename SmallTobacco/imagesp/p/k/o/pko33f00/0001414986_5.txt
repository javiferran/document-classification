Biological Significance:

Glutamine has been categorized as a nonessential or nutritionally
dispensible amino acid (Rose, 1938; Meister, 1980). This
classification implies that glutamine can be synthesized
endogenously in adequate quantities from other amino acids and
precursors, but this view belies glutamine's gualitative and
quantitative importance in metabolic pathways. In addition to its
role as a structural unit in proteins, glutamine is an amino acid

with a number of unique physiologic and biochemical properties.

In plasma, it is the most abundant amino acid (600-900uM) where it
accounts for approximately 20 percent of the total circulating
free amino acid pool (Harris et al., 1943). There is a marked
concentration gradient across the plasma membrane of many tissues
such that glutamine is an even more important component of
intracellular amino acid pools. Free glutamine concentration in
human skeletal muscle is in the range of 20 mâ„¢ and glutamine
accounts for more than 60 percent of the entire free amino acid
pool (Bergstrom et al., 1974). Muscle contains about half of the
total free amino acids in the body, so it is apparent that
glutamine is an unusually important amino acid quantitatively.
Changes in tissue glutamine concentrations have been shown to
correlate with net protein turnover, and there is evidence that

glutamine may both stimulate protein synthesis and inhibit protein
