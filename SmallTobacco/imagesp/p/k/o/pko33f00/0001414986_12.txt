Pyrolysis Studies:

The presence of glutamine in foods either from natural sources or
flavor usage probably results in a very low order of toxicity.
However, under varying conditions of temperature, time, etc., food
amino acids and proteins undergo a series of complicated reactions
with carbohydrates to yield so called “browning products". The
nutritional value, chemistry, toxicity and metabolism of these
browned product mixtures (Maillard reaction products) have been
reviewed recently. (Waller et al.,1983; Tovar et al., 1983). The
chemistry (Ciusa et al., 1975) and mutagenicity (Shinohara et al.,
1983) of some glutamine specific Maillard products have been

reported.

L-Glutamine was included among 25 amino acids subjected to sealed
tube pyrolysis at 600°C for 1 minute and the products assayed for
mutagenic activity. The pyrolysis products were not identified.
The mutagenic activity was assayed against S. typhimurium strain
TA98 in the presence of liver microsomal fraction S9. The
pyrolyzate of L-glutamine showed mutagenic activity but the number
of revertants per pyrolyzate of 1 M amino acid was less than for

other amino acids such as glutamic acid, arginine, lysine,

ornithine, valine and tryptophan (Matsumoto et al., 1977).
