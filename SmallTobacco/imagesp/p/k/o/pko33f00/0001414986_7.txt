Use as a Flavorant

Glutamine has been described as having practically no odor or
taste (Seidman, 1979), a flat taste (Arai et al., 1973), a
slightly sweet taste (Food Chemicals Codex, 1981) and a sweet,
meaty taste (Schiffman, et al., 1975). As a flavorant,
glutamine's main contribution is probably in the production of
â€œsecondary flavorings" which make theix appearance in the course
of oxidative or enzymatic action (Seidman, 1979). These Maillard
type products are produced when glutamine reacts with reducing
sugars to produce substances with both characteristic taste and

flavor (FEMA, 1983).

In a 1970-71 Flavor and Extract Manufacturer's Association (FEMA)
and National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council
(NAS/NRC) study, it was estimated that less than 5000 pounds of
glutamine were used for flavorant purposes. In the absence of a
later survey, it is unknown whether this figure accurately
reflects flavorant usage two decades later. Approved food
additive levels are shown in Table III, and range from 10 to 350

parts per million (ppm) (FEMA, 1983).
