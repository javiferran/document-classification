In a sealed tube pyrolysis study, the pyrolyzate of L-glutamine,
when assayed against S. typhimurium strain T98 in the presence of
liver microsomal fraction S9, was formed to be mutagenic but less
mutagenic than the pyrolyzate from other amino acids such as

valine and tryptophan.

Chemical and Physical Properties:

Glutamine is the y-amide of the q-amino acid glutamic acid and a

biological reservoir of nitrogen as ammonia (Figure 1).
