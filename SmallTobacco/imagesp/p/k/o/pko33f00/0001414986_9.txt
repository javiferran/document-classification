individual amino acids were administered regularly for some
special reason would there be much likelihood of approaching toxic
levels. Even then, unless the protein intake of the subject was
low, it seems unlikely that quantities sufficient to produce more

than mild adverse effects would be ingested."

On p. 473 of the same article, the authors state:

"On the whole, the dispensable amino acids are tolerated much
better in excess than the indispensables and no unique toxic
effects of the dispensable amino acids have been reported, only
moderate growth depressions, even with substantial excesses of

many of them."

Few acute or chronic toxicity studies for glutamine have been
reported. Japanese workers, cited by RTECS (1987), report oral.
LDg 9 values for glutamine in the mouse as 21700 mg/kg and 7500
mg/kg in the rat. In another Japanese. study, glutamine was
administered orally to rats for 30 days at doses of 4.0, 6.0 and
10.0 g/kg/day as a comparison for an aluminum complex of
N-acetyl-L-glutamine, studied as a potential new drug for the
treatment of peptic ulcers. Effects on hematology, blood
chemistry, histopathology, organs and organ weights were
unremarkable. There was noted a slight but significiant reduction

in the growth rate of male rats at all three dose levels, but no

effect was noted in females (Ohguro et al., 1974).
