chromosomally abnormal embryos and offspring in humans. One of
these abnormalities is nondisjunction, the failure of chromosomal
separation and segregation, which results in production of oocytes
with aberrant chromosome numbers. In porcine oocytes, L-glutamine
significantly increased the incidence of nondisjunction at
concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mM. In hamster and denuded hamster
oocytes, L-glutamine increased nondisjunction at concentrations of
3.0 and 4.0 mM, respectively. In contrast, the incidence of
nondisjunction in rat oocytes was not increased significantly by
L-glutamine over a concentration range of 0-12.0 m™ (McGaughey,

1985).

Metabolism: During metabolic degradation, glutamine is converted
to a-ketoglutarate by either of two pathways: (1) deamination to
glutamic acid, followed by deamination; or (2) transamination of
the amide group to a keto-acid acceptor, forming a-ketoglutaramic
acid. The a-ketoglutaramic acid is then hydrolyzed to
a-ketoglutaric acid and ammonia. (Adelberg, 1982; Archibald,

«

1945).

Effects in Humans:

Recent studies on the safety and metabolic effects of glutamine -

enriched parental nutrient solutions in humans have shown that the
solutions are well tolerated with no associated signs of toxicity

in normal humans. (Lowe et al., 1990; Ziegler et al., 1990)
