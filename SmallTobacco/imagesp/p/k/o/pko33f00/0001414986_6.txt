degradation. In experimental animals, it has been shown that the
fall in glutamine concentrations in plasma and tissue pools that
occurs in the postoperative state can be prevented or reversed by
providing large quantities of exogenous glutamine. These
quantities required exceed the glutamine content of normal dietary
protein. This finding in experimental animals supports the
hypothesis that glutamine is a conditionally essential nutrient
rather than a non-essential amino acid and suggests a potentially
important role for glutamine - supplemented nutrition in catabolic

disease states. (Smith and Wilmore, 1990).

Glutamine plays a central role ina number of metabolic pathways.
With two readily mobilizable nitrogen groups, an ¥ -amino nitrogen
and an amide nitrogen, glutamine functions as a vehicle for the
transfer of nitrogen between tissues (Marliss et al., 1971), a
major substrate for renal ammoniagenesis pathways (Pitts, 1964)
and a precursor of nucleotides and other macromolecules (Levintow
et al., 1957). Glutamine is a potential regulator of glycogen
synthesis (Katz et al., 1976) and protein turnover (Rennie et al.,
1986; Jepson et al., 1988; Smith, 1984; MacLennan et al., 1987)
and is an important metabolic substance for cells of the
intestional mucosa (Windmueller, 1982) and many other rapidly
proliferating cells, such as stimulated lymphocytes (Newsholme et

al., 1985) and most cultured cells (Eagle, 1955; Eagle et al.,

1955; Zielke et al., 1978; Reitzer et al., 1979; McKeehan, 1982).
