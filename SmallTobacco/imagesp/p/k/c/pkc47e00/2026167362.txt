‘De-Nicotined’ Next Gets Pitched
By Philip Morris Just Like Decaf

Phillp Morris Cos. is betting that Next.
its “de-nicouned™ product. will do for:ciga-
rettes what its Sanka brand once did for:
coffee.

So it is no coincidence that the tobacco
giant: is pitching the new smoke: to con:
sumers just: like de-
caf. Packs of: Next
carry we word “De-
Nic’ beneath the p>
Next logo. The
brand's ads proudly
prociaum:. ‘“‘Intro-
ducing. de-nicotined
tobacco with rich
flavor." And, of
course; the copy.aiso
tells consumers that the nicotine-removal,
process is natural.

Philip Morris’s normally chatty tobacco
PR people are still refusing to talk about
the product or its positioning, even though!
Next is being tested in Toledo, Ohio:
Omaha, Neb.; and Hartford. Conn.. The:
campaign, created by Leo Burnett Co.. is:
appearing in local and national media in-:

 

- Cluding regional editions of Time, News-:

week and People.

But marketers speculate that the com-
pany’s “Smoke Sanka” strategy is de
signed to make low-nicotine Next seem as
soothingly (amillar to pulfers as possible.
“They Nave set up.a simple analogy.” adds
Al Ries. chairman of Trout & Ries: Ine.,

_ & New. York marketing-strategy firm. “In

the minds of people, having ‘a smoke anda
cup:of coffee tend to be things you do to-
gether.”

Moreover, the caffeine comparison en-

|. ables Philip Morris to imply it has a safer

scrutiny: At issue is: whether. consumers
interpret it to mean no nicotine or 90 little

. aleotine that there are'no health risks im-

volved. “This word is potentially misiead-
of the Coalition: on Smoking or Health.

“Some consumers will. consider. the prod-
uct to be safe or safer than other tobacco
products."

Marketers also question Next's focus on:
the issue of choice in the ad copy. Some:
ads boast that the brand “offers smokers a:
choice they have never had.” Others de-:

ad man for a rival tobacco company 'cau-

In any event, Philip Morris clearly be-
lieves it has'a winner on its hands... Distnb-

utors in the citles where the brandis being:
