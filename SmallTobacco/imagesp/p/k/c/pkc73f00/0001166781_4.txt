With the exception of RALEIGH LIGHTS, the Corporation's low tar

line extenaions are not yet sharing in their segmenta' growth.

 

Each established brand must improve on its low tar style's
performance to offset the continued decline of Brown & Williamson's
full-taste style. All of thie must be accomplished in an environment
in which the costs of doing business continue to escalate rapidly.

In 1981, total category media expenditures are projected to be

$822 million. Of this, $700 million will be spent against low tar
products (plus 11 percent versus 1980). Promotion expenditures are
increaaing proportionately. This cost escalation makes achieving
target volume within budget increasingly difficult and requires

efficient allocation of resources.

‘KOOL

In order for KOOL to achieve its objectives, the brand must develop
advertising that positively positions all styles in a manner con-
sistent with KOOL's historical strength as the menthol solution to
smokers! problems. This advertising will have to be extendable to
the utilization of non-traditional media and publicity to reach

non-literate franchise and prime prospects.

RALEIGH
RALEIGH's highly effective new advertising campaign will be initiated

 

with increased media support to generate greater unaided awareness
and new competitive trial/retrial. RALEIGH will also be using

} promotion publicity to retain franchise smokers and generate greater
trial. During the year, the brand will be testing promotion publicity

devices such as bowling, direct mail and selective sampling.
