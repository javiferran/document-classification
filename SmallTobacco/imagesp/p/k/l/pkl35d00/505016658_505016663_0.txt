The Project SPA timetable, leading to test market ~ By sat
9/29/86, is predicated upon finalizing prototype design and
completing flavor approximation and test design validation by
7/15/85 with product testing commencing 8/12/85. Standard
product testing methodology is judged inappropriate due to the
product's unique form and the necessity to maintain Project
security. Consequently, new test procedures have been
established to assist R&D's development efforts and to assess
product, per formance prior to market introduction. These
procedures will be validated (and evaluative measures
calibrated) utilizing conventional products prior to the first
round of SPA product testing. A "traditional" action standard
for "blind" product performance cannot be set because of
product uniqueness (form and benefit) and the limitations

imposed by security requirements.

Product development efforts will concentrate on the
non-menthol style since capacity constraints will probably
preclude simultaneous introduction of a menthol version.
However, to the extent feasible, menthol development will

parallel the non-menthol product.
