Phase III (Optional)

Phase III testing, if judged necessary, would involve
exposure of smokers to the actual product with full
exposure to the SPA concept as well. Participants (300
per cell) would smoke multiple cartons of each prototype.
Products would be evaluated versus "ideals," RJR
concept/product test "norms," and Merit (for attribute

diagnostic comparisons). Action Standard is parity with

concept/product test norms.

Phase III testing, if fielded, would need to be completed
by May, 198Â®. to provide sufficient turnaround time for

Phase IV testing.

Phase IV

Phase IV testing would be a Total Proposition Test
(Assessor) involving 600 smokers per cell. Participants
would be exposed to the SPA concept through presentation
of final advertising and given the opportunity to smoke
multiple cartons. Multiple cells would be used to assess
various pricing and/or advertising options. Action
Standard is attainment of an acceptable share level
projection (TBD by 7/85) as well as acceptable diagnostics

on advertising communication and product delivery.

Phase IV testing to be completed not later than August, 1986.
