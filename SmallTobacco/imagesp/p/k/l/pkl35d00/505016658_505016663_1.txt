Overview (cont'd)

The primary source of business for Project SPA is expected to
be among current FFLT/ULT smokers 25+, especially smokers of
"Moderation" and "Concerned" Segment brands. Since the
product wants of this group are generally consistent, a
representative target brand -- Merit -- has been selected as
the "benchmark" for product evaluation. Rationale for

we Merit is as follows:

nk is a "successful" FFLT entry with both regular and

de

Merit's tar (8 mg), nicotine (.5 mg) and carbon monoxide
ned

ple. ja

levels (9-10 mg) are mid-range.
© Merit's overall product ratings (F85 - 57; M85 - 53) are at
the category norm, representative of "acceptable" products,

and judged an achievable goal.

o Merit (F85 and M85) are cork-tipped products.

Product testing will be conducted only among 85mm FFLT smokers

25+ to simplify balancing of test cell composition and provide

a “clean" read of test results.
