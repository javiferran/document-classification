2. Product Test Plan

c. Phase II (Optional)
Phase II testing, if judged necessary, would involve

exposure of smokers to the actual product and a partial
concept to explain the unique product form as a new
technological innovation which provides full taste, but
delivers no tobacco tar. Participants (200 per cell)
would smoke 2-10 packs of each prototype (as determined
prior to fielding) in a "semi-blind" monadic test versus
Merit. Product performance would be rated against
"ideals" set by the test cell as well as concept/product
+east "norms." Attribute diagnostics would be also
evaluated versus Merit to isolate any potential product
problems or advantages. Action standard is parity with

RJR concept/product test norms.

Phase II testing. would be fielded as required in the
November, 1985-April, 1986 time frame.
