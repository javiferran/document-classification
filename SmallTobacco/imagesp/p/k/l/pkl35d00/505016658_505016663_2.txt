2. Product Test Plan
The product test plan is divided into a pre-test and four test
phases, described in detail below. The second and/or third

test phase could be bypassed if judged appropriate based on

evaluation of progress achieved up to that point.

a. Pre-Test

The pre-test is designed to validate test methodology and
calibrate evaluative measures for Phase I testing. Con-
ventional products will be used; otherwise, Phase I

procedures will be generally followed.

b. Phase I

Phase I testing will consist of a one-cigarette evaluation
utilizing a "white booth" to disguise product appearance.
The principle objective of Phase I is to provide direction

and guidance for R&D development efforts.

A maximum of eight test cells can be fielded on each test
wave (split between regular and menthol products as
required) with 200 smokers in each cell. The tentative

Phase I schedule is as follows:

Field Report
Wave I 8712/7685 OTB TEE
Wave II 10/24/85 11/25/85
Wave III 1/6/86 2/3/86
Wave IV (if required) 3/17/86 4/14/86

fl The development goal for Phase I testing)is parity to Merit
