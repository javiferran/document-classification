LIL. CONCLUSIONS

* Phenethyl isovalerate applied to tobacco rods
migrated steadily to the filters. After 11-13 weeks 55% was found
in the tobacco rods and 45% in the filters. Data from the
filtration experiment indicate a 52/48 filter/rod ratio after
16-17 weeks. Equilibration may not been have reached when this
study ended.

* When smoked in the “TRSA" with standard puffing
conditions, 14% (of which 88% was intact phenethy1 isovalerate)
of the phenethyl isovalerate transfers to MSTPM and 25% (of which
95% was intact phenethyl isovalerate) to SSTPM.

* Although it doesn’t appear to be as volatile, based on
comparison of migration and elution rates, phenethy]
isovalerate’s delivery rate to MSTPM (14%) is comparable to that
of more volatile components such as leaf alcohol (1),
l-octen-3-01 (2), and linalool (5).

* Phenethyl isovalerate’s MSTPM delivery is also comparable
to that of the less volatile cigarette component nicotine (9).

* The delivery of phenethyl isovalerate to MSTPM is
constant regardless of its distribution between filters and
tobacco rods prior to smoking.

* The filtration efficiency of WINSTON KS filters for
phenethyl isovalerate in smoke is 44% with standard puffing
conditions.

* 10% of the phenethyl isovalerate on the filters transfers
via elution to MSTPM which represents about 26% of the total
found in MSTPM. The amount that is eluted is replaced by a
similar amount that is removed from mainstream smoke by the
filters.

* Elution from the tobacco rod is not a significant factor
in delivery of phenethyl isovalerate to mainstream smoke. Over
half (55%) of the 5% of the phenethyl isovalerate that is eluted
from the tobacco rod to mainstream smoke is removed by the
cigarette filter.
