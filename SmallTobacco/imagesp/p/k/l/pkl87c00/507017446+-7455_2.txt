* Static burn experiments indicate that phenethy]
isovalerate does not distill (move) ahead of the approaching
thermal gradient and that about 50% of the amount on the tobacco
rod is pyrolysed and ends up in SSGASES as vapor phase.
Therefore, palf of the phenethyl isovalerate in the portion of
the tobacceâ€”rod that is burned during smolder periods of smoking
runs is degraded to vapor phase.

-* Lower SSGASES values from the total recovery smokings
compared to the static burn values and the low (less than 1%)
MSGASES values indicate very little production of volatile
phenethyl isovalerate thermal degradation products during the
puffing process.
