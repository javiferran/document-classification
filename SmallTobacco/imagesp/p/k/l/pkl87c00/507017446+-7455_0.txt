FATE OF 14C-LABELED PHENETHYL ISOVALERATE IN TOTAL SMOKE FROM
WINSTON KS CIGARETTES

OBJECTIVES:

An objective of this study was to determine the fate,
including transfer efficiencies, of phenethyl] jsovalerate in
total smoke from WINSTON KS (WKS) cigarettes. A further objective
was to determine the distribution of phenethyl isovalerate
between tobacco rod and filter as a function of time prior to
smoking.

SUMMARY:

Radiotracer studies with carbon-14 labeled phenethyl]
isovalerate have been performed and show that phenethyl]
isovalerate applied to tobacco rods (WKS) migrates to the
filters. After 8 weeks the ratio was 35% in the filters and 65%
in the rods. After 9 weeks this filter/rod ratio was 36/64 which
indicated a leveling off in the migration rate. Therefore,
smoking runs were begun. When smoked in the total recovery
smoking apparatus ("TRSA"), 14% (88% of which was intact
phenethyl isovalerate) of the total phenethyl isovalerate in the
cigarette transfered to MSTPM and 25% (95% of which was intact
phenethyl isovalerate) to SSTPM. Elution studies showed that
only a net 10% of the phenethyl isovalerate in the filters (about
3.5% of the total in the cigarette) was delivered to MSTPM which
represents 26% of the total in MSTPM. About 5% was eluted from
the tobacco rods to mainstream smoke, 55% of which was removed by
the filters. The unsmoked filters from the rod elution study
were analysed and indicated a 40/60 phenethy] isovalerate
filter/rod distribution at 10 weeks. Therefore, additional
sacrifices were performed at 11 and 13 weeks and filter/rod .
distributions of 45/55 were found at each time indicating another
leveling in the migration rate. Data from the filtration studies
indicate a 52/48 filter/rod ratio after 16-17 weeks.
Equilibration may not have been reached when this study ended;
however, the amount of phenethyl] isovalerate in MSTPM was
constant regardless of the distribution prior to smoking. The
filtration efficiency of WINSTON KS filters for phenethyl
isovalerate was 44% at standard puffing conditions.
