Draft ~~ 1/25/91

- Perhaps most importantly, advertising §s the foundation on
which the free press and media vital to our democracy are
built. As the Ist Amendment scholar Professor. Burt Neuborne of
New York University points out, "advertising finances virtually
al? organs of mass communication in free societies. Speech
about religion, politics, scfence and art is literally carried
on the shoulders of commercial speech.”

The free exchange of words and ideas -- whether for political or commercial
ends ~~ is essential to democracy and, while some may occasionally find
certain words or ideas unpleasant or disagreeable, the integrity of the
exchange must be maintained. Even then, each of us has the freedom to not
tisten to whatever we choose. .

For more than two centuries, that freedom to decide whether to speak, to
listen or not to listen has made America the world's leading democracy.

Today, an important part of that liberty is in jeopardy. We can preserve that
liberty -- but as Clarence Darrow once said, "You can protect your liberties
in this world only by protecting the other man's freedom. You can be free
only if I am free." It is time for ali members of the advertising comnunity
to join together to protect each other's freedom.
