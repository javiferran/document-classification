- IN THE TEST ANIMALS, THE SQUAMOUS METAPLASIA WAS VERY.
MINIMAL (PLATE V) AND WAS ONLY NOTED IN THE HIGH
DOSE GROUPS. THE CHANGE WAS ONLY SEEN IN A VERY
PRECISE AREA OF THE LARYNX (AT THE BASE OF THE
EPIGLOTTIS). THE DATA GIVEN IN TABLE 3 EXCLUDE
THOSE SECTIONS WHERE THE SUB-EPITHELTAL GLANDS WERE
ABSENT, SECTIONS WHICH WERE CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE
WRONG ANATOMICAL AREA FOR THE CHANGE DESCRIBED ABOVE.

- THE MINIMAL CHANGE IN THE TEST GROUPS WAS COMPLETELY
REVERSIBLE IN THE TEST GROUPS; THE CHANGE INDUCED IN
THE REFERENCE ANIMALS WAS NOT COMPLETELY RESOLVED AT
THE END OF THE REVERSIBILITY PERIOD (TABLE 3).

- THE SQUAMOUS METAPLASIA IN THE REFERENCE ANIMALS WAS
ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC, ACTIVE INFLAMMATION. THIS
CHANGE CONSISTS OF SUB- AND INTRA-EPITHELIAL
INFILTRATIONS OF LYMPHOCYTES, HISTIOCYTES, AND LESSER
NUMBERS OF NEUTROPHILS AND EOSINOPHILS. THE CHANGE
WAS SEEN WITH INCIDENCE VERY SIMILAR TO THAT NOTED
FOR THE SQUAMOUS METAPLASIA, FOR BOTH THE 90-pay AND
REVERSIBILITY ANIMALS. THERE WAS NO INFLAMMATORY
RESPONSE IN THE LARYNGES OF THE TEST ANIMALS.
