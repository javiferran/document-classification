DISCUSSION

THE RESPONSES PRODUCED IN THE REFERENCE CIGARETTE
GROUPS WERE VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE REPORTED IN THE
LITERATURE. SMOKE-INDUCED ATROPHY OF THE OLFACTORY
EPITHELIA HAS NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED IN RATS,
ALTHOUGH THERE IS A REPORT ON SUCH A CHANGE IN
SMOKE-EXPOSED MICE [4].

THERE WERE SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS IN THE HISTOPATHOLOGY
PRODUCED IN THE TEST CIGARETTE GROUPS WHEN COMPARED
WITH THAT PRODUCED IN THE REFERENCE GROUPS. THIS
DIFFERENCE WAS ESPECIALLY NOTABLE FOR MUCUS PRODUCING
CELLS IN THE CONDUCTING AIRWAYS. MANY OF THE CHANGES
NOTED IN THE REFERENCE GROUPS WERE NOT SEEN IN THE TEST
GROUPS. IN MOST CASES, THE ANIMALS IN THE TEST GROUPS
WERE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE NON-EXPOSED CONTROLS.

THE SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN HISTOPATHOLOGY BETWEEN
TEST AND REFERENCE GROUPS ARE EVEN MORE REMARKABLE WHEN
THE AMOUNTS OF MATERIAL INHALED ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.
DaTA (PostTER # 1008) INDICATE THAT ANIMALS IN THE HIGH
DOSE TEST GROUPS INHALED UP TO TWICE AS MUCH MATERIAL
DURING THEIR EXPOSURES THAN DID ANIMALS IN THE HIGH
DOSE REFERENCE GROUPS.
