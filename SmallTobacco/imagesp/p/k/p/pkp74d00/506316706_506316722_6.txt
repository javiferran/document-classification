- IN section II ATROPHY OF THE OLFACTORY EPITHELIUM WAS
NOTED, IN THE HIGH DOSE REFERENCE ANIMALS (PLATE
III). No EVIDENCE OF THIS CHANGE WAS SEEN IN THE
ANIMALS EXPOSED TO SMOKE FROM THE TEST CIGARETTE.

- THE NASAL CHANGES INDUCED IN THE HIGH DOSE REFERENCE
GROUPS WERE ONLY PARTIALLY REVERSIBLE; THE MINIMAL
CHANGES INDUCED IN THE TEST ANIMALS WERE COMPLETELY
REVERSIBLE (TABLE 2).

LARYNX

- SQUAMOUS METAPLASIA OF THE VENTRAL EPITHELIUM WAS
SEEN IN ALL OF THE REFERENCE ANIMALS. THIS CHANGE
WAS SEEN THROUGHOUT THE ORGAN, AND WAS SIMILAR IN
INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY (TABLE 3) TO THAT REPORTED IN
THE LITERATURE [2, 3] FOR THIS PARTICULARLY
RESPONSIVE ORGAN.

- IN THIS CHANGE THE NORMALLY "PSEUDOSTRATIFIED"
CUBOIDAL TO LOW COLUMNAR EPITHELIUM WAS TRANSFORMED
TO A STRATIFIED SQUAMOUS EPITHELIUM, IN WHICH THERE
WAS A TYPICAL PROGRESSION OF MATURATION OF BASAL
CELLS TO FLATTENED LAYERS OF KERATINIZED,
DESQUAMATING CELL REMNANTS (PLaTE IV).
