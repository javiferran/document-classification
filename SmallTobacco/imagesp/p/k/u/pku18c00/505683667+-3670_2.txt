replicating those proven_successful with 1984-introductory
efforts. Introductory plans for the remaining two states,
New York and New Jersey, and the District of Columbia are
still contingent on legislative status in those taxing
jurisdictions. ~

Menthol Line Extensions

Introduce menthol full flavor 85's and 100's line extensions

in approximately 20% of the U.S., commencing January, 1985.
The regional introduction will be confined to markets which
exhibit high menthol, CENTURY and Generics development.

Special Markets

Implement media and promotion programs targeted to military
markets capitalizing on CENTURY's appeal to these smokers.

Key Strategic Changes in 1985
1. Objective
No change.

2. Overall Strategy

CENTURY's overall strategy reflects an increase on the
Brand's relative product quality as compared to a 1984
strategic emphasis on establishing its savings benefit.
While communication of CENTURY's savings aspect remains
important, 1985 planning assumes significant progress
against this communications goal in 1984.

3. Brand Positidning

No change.

ao Spending

Media spending will receive greater priority in 1985

versus a 1984 promotional spending emphasis. An increased

level of media spending is necessary to build awareness
of CENTURY's proposition among the greatest number of
target smokers possible. Aggressive promotion spending
was necessary in 1984 to reverse a declining 85mm share
trend, to stimulate broad trial and to generate carton
purchase.

5. Geographic Emphasis

Media and Promotion program implementation will be more
highly concentrated on a geographical basis versus 1984
