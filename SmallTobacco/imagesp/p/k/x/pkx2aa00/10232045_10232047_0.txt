CiGaReTTE SMOKE INHIBITS PROTEIN SYNTHESIS

The body's ability to manufacture proteins; a function which is absolutely
essential to many life processes, appears to be affected by cigarette smoke,
according to research published in the May, 1979 issue of The Journal of
Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.

University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy researchers Ruby J.B. Garrett, PhD,
and M.A. Jackson have found that cigarette smoke inhibits protein synthesis in
’ the livers of experimental rats. Carbon moncxide, the investigators speculated,
may be the smoke component responsible for this inhibition, altering protein
synthesis by directly interfering with the protein synthesizing machinery or by
reducing oxygen levels in the cell to such an extent that the energy molecules
needed to drive protein synthesis camot be produced. .

Dr. Garrett is a member of The American Physiological Society, part of the
Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.

A number of recent studies have shown that smokers and nonsmokers react
differently to many drugs. One reason may be increased drug metabolism in
cigarette smokers caused by the induction of special drug-metabolizing enzymes
after chronic exposure to cigarette smoke.

Some investigators have shown that enzyme induction is related to protein
synthesis. With this in mind, the Kentucky researchers set out to deternine
the inmediate effect of acute smoke exposure on protein synthesis.

The experiments were carried out on laboratory rats exposed to either 15 or
60 puffs of cigarette smoke at a rate of one puff per minute. A “gingle-port
reverse smoking machine"' was used to generate puffs similar to those normally
