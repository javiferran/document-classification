CIGARETTE SMOKE (CONTINUED)

taken py human smokers. Smoke was delivered filterless or through cambridge
filters, which remove particulate matter, or charcoal filters, which remove some
gases. In additional experiments, rats were exposed to carbon monoxide at
levels comparable to those in cigarette smoke.

After the smoking period, the investigators measured protein synthesis in |
the animals' livers, The liver was chosen for this analysis because it is the
major site for biotransformation processes--the breakdown of foreign chemicals
before their removal from the body--and because liver enzymes are known to be
affected by cigarette smoke,

The Kentucky researchers found that after only 15 puffs of smoke, protein

synthesis was significantly reduced, compared to protein synthesis in nonsmoking

control rats. The extent of inhibition, the investigators also discovered, was
directly related to the number of puffs received; the more smoke the animals
received, the greater was the reduction in their protein synthesis.

In their parallel experiments with the charcoal and cambridge filters, the
researchers found that neither filter eliminated the inhibition effect. Some

component of cigarette smoke not removed by these filters, the investigators

â€˜reasoned, must be responsible for reducing protein synthesis. Their hunch that

carbon monoxide, a cigarette smoke component removed by neither a charcoal nor
a cambridge filter, might be involved paid off in the final experiment which
showed that exposure to carbon monoxide alone inhibits liver protein synthesis.
Garrett and Jackson have yet ts expiain exactly how cigarette smoke or
carbon monoxide affect protein synthesis, The effect, the researchers added,

probably changes with chronic exposure to cigarette smoke. The initial
