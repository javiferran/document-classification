Andretti puts an end
to Penske win streak

By The Associated Preas

Michael Andretti hopes a turnaround
for his season came along with a domi-
nating victory Sunday in-the Toronto
Molson-Indy.

If it did, though, Andretti says the
reason is probably off the track, where
Chip Ganassl Racing recently signed
veteran IndyCar engineer Mo Nunn to
help get things sorted out.

Whatever made the difference,
though, the 31-year-old Andretti was
able to outrace a variety of troubles
Sunday to end Team Penske’s seven-
race winning streak and earn his
fourth Toronto victory.

Andretti, whose best finish since an
opening-day victory in Australia was
fourth place last month at Milwaukee,
took control after bumping and passing
Nigel Mansell for the lead on lap 26 as
the defending series champion’s right-
rear tire deflated.

“I was staying right on Nigel,” Andret-
ti explained, “I tried to get past him
once and almost wound up in a tire
barrier, Then I tapped him a little and
just got by him a few turns later. I
didn’t know he was having any problem
with his tlre. 1 didn’t see that.”

Andretti was virtually unchallenged
the rest of the 98-lap, 174.44-mile race,
beating Bobby Rahal to the finish by 6.8
seconds in earning his 29th career Indy-
Car victory.

“This is a big win for us,” Andretti
said. “We started out on a real high
with the win in Australia, then every-
thing went downhill. It seemed the
harder we worked, the slower the car
would go.

“We needed a change and we were

fortunate that Mo Nunn left Simon Rac-
ing (last month), We went out and got
Mo to work with Julian Robertson, my
engineer all year long. They make a
super team. Hopefully, we're on the
way.”

Nunn was the chief engineer for Em-
erson Fittipadli in his championship
season of 1989,

Geoff Bodine kept insisting that Hoo-
Stier tires would withstand the rigors of
& long race, and proved it with what
amounted to a Sunday drive in the Mill-
er Genuine Draft 500 at Long Pond, Pa.

The victory at Pocono International
Raceway was the first this year for the
Indiana-based race tire manufacturer,
Cars running on the Goodyear brand
had won the first 16 races on the
NASCAR Winston Cup circuit.

“You're going to see a lot more Hao-
sler cars in Victory Lane this year,”
Bodine said. “We're proud of what (Hoo-
sier president) Bob Newton and his peo-
ple have done.”

Bodine, who won the pole in a Ford
Thunderbird with a speed of 163.689
mph, led 156 of 200 laps and beat Ward
Burton by 1.26 seconds for his first vic-
tory this season. It was the 14th win of
Bodine's career.
