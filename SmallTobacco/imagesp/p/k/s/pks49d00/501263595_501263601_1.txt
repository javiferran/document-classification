BRIGHT CONSUMER TRACKING AMONG BLACK SMOKERS

(MDD #82-43203)

BACKGROUND

BRIGHT is an innovative low tar 85mm/100mm cigarette positioned primarily
against menthol smokers. It is designed to deliver a unique new taste which
is fresher during smoking and leaves a clean fresh aftertaste. BRIGHT
entered test market in Michigan, Oklahoma, and Colorado on July 5, 1982.

Pre-market research has suggested that Black menthol smokers represent a
potential incremental share opportunity for the Brand. As a part of the test
market research program developed for BRIGHT, the awareness, trial, purchase
and repeat purchase levels for BRIGHT were tracked among Black menthol
smokers in the Detroit Metro area. The acceptance and penetration levels of
BRIGHT among these smokers should provide direction for possible modification
of the Brand's national expansion marketing plan.

METHODOLOGY

The brand usage, recent purchase behavior, and brand awareness of 285 Black
menthol smokers in the Detroit Metro area was obtained six to eight weeks
after BRIGHT entered test market. These smokers were recontacted during
weeks ten, twelve, and fourteen following DTS to track trial, promotion
penetration, purchase, and repeat purchase of the Brand. One hundred
sixty-one of the original 285 Black menthol smokers participated through week
fourteen.

RESULTS
I. AWARENESS
A. During the six to eight week period, awareness of BRIGHT among Black
menthol smokers exceeded that of Barclay, but was below the aware-
ness levels of B&H Deluxe and SALEM Slim Lights. Some confusion

with other styles may be inflating awareness of B&H Deluxe and SALEM
Slim Lights, however.
