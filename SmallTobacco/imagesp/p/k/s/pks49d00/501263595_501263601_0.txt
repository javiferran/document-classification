BRIGHT CONSUMER TRACKING AMONG BLACK SMOKERS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

BACKGROUND

BRIGHT is an innovative low tar 85mm/100mm cigarette positioned primarily
against menthol smokers. It is designed to deliver a unique new taste which
is fresher during smoking and leaves a clean fresh aftertaste. BRIGHT entered
test market in Michigan, Oklahoma, and Colorado on July 5, 1982.

Pre-market research has suggested that Black menthol smokers represent a
potential incremental share opportunity for the Brand. As a part of the test
market research program developed for BRIGHT, the awareness, trial, purchase
and repeat purchase levels for BRIGHT were tracked among Black menthol smokers
in the Detroit Metro area. The acceptance and penetration levels of BRIGHT

among these smokers should provide direction for possible modification of the
Brand's national marketing plan.

CONCLUSIONS

Sampling was the most important source of initial brand awareness and
trial for BRIGHT among Black smokers. Sampling may be particularly

important in generating trial among Blacks in economically depressed
areas.

Trial was effectively converted into purchase of the Brand. By week
fourteen, over one-half of all Black menthol smokers who had ever tried
BRIGHT had also purchased it. Repeat purchase averaged 37% over the
three tracking periods and appeared to be fairly stable over time. The
appeal of the BRIGHT proposition was strongest among females, smokers
aged 25-34, and those earning less than $15,000.

BRIGHT's unique taste appeared to result in polarized perceptions among
Black triers. The attributes most strongly liked were also most
strongly disliked, which supports other research results.
