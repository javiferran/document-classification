CONCLUSIONS

o

â€œ e Sampling was the most important source of initial brand awareness and
trial for BRIGHT among Black Smokers. Sampling may be particularly
important in generating trial among Blacks in economically depressed

areas.

e Trial was effectively converted into purchase of the Brand. By week
fourteen, over one-half of all Black menthol smokers who had ever tried
BRIGHT had also purchased it. Recent purchase averaged 37% over the
three tracking periods and appeared to be fairly stable over time. The
appeal of the BRIGHT proposition was strongest among Black females,
smokers aged 25-34, and those earning less than $15,000.

BRIGHT's unique taste appeared to result in polarized perceptions among

Black triers. The attributes most strongly liked were also most
strongly disliked, which supports other research on BRIGHT.
