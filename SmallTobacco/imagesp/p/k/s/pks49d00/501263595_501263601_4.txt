The profile of Black menthol triers of BRIGHT remained constant
throughout the test. BRIGHT was tried more by females and smokers
aged 25-34. As the initial BRIGHT trial from sampling suggests,
sampling will be particularly important in generating trial among

Blacks. (See Table II.)

B. Purchase

By week fourteen of the test market, over one-half of all Black
menthol smokers who had ever tried BRIGHT had also purchased it.
