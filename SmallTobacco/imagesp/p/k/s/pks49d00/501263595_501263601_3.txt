II. TRIAL/PURCHASE

A.

Trial

Over one-fourth (27.7%) of Black menthol smokers had tried BRIGHT
by the six to eight week period of the test market. Sampling was
the primary source of initial trial and was a more effective trial
generator for BRIGHT than any other major brand. Pass-along was a
less important source of initial BRIGHT trial, however, than for
other recent new brands.

The recent trial level of BRIGHT was comparable to B&H Deluxe and
SALEM Slim Lights over time and averaged about 17% until week
fourteen. During week fourteen, trial declined for BRIGHT and each
of the brands tracked in the study. The relative rates of trial
between the brands remained the same, however.
