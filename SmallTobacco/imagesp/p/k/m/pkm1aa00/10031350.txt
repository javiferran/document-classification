Take Your Choice
Of These Reports

Another medical group has come
with what it calls “incon‘revertible”
fence on cigarctte smoking in relatio
cancer. The “incontrovertible” evidenc
fered by this group holds that ciga
smokers are far more susceptible to
cancer then those who do not smoke
srettes

This ‘bit of study from this partic
study group follows similarly “incoi
vertible” evidence from a previous g
that there was no proyable relation
tween cigarette smoking and lung ca
That report, in turn, followed a previou
port that cigarettes did cause lung ca!
That's the way it seems to go.

Some cigaretts smokers ‘will arop
habit or cut it muteriaily on the basis of
Jatest report. Perhaps in time another
controvertible” report will come out on
cigarette side and then those who quit
grettes will go back to them. Regarile:
the reports, a lot of cigarette smokers
go right ahead feeling that when the:
go much smoke nobody knows where
fire may be.

The situation has been reached w
the average layman finds himself spin
around amid “incontrovertible” rep
each contradicting the other. Only one t
seems certain: If you are going to a
elther side of the issue be sure that
have today's “incontrovertible” report
not yesterday's.
