SUBJECT: WARNING STATEMENT

TIMING

Inasmuch as the new SALEM newspaper campaign is breaking about
May 15 with the Warning Statement, it_is desirable for all of

our brands using new: newspaper _to also begin using the Waxning
Statement about the same time. This does not mean that we

should scrap existing material or go into overtime in order

to accomplish this objective. However, any new units oF
currently being prepared for use in newspaper should include

the Warning Statement.

fhe timing for the appearance of the Warning Statement in
magazines and out-of-home media is shown on the attached sheet.
. The scheduling was agreed to by the Brands as the earliest
practical date for use of the Warning Statement in these media.

These timing instructions do not supersede the instructions
you have received earlier giving you the final date of
compliance, but they are intended to coordinate all brands'
scheduling so that the Warning Statement will begin to appear
about the same time in all our brand advertising.

Please advise if you have questions regarding this timing.
CHECKING PROCEDURE
