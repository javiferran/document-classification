NEW . YORK’ —(2)— A broad
study seeking knowledge of
whether cigarets or other forms
of tobacco cause lung cancer or
other health hazards was an-
nounced Tuesday

It is the first announcement
of a big research program head-
ed by the scientific advisory
board of the Tobacco Indus
Research committee, .

IT WILL INCLUDE numer
ous studies of humans, includ-
ing emotional habits of smok-
ers, as well as tests on animals.

Only the broad aspects of the
Tesearch program were dis-
closed yesterday. Specific re.
search grants will be announced
later. The board has $500,000 to
work with.

“We will tackle simultane.
ously many of the unknowns in
this field of tobacco use in re-
lation to human health,” said
Dr. Clarence Cook Little, Bar
Harbor, Maine, chairman of the
research board.

Statisticat studies and experi-
menis recently linked smoking,
especially cigarets, with a rapid
rise in human lung cancer. Ciga-
rets also have been charged
with creating an ‘extra hazard
of causing heart attacks,

BUT SOME sscienlisis. and
physicians have said they are
by no means convinced, or
doubt there is any link.

Little’s board said it will co-
ordinate research in these six
gentral areas:

A study of human lung can-
cer in 10 major medical centers
in the United States and Can-
ada, checking lungs for evi-
dences of the sites and time of
beginning of cancer.

Study of animals while inhal-
ing smoke under controlled
conditions, to see if there are
effects on lung cancer, growth
rates, heart and blood vessels,
and nervous tissues.

Study of the effect of known
smoke tars, obtained under con-
trolled conditions, on tissues of
animals which naturally vary
in their susceptibility to cancer
or other diseases.

Study of lung cardiovascular
(heart-blood vessel) tissues in
living humans and animals.

Surveys of groups of people
in various parts of the nation
concerning characteristics of
smokers. Age, sex, emotional
habits, environmental factors
as well as smoking histories
will be analyzed.

Development of sources for
& continuous supply of tobacco
smoke and its deratives for use
in a variety of experiments. Et.
forts will be made to duplicate
human smoke by machines.

hazards was announced Tues-
day.

It is the first announcement
of a big research program head-
ed by the scientific advisory
board of the Tobacco Industry
Research Committee (TIRC).

It will include numerous
studies of humans, including
emotional habits of smokera,
as well as tests on animals,

Only the main broad aspects
of the research were disclosed.
The specific research grants, fi-
maced by the TIRC, will be an-
nounced later.

“We will tackle simultaneous-
ly many of the unknowns in
this field of tobacco use in re-
lation to human health,” said
Dr. Clarence Cook Little, Bar
Harbor, Me., board chairman.

“We seek definitive findings
in an area where much sug-
gestive work has been done.
The program recognizes we do
not have today the experiment-
al evidence that will permit
scientific conclusions regarding
the cause and effect relationship
between environmental factors,
including smoking, and lung
cancer.”

One researcher who linked
cancer with cigaret smoking,
meanwhile, recommended that
the cigaret industry try to pro-
auce a “safe” cigaret, rather
than undertake the “nearly im-
possible task of proving con-
clusively” whether smoking is
a factor in cancer or heart
disease.

He is Dr. E. Cuyler Ham-
mond, statistical director of
the American Cancer Society.
Addressing the ACS annual
meeting, he said there is “hope”
of producing a “safe” cigaret.
It will take far longer to define
cigaret smoking’s effects on the
body than fo produce a tobacco
which can be shown to have
less harmful effect on respira-
tion and heartbeat, he said,
