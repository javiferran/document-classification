GRACE: A technical meeting is scheduled for this Thursday,
July 9, with Mr. Joe Porinchak. The primary topics of
discussion are:

1. Results of RJRT's physical and performance analysis
of recent samples. These results will be used to
plan future technical development direction.

2. Determine a schedule for future development.

3. Discuss results with flow agents and plana
development schedule for obtaining production
quantities of Syloid with larger particle size.

An extended test run on the Bosch capsule filling
machine started this morning, 7/6. The test run is using
Grace D2 substrate, with the Tox. II load. Grace Syloid 63
FF is applied, by hand at 0.6% by weight, as a flow agent
just before actual use. The material was loaded in Shed 112.

ALCOA: The material produced by Alcoa at Fuller, early in
June, was received at Lawrence Transfer, late last week. A
total of nine drums were received, equalling a little less
than 3,100 lbs. This material will be brought to 602-4 early
this week and drum samples will be submitted for complete
physical analysis.

KAISER: A technical meeting was held at Kaiser's facility in
Baton Rouge, on June 30. The discussion resulted in the
following development schedule:
