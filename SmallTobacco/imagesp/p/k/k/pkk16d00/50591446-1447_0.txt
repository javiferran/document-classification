Research experience:
T have 46 primary publications dating back to 1959. One of my earliest studies

was a comparison of dCMP deaminase activity in normal and malignant mammalian
tissue (Cancer Res. 23, 454, 1963). Many of my earlier publications involved
kinetic studies of various enzymes derived from normal and malignant tissue.
In 1967, I (with Drs. E. Borek and P.R. Srinivasan) provided the first
demonstration of mammalian DNA methylase (Biochem. 7, 280). In 1967, I joined
Dr. Alex Novikoff in the Department of Pathology at the Albert Einstein College
of Medicine where I continued studies in nucleic acid metabolism in addition to
learning electron microscopic techniques. In 1969, I joined the SUNY Health
Science Center as an Assistant Professor of Pharmacology and expanded my research
to include experimental cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy. In addition to
my research, I have for the past 21 years been teaching cancer chemotherapy and
immunotherapy to medical students, house staff and practicing physicians
(Continuing Education) at the Medical Center and affiliated hospitals.
