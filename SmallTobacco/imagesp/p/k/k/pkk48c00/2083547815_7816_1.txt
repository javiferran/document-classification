about the safety testing,” Nasa
said, “It appears that rats and mice
probably will be sufficient. Qnce
we get those results, we will be
ready to start human trials, proba-
bly within a year.”

At this point, there are no known
side effects, but there is a possibili-
ty some might arise during human
trials, Just how long the vaccine
will work cannot be determined
unti] itis used in humans. Booster
shots might be necessary.

The idea for the vaccine
stemmed from the development af
another vaccine — fo protect peo-
ple from staphylococcus infection,
a major problem in hospitals ard
nursing homes. That vaccine is ina
final stage of human clinical triais.

“Nic-VAX came out of the exper-
tise we gained in developing the

staph vaccine,” said Ali Fattom,
Nabisenior director for research.

“We had developed some fairly so-
phisticated chemical technology,
and we were locking at how else
we could apply it.”

With all the publicity surround-
irnig lawsuits against the tobacco in-
dustry and an attempt by the FDA
to regulate tobacco as a drug, the
Nabi development team saw an op-
portunity in trying to counter drugs
of abuse, notably nicotine.

The concept is not new. Scientif-
ic literature dating to tne 1960s al-
ludes to the process, but no such
vaccines were produced, The tech-
nology simply didn't exist, Nabi
scientists said,

This is how it works:

Because nicotine molecules are
very tiny, they can pass easily from
the bloodstream into the brain. The
body doesn't even recognize them.

“These molecules are flying un-
der the radar of the immune sys-
tem,” thé National Institute on
Drug Abuse‘s Vacci said,

The vaccine contains nicotine
molecules bonded to protein mole-
cules. The cambination is large
enough so that the bady produces
antibodies to this foreign sub-
stance. When a person smokes,
bringing nicatine from the ciga-

 

 

rette into the bloodstream, the anii-
bodies bind those molecules, and
because df their size, prevent them

from entering the brain. In effect,

the nicotine has been neutralized.
Because the nicotine never

reaches the brain, there is no reac-

tion to the drug and no further ad- —

diction. Regular smokers probably
still would experience withdrawal
symptoms.

“We helieve the vaccine will be
most effective in people who were
longtime smokers and quit recent-
ly. They are prone to relapse be-
cause they get an exaggerated re-
sponse when they light up another
cigarette,” Vocci said, “We also see
great hope in heiping intermittent
smokers — adolescents and others
who are not yet dependent on ciga-
reites.” :

Less likely to be helped, he said,
are those who have been smoking
at least two or three years, con-
sume a pack a day und are essen-
ually hooked on the nicotine. The
prime reason: Many of these smok-
ers don'i want to quit or don’t be-
lieve they can. :

But Nabi scientists hope they
can have an impact on that group,
as well. .

“Without nicotine getting into
the brain, the cigarette probably
won't taste very god toa longtime
smoker,” research director Fattom
said. "Ic might just taste like burnt
paper.” ~

With little satisfaction from their
cigarettes, even hardened smokers
might be more tempted to quit the
habit. he said.

Nabi officials thought they
might actually interest cigarette
companies in the vaccine, but the
Gutcome wasn'l encouraging. A
year ago, Naso wrote to Philip Mor-

ris Companies inc. and R.J. Reyn-
olds Tobacco Holdings Inc,, pre-
senting an overview of the project
and seeking their participation.
R.J. Reynolds never responded,
and Philip Morris wasn’t interest-
ed, Its assistant chief counsel, Kev-
in.Osborne, wrote to Naso that the

 

Pawe

cigarette maker maintains a “poli
cy of declining to review or consid
er submissions such as yours."

Nabi scientists also are discuss-
ing another use for the vaccine --
to prevent young people from start-
ing to smoke, They expect this idea
to breed controversy.

"There is the possibility that par-
ents might want to have their chi!-
dren inoculated so they never will
become hooked on cigarettes," Iva
so said. “It does make sense. After
all, we use vaccines to protect oui
kids from polio and other diseases
Why not nicotine?” :
