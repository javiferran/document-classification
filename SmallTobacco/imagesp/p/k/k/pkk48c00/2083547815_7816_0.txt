ROCKVILLE, Md. — Let's face
it. Nisn’t easy to quit smoking.

Mast of us know people who
have tried smoking cessation clas-
ses, nicotine patches, nicotine gum,
the drug Zyban and even hypnosis
—and then went back ta their
pack-a-day habit.

Now, scientists at Nabi, a Boca
Raton-based biopharmaceutical
company, are working on a new

approach.

and technical
support from
the National
Institute on
Drug Abuse,
they are devel-
oping a vac-
cine to prevent
nicetine from
reaching the
Naso brain and trig-
gering chemi-
cal reactions that cause addiction.

“You can try to quit smoking, but
the addiction is always there. The
desire to smoke hardly ever goes
away,” said Robert Naso, a Nabi se-
lor vice president who oversees
product development at company
laboratories in Maryland.

Nabi, which previously special-
ized in collecting and providing
plasma to other pharmaceutical
manufacturers, now focuses its re-
search and development efforts on
creating and marketing drugs that
prevent and treat infectious and au-
to-immune diseases.

The company has several clini-

cal trials under way in these areas,
and has four pharmaceutical prod-
ucts on the market. Sales of phar-
maceutical and antibody products
generated $234 million in 1999 for

Nabi, which has 1,750 employees.

It had $3.3 million in net income
last year. Its stock has been trading
in the $5-6 range recently and
closed on Friday at $4.88.

The idea to create an anti-smok-
ing vaccine came, in part, from the
development ofan unrelated vac-
cine for staphylococcus infections
that uses similar technology.

The key to getting someone to
stop smoking is to find a way to sti-
fle the desire, Nabi scientists be-
lieve they can accomplish that with
an injectable vaccine that not only
prevents nicotine molecules from
passirig from the bloodstream inta

- the brain, but also prompts the im-

mune systern to create antibodies
that eliminate nicotine from the
body.

“It’s a fascinating concept —
novel and unique," said Frank Voc-
ct, director of the division of treat-
ment, research and development
for the National Institute on Drug
Abuse. “The methods we have used
to date don’t really work that well.
This could be a real advancement.”

The institute announced in April
that it had awarded Nabi a four-
year grant to conduct further tests
on animals, particularly those re-
laled to safety, and then conduct
human trials. The first year’s por-
fion, $776,000, will be released
Sept. 30.

and the vaccine is approved by the
Food and Drug Administration
Nic-VAX, as itis called, could be
available by 2005, Naso said, The
company is seeking a partner to
help pay development costs thai

The partner also is needed to heip
sell the product in the United
Siates, and, possibly, around the
warld.

“We think there’s a tremendous
potential market for the vaccine
worldwide,” Naso said. “Cleariy,
this would be a high-valued prod-
uct, but it’s far too early to talk
about price.”

The scope of the potential niar-
ket is huge.

according to the American Psychi-
atric Assaciation.

Nabi scientists and their collaba-
rators in Minneapolis and Housten
are growing excited about the po-
ject, now that efficacy testing im
