GLUCOSE ISOMERASE

I have been using the resorcinol method in determining the fructose
produced by isomerase reaction. Although this method is sensitive enough
to detect 0.025 uMoles of fructose, the reproducibility was unsatisfactory.
Therefore, I sought a method which allows best differential measurement of
fructose in the presence of large quantities of glucose with dependable
reproducibility. The improved method was obtained by modifying the con-
ditions employed for the resorcinol method. Briefly, the new method js
as follows: 1.0 ml. of sample containing 0.1 to 5.0 yMoles of fructose,
3.0 ml. of 12.2 N HC1, and 1.0 ml. of 0.05% resorcinol in absolute ethanol
are incubated at 60° C. for 5 minutes and cooled immediately at 0°. Absorb-
ance measured at 410 my» shows linear relationship with the concentration of
fructose. In this method, 100 pMoles of glucose give the same optical
density as 0.45 uMoles of fructose (220 fold); whereas, in the old method,
35 uMoles of glucose were equivalent to 0.25 yMoles of ghicose (140 fold)
in the optical density. fy tee

The effort to purify the isomerase brought some progress. The protamine
sulfate treated extract was subjected to acetone fractionation and then
ammonium Sulfate fractionation. The combined treatment resulted in about
tenfold increase in specific activity with 90% recovery. Further purifi-
cation by means of column chromatography is now under progress.

ANALYTICAL SERVICE

Five hundred eighty-two samples of maltose and 60 samples of fructose
were analyzed during the period of July 13 to August 13.
