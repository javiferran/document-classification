ANALYST IMPRESSIONS

I listened to several impromptumedia interviews of Analysts.
In general, the Analysts' answers were precise, low-key and

favorable about the development.

They also refused to speculate on questions designed to

elicit a negative and/or controversial response.

John of the Wall Street Journal asked one analyst if this
product failed would it “be like the introduction of new.

Coke?" the answer was:

"Of course not; Coke withdrew a product and RJR is not doing
that. Also this is nowhere near the same level of spending

and commitment.

Another analyst said it "is a good move because RJR has
nothing to lose here. It's a technological advancement and
that puts them on the leading edge. But, if it doesn't fly

they have really not invested that much.
