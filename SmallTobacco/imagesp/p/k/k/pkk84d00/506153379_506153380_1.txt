When the media asked if Horrigan told one analyst if he had
the press conference because of SEC concerns over the stock
vise or because of competitive pressure, the analysts said

â€œof course not. The meeting was held to update as on a very

significant technological advance."

I heard no absolute negatives from analysts. On the other
hand, no analysts were widly enthusiatic. On balance, they

were excellent with the media and reflected positively about

RJR and the arrangement.
