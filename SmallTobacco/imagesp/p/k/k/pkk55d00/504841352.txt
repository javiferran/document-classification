COMMENTS OF THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE ON THE POLICY ANALYSIS
BOOK ON "ECONOMIC COSTS" OF SMOKING

As a self-admitted antismoking document, the book is
unimpressive, Apparently it is intended by its initiator
and financial sponsor, Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, as a

marketing tool for its stop-smoking gum, Nicorette.

It will be interesting to see the rebuttals to its thesis
by others in the antismoking movement who claim the excess
cost argument has no merit because smokersâ€™ lives are shorter

and their health care expenses are actually no greater.

We will sit out this argument, though we must wonder why the
authors fail to examine the costs nonsmokers must obviously
incur over their lifetimes as a basis for comparison. Obviously,
not smoking does not guarantee either a disease-free life

or immortality. Nonsmokers have the same chronic illnesses
which are discussed in the book, and many smokers never develop

then.

Overall, we are not impressed with the book.
