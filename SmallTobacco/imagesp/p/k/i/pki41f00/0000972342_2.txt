Incremental levels of lactic acid, from 0.25% to 2.50%, on the un-
mentholated KOOL were evaluated by modified WOODROSE techniques within
R&D (see attached graph). The encouraging results of impact reduction
using up to 2.0% acid, need confirmation by the formal WOODROSE panel
on factory-made cigarettes.

The advantages of using either the Southampton series or our own type

are many, including cost, availability, greater uniformity of the standards
within the series and more reproducibility from batch to batch. Further,
the establishment of a more objective scaling of standards seems more
desirable than a rather arbitrary assigning of scale ratings to market~-
place products. However, Southampton'’s series is based on varying ratios
of two tobacco types, beth flue-cured. For the U. S. market, I find our
approach, using a cased tobacce blend, more attract

 

Factory samples will be made containing incremental levels of lactic
acid. The WOODROSE evaluation, together with other analytical data
(such as free nicotine delivery) can then be used to determine the
best method for afsigning stendard ratings. For example, should a
scale be adopted based on multiple levels of additive or should the
Southampton method, based on j.n.d. between scale units, be adopted?
