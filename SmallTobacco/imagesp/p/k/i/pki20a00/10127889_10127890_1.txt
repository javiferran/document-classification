He confirmed that benzopyrenes are bound to low-density
lipoproteins and that the uptake of benzopyrene is not
dependent on its concentration. Of greater importance
for the uptake is the binding to low-density lipoproteins,
primarily dy endocytosis. So far everything is simple,
but one looks in vain after the rather extensive intro-
duction for a discussion of the other aims and goals of
this work which is mentioned in the introduction, namely
the relationship of these findings to atherosclerosis.
Most of the work is carried out on lymphocytes and not on
endothelial cells.

CRITIQUE:

Dr. Busbee is an enthusiastic investigator who works in an
important and interesting field, that of transport and
uptake of carcinogens. This, in itself, would give him a
rather high priority. One wonders, however, on the negative
side, how much if really new in this application. The
literature in this field is quite extensive and transport

of BP has been demonstrated in previous publication fron

the laboratories,

If he were to restrict himself to further expansion of this
work, I would give this application a rather high priority.
The reason I am holding back a bit is that much of this

seems to have already been accowplished. Although the field
is of considerable importance and has been somewhat neglected
in the past, I would have liked to see some further expansion
or at least plans for expansion,

As the project is now presented, I would give it a rather

slightly better than average priority, a B+ for scientific
merit and a B- for relevance,
