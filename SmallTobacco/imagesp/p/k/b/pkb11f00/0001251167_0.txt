SUMMARY

‘The paper recons from Marlboro KS and Marlboro Menthol Lights 100‘s
were found to be different. The paper recon from Marlboro KS
contained DAP and therefore exhibited the sugar-ammonia products. The
Marlboro Menthol Lights 100's paper recon did not contain phosphate in
excess of the level typically found in PJS where no DAP was added.
Therefore, the levels of the sugar-asmonia Progucts were much lower
(80-852) in the paper recon from Marlboro Menthol Lights 100‘s.

Tt has not been proven, but the furnish for the two paper recon are
also thought to be different. The furnish for the paper recon found
in Marlboro KS was thought to be heavily skewed towarg burley while,
the furnish for the Marlboro Menthol Lights 100’s was thought to be
skewed toward Elue-cured furnish.

A comparison of the paper and dark recons from Marlboro KU were also
made. This comparison showed that paper recon exhibited most of the
sugar-amponia reaction products found in the dark recon and in about
the eame quantities. The major differences were found in the wlatile
alkyl pyrazines region of the P&T profiles.

> INTRODUCTION

Bob Jobnaon bad isolated the paper recon from Marlboro KS and Marlboro

Wenthol Lights 100's. These materials, along with the dark recon from 8
Marlboro KS, were examined by purge-and-trap (P&T) and direct

silylation (DS) GC-MS. The combination of both of these analyses

showed the volatiles from the alkylpyrazines to deoxyfructosazine and »
fructosazines, Data from both of the analyses were used to reach the
conclusions drawn in this file note.
