Black Teeti-Agers Are Turning Away
From Smoking, but Whites Puff On

 

By PHILIP J. HILTS

ASHINGTON, April 18
- African-American
teen-agers have large-
ly eliminated smoking

from their lives, while white teen-
agers are still taking up the habit at
high rates, according to a study re-
ported in The Journal of the National
Cancer Institute.

 

“This is the singte most interest-

ing change in the use of tobacco in
years: the success of black teens,”
said Dr. Michael Eriksen, chief of
the Office on Smoking and Health at
. the Federal Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention in Atlanta.
“We'd like to bottle it and get it to

others, but we haven't figured out

how to do that yet.”

The trend is striking:

In 1976, Federal surveys of thou-
sands of high school seniors around
the country showed that both black
and white teen-agers smoked at rela-
tively high rates: 28.8 percent of
whites smoked one or more ciga-

rettes a day in the 30 days before the’

interviews, while 26.8 percent of
black teen-agers did so.

But by 1993, only 4.4 percent of
black teen-agers took up regular
smoking, according to the Institute
for Social Research at the Universi-
ty of Michigan, which conducts the

annual surveys for the Government. |

Among whites, the figures remains
high, at 229 percent in 1993, the
highest it has been since the late
1970's.

According to an article being pub-
lished on Wednesday in cancer insti-
tute journal, the change is not be-
cause of higher cigarette prices or
because the teen-agers are using
other drugs, but iste to a change in
attitude and social norms, said Dr.
Sherry Mills, an epidemiologist who
conducted group discussions with
two dozen white and black teen-
agers in each of five cities to deter-
mine what was behind the trend. The
focus groups met in Los Angeies,
Washington, New Orleans, Kansas

Dr. Mills wrote in the jaurnai that
family and community pressures
were persuading young African-
Americans not to smoke. For exam-
ple, there is a belief that. cigarerte
makers are targeting blacks. Refus-
ing tc smoke is part of the reaction.
Black parents are firm in telling
their children nor to smoke, and
black teen-agers have aiso changed
their idea of a good time, Dr. Mills
said.

- “Whereas black kids will go to a
party to dance and mingle, white
kids definitely will go — and this is
their self-reporting — to drink beer
and smoke cigarettes. Black kids
just don’t see that as fun.”

agency said: ‘We have ‘looked at
many possible explanations for it. It

is not a function of school perform-

he said, when the groups were com-
pared, the rate of regular smoking

was was two to three times as high -

among white teen-agers as among
black teen-agers. .
“For example, among dropouts,

the whites are two to three times.

sen. .
He explained: “Blacks seem to be

. turning off the message from ciga-

rette companies that smoking is
cool. For blacks, it no longer pro-
vides that function. You hear black
teens saying smoking’s a white
thing.”

He noted that white rock groups
and performers like Brad Pitt, Wino-
na Ryder and Johnny Depp, contin-
ued to glamorize smoking, while
biack performers did not.

“Over ail, we are very depressed
about teen smoking because we have
made no progress over the last 10
years,” he said. “The only bright
spot is the black teens. It shows us
that we shouldn't be satisfied with
more than 20 percent of teens smok-
ing. A significant portion of the popu-
lation has already got it under 5
percent.” . :
