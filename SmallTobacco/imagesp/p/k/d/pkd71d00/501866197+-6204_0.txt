REMARKS ON BRONCHIAL CARCINOMA
by
W, Denk

‘

During the last years there have been many papers on lung cancer, It is therefore,
unnecessary to review here consequently this very timely disease, In the following,
we shall discuss a few aspects of the total problem and report a few observations
which we have been able to make with the many patients of our Clinic.

There seems to be no question that the absolute number of bronchial cercinomata
has increased, This can be further proved by a few figures, ,

Gesell reports from Switzerland that the totel mortality from cancer has almost
doubled (1.8:1) from 1904 to 1948, while the mortality from lung cancer has ine
creased in the same period 20,7 times, In the United States in 1920, 1.1% of
all deaths due to cancer were due to a bronchial carcinoma, while in 1948 the
figure was already 8.3%,

The figures for the population of the city of Vienna have been put at our dis-
posal by the Central Statistical Office of the city, Total deaths due to cancer
have increased from 1931 to 1938 (21 city districts) 15.3%, and from 1939 to
1951 (26 city districts), they have increased by 16.7%, The deaths from
carcinoma of the respiratory system in men were 15.8% of all cancer deaths in
1931, 20.6% in 1938, and 31.76% in 1951,

For men and women together, the percentage of deaths from cancer of the respira-
tory system as a percentage of the total mortality from cancer was 6.66% in 1931,
11.92% in 1938, and 17,94 in 1951, The total mortality of the population of the
City of Vienna due to cancer has increased by one sixth during the last twenty
years; the mortality from cancer of the respiratory system has doubled,

In 1934, 440 people died per each 100,000 inhabitants of the City of Vienna due
to cancer of the respiratory system; for 1939, the figure wis 584, and for. 1951,
1,014. These figures likewise prove that there was a mch greater increase in
deaths due to lung cancer when referred to the total mortality due t. cancer.

These conclusions, however, are somewhat limited by the fact that the mortality
statistics do not give’as clear a picture as a morbidity statistic, which does
not exist in Austria, It is certain that presently a greater number of other
carcinomata than those of the lung are cured, and those naturally are not in-
cluded in a mortality statistic for cancer. This arguement against the mortality
statistics nevertheless, does not alter the fact of the absolute increase. How-
ever, we shall not discuss these theories in detail, Here we shall discuss only
the effects of cigarette smoking on bronchial carcinoma, since these relations
are ar great timeliness. We shall discuss this on the basis of patients in our
Clinic,
