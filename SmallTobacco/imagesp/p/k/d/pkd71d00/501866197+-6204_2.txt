It is very significant that 30 of the 42 women were nonsmokers, However, only 4
of the nonsmokers had adeno~carcinoma, We also found among the nonsmoking women,
2 squamous-epithelial, 3 solid, 4 polymorphic-cellular, 3 large cellwlar, and 1
small cellular carcinoma. Even though these figures are small, they cannot be
completely neglected. Their significance increases if one compares the cigarette
consumption in Austria with the extremely large increase of bronchial carcinoma
in our country,

The Austria Tabakwerke have been kind enough to put the figures on cigarette
sales in Austria from 1923 to 1951 at my disposal. These figures include the ~
officially imported cigarettes. Black-market cigarettes which add up to a
significant number only after 1945, have no effect on carcinogenesis because
of the limited time, since all authors agree that only after 20 to 30 years
does tobacco have any carcinogenic effect. Figure 1 shows the conswoption of
cigarette tobacco in grams per year, per head of population,

These figurés show that in Austria the consumption of tobanco during the years
which are critical from the point of view of carcinogenesin (effect during
twenty to thirty years) did at first only rise a little, however, then did de-
crease considerably, For certain reasons there was from 1931 to 1938 a very .
active propaganda campaign in favor of nonsmoking, The effect of this campaign
is clearly seen in the declining consumption. The increase during the last
years is without significance from the point of view of carcinogenesis.
