The effecta seem to indicate the carcinogenic effect of cigarette smoking, es-
pecially when the smoke is inhaled, Some authors point to the almost parallel
curves showing the increase of cigarette consumption and of bronchial carcinomate,

In Switzerland, the consumption of cigarettes has increased 11 times from 1924

to 1946 (Gesell). In the United States, the cigarette production (not counting
export cigarettes) has increased per year and per head of population from 46.3

cigarettes in'1903 to 2,542 in 1948 (Ochsner and collaborators). This increase
4n tobacco consumption runs parallel to the increase in lung cancer.

On the other hand, it is significant that for example in Iceland where untt1 1939
very few cigarettes vere used, cancer of the lung is reletivel; rere, even tolay.
Only 2.9% of all cancers are bronchial carcinomata, while in othex countries the
proportion is 10 to 20%,

The opinions are divided as to a causal relationship, Frey, 95% of whose patients
with lung cancer were heavy smokers, does not deny this releticnship. Acccrding
to Gesell, a significant correlation between the excessive use of tovecco and
bronchial carcinoma is proven. 87.3% of his patients were heavy omchera, 2.1%
non smokers, Similarly, Wynder and E, A. Graham come to the conclusion that
heavy smoking during long periods of time (20 to 30 years), especially cigarette
snoking, seems to be an important factor in the genesis of bronchial carcinoma;
they base these conclusions on detailed investigations, Of 605 men with lung
cancer, 96,5% were moderately heavy smokers to chain smokers; 94.1% of these
were cigarette smokers, while only 3,5% to 4% were cigar or pipe smokers. Es-
pecially squamous epithelial carcinoma seems to be caused by heavy smoking

while there was no way of finding a relationship between adeno-carcinoma and
tobacco consumption.

Several authors have tried to use the percentage of smokers in men free from
cancer to prove the carcinogenic effect of tobacco. In effect, the proportion
of heavy and very heavy swokers in men free from cancer has been found to be
much less (13.5% to 19.1%) according to Wynder and Graham, Levin and Goldstein,

We have questioned 757 of a total number of 1,145 patients with lung cancer on
their smoking habits, The results are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Nonsmokers 10.8%
Light smokers (up to 10
cigarettes per day) 30.0%
Moderately heavy smokere
(up to 20 cig, per day) 30.8%
Heavy smokers (more than
20 cigarettes per day) 28.48

(Own patients: 757 with Cancer Bronchi)

This tabulation shows, contrary to some other papers, a significantly low per-
centage of heavy smokers, while the proportion of nonsmokers and light smokers
