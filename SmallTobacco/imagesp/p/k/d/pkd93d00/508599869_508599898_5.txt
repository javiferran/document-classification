_ Working standards of 50,100,300,500,
1000 and 2000ug we were prepared from the
stock. /

A multipoint calibration was obtained using the above working standards.
With the appropriate muitiplicative normalization factors for sample
dilutions, results were obtained directly in yg/time segment/ cigarette.

RADIOISOTOPE LABELLING TECHNIQUE
I. Injection of 14C-Nicotine

Selected cigarettes were uniformly injected with 10u1 of
nicotine-(pyrrolidine-2-14C) obtained from AMERSHAM Corporation at 98%

_ purity. An aliquot was diluted with methanol to achieve a concentration of
12.15 wCi/ml. Cigarettes were injected into the center core over a 55mm
range starting at 3mm from the filter and ending at 5mm from the tobacco
end using a 10 ul Hamilton syringe with 3-inch capillary needle (#701).

II. Determination of 14C-Nicotine Distribution in Cigarette

Injection homogeneity of 14C-nicotine was determined by measuring the
length of tobacco rod consumed during puffing and smolder. Under FTC
conditions it was determined that llmm of the tobacco rod was consumed
during lighting -6mm for each of 9 puffs and smolder. Accordingly, a.
14C-nicotine labelled cigarette was dissected from the tobacco end into one
1lmm and nine 6mm segments. The filter was disected. into two 10mm
segments.The tobacco segments were mixed with cellulose powder to obtain a
total sample size not exceeding 1.3mg. These mixtures were oxidized with a
Hewlett Packard 306 Oxidizer. The resulting C02 was trapped in a 48% —
mixture of Carb-sorb in Peramfluor. The two filter segments were extracted :
with 10m] methanol. A 2ml aliquot of the resulting extract was then mixed
with Scinti-Verse II. All resulting solutions were radioassayed with a
Beckman Scintillation Counter LS 7800. Table 18 represents an average
distribution of 14C-nicotine in three cigarettes.
