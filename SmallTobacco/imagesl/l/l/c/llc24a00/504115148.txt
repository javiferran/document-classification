’ RE: List of additional references on environmental ci tte smoke -
Follow-up

Gentlemen:

Following up my memorandum and attachments to you of August 14th.
I have just received a print-out on the chemistry of sidestream cigarette
smoke, which I requested on August 8th. by telephone from the Office of
Smoking and Health. All the references in the substantive print-out re-
ceived from the Office of Smoking and Health pertain to the subject.

I am enclosing further references which were neither in Murray's
nor in my additional listing, which fall within the restrictive definitions
given in the 4th. paragraph of my August 14th. memorandum ("neither Murray
nor I",etc. ....). Copies of the full print-out f the Office of Smoking

and Health are available upon request. ;

;

Sincerely ;
