Introduction  Almost all higher animals require dietary methionine for growth, although this need can generally be met by its metabolic precursor homo- cysieine in the form of homocystine (1). A similar situauion has been found for Primary cultures of normal mammahan cells where either methionine or a mixture including homocysteine, vitamin B-12, and folic acid is required for growth. However, in virally transformed or in cancer cell lines, cells often lose the ability to proliferate in methionine- deficient, homocysteine-containing medium (Met '-Hcy*) and become dependent upon methi- onine for growth (for a review, see Ref. 2).

It has been clearly shown that methionine-de- pendent cells synthesize targe amounts of intracel- lular methionine from homocysteine and 5- methyl-tetrahydrofolate (3,4). Methionine is used not only for protein synthesis but for the ATP-de- pendent synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine. This Product is used as a methyl group donor in a wide variety of transmethylation reactions. as a pro- pylamine donor in polyamine synthesis, and as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cysteine [5,6].

__label__5 MEMORANDUM January 19, 1976  TO: Mr. J. R. Ave FROM: A. B.. Hudson  SUBJECT: Kent Golden Light Menthol  Based on the information I have obtained’, the extra- polated sales off KGL on an annualized, national basis will be approximately five (5) billion units. It would appear that an unusually good. opportunity to increase the sales impact of this brand will be missed if we do not introduce a KGL Menthol..  The supportive data for this opinion is shown in Tables land 2. These tables list the availllable sales data for brands. that have been introduced since 1966 with a companion menthol. Table 1. shows the sales of competitive products. as reported by Maxwell and Table 2 lists the sales of Lorillard products as reported by Maxwell, except where noted.  As can be seen, the average percent of sales of the menthol products: relative to the non-menthol for the com- petitive brands is 54%, andi for the Lorillard brands 57.6%. Assuming this data would translate if a KGL Menthol was introduced, the anticipated sales of the menthol brand would be approximately two to three billiion units during the first year of introduction.  In evaluating the data shown in the Tables, it should be remembered that one of the most accepted methods: of fore- casting sales trends isi a technique called "exponential smoothing". This simply means: that the most recent data is given the most weight in the forecast. Because off this, any data for brands: introduced before 1966 would be superfluous for this type of forecasting. It can also be seen that if only the brands: which have been introduced recently are considered, then the percent of menthol sales relative to the non-menthol would be greater than 603.  Ta2c0S08

Additionally, the prevalence of current smo! ing de- clined to 11.8 percent in 1996 from 16.3 percent in 1987.  The results of the telephone sur- vey of 187,302 women aged 18 to 44 from 33 states appear in today’s issue of the Journal of the Ameri- van Medici sociation.  ‘The researchers, led by Dr. Sha- hul Ebrahim, said women who re- ported they were pregnant were about half as likely to be current smokers as women who weren't pregnant — a ratio that fluctuated only slightly over the 10-year sur- vey period.  In 1987, 16.7 percent of the preg- nant women reported being smok- ! ers and 26.7 percent of the women | who weren't pregnant said they °  smoked. By 1996, only 11-8 percent of the pregnant women smoked  and only 23.6 of women who,  weren't pregnant did.  “In this analysis, the decline in smoking over ime among pregnant women was primarily due to the overall decline in soioking initia~ tion. rates among women of child- bearing age, not to an increased rate of smoking cessation related to pregnancy," the researchers wrote.  ‘The researchers cautioned that because the survey had excluded women without telephones, women younger than 18 and these who did not live in private residences, they may have underestimated the actu- al prevalence of smoking.

__label__6 Two Indoor Air Quality Investigations -- Oceans Apart  Simon Turner Healthy Buildings International Inc. (HBI) 10378 Democracy Lane Fairfax, Virginia 22030 U.S.A.  INTRODUCTION  A commonly seen method of indoor air evaluations in buildings perceived as “sick" involves an engineering study of a building in conjunction with a questionnaire administered to its occupants. As a result we now have evidence that tighter, air conditioned buildings generate higher incidence of upper respiratory complaints than naturally ventilated buildings.':? However, this combination of engineering evaluation and occupant questionnaire as a diagnostic method for sick buildings has not provided us with the ability to predict the cause of indoor air problems from occupant symptoms.  One major reason for this appears to be that many common irritants found in indoor air result in a similar range of upper respiratory symptoms. Many diagnosed “sick" buildings are reported to have their causes rooted in ventilation, filtration or hygiene problems which allow a mixture of low level pollutants to build up 2-4 These irritate occupants in a complex and possibly synergistic manner, the mechanism of which is largely unknown to us.  To demonstrate the range of engineering characteristics which can produce similar complaints of sick building syndrome, this paper presents two case histories of identically sized buildings, the studies of which were completed in July of 1989. One of these buildings (designated as Building A) was located in Washington D.C., and the other (designated as Building 3) was located in San Diego, California. Both buildings are 600,000 square feet in size and a full description of their respective characteristics is found in the results section.  Symptomology  The following symptoms were reported in Building A during the year previous to this study: sneezing and/or coughing; sinus congestion; dry nasal passages; post nasal drip; rashes amd dry skin; headache; breathing difficulties; sore throat; drowsiness; fatigue; eye irritation. In Building 5 the following complaints were noted over the same period of time: odors; headaches; shortness of breath; eye irritation; dizziness. These symptoms in both buildings compare well with the classic symptomology of the sick building syndrome as defined in the Commission of the European Communities Report -- Sick Building Syndrome, A Practical Guide) which lists the symptoms as follows: nasal irritation with nasal stuffiness; dryness and irritation of the mucous membrane of the eye; dryness and irritation of the throat; skin dryness and irritation; headaches, generalized lethargy and tiredness.

__label__6 WINSTON, NASCAR HAVE GROWN TOGETHER  The 1995 season marks the 25th year of involvement in NASCAR for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and its flagship Winston brand. For a quarter of a century, NASCAR and Winston have joined to form one of the most successful marketing ventures in the history of sports sponsorships.  Since RJR and Winston began sponsoring the Winston Cup Series in 1971, the growth of NASCAR racing has been nothing short of sensational.  "We are very excited to be celebrating our Silver Anniversary in NASCAR Winston Cup racing," says T. Wayne Robertson, the president of RJR's Sports Marketing Enterprises. "We believe this program to be one of the finest in any marketing campaign, and we're very proud of the contributions we have been able to make to the sport,” Robertson says. "We thank the competitors for their acceptance of our role in racing and the fans for their continued support of our products."  During those 25 years, the level of competition has skyrocketed. Only a handful of teams were capable of victory during NASCAR's formative years. Today, almost any driver in the field has what it takes to find victory in NASCAR Winston Cup racing.  In 1971, Winston established the first point fund for competitors — $100,000. Richard Petty claimed the champion's $40,000 portion at the Plaza Hotel in Daytona Beach, Fla.  The Winston Cup point fund has grown by leaps and bounds in the 25 seasons hence. At the 1995 NASCAR Winston Cup Awards banquet in the Grand Ballroom of the storied Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, Winston will distribute $3.5 million — a $500,000 increase over 1994 — to 25 drivers and teams. The substantial increase shows how dedicated Winston is to the great sport of NASCAR Winston Cup racing.  Since its involvement began, Winston has pumped more than $50 million into competitors’ bank accounts — through point funds, special competitions and individual races sponsored by Reynolds Tobacco.  From the 1995 point fund, $1.3 million will go to the Winston Cup champion. For the past two seasons, that champion has been Dale Eamhardt. "The Intimidator," as he is known to many, tied the great Richard Petty's mark last year by claiming his seventh Winston Cup title, a mark many thought never would be equaled. Eamhardt never has won three straight Winston Cup championships, an accomplishment he will be seeking this season.  If a competition can be judged by its champions, Petty's and Eamhardt's presence at the top of the list speaks volumes for Winston Cup racing.  The 1995 season marks the debut of the Winston Select Bonus Program. Through this $200,000 competition, a driver will receive $100,000 for leading the Winston Cup points standings following the Winston Select 500 at Talladega, Ala., in April and $100,000 for leading the standings following the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis in August.  z9e¢ SO9TS

DOUG SIMPSON  SUBJECT: Funding For Air Purification Device Development, Prototype Construction, and Testing  Assisting in the Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) investigation for Fundamental Research and Development Department at Bowman Gray Technical Center (BCTC), we have designed subject device. Development and testing of this device has the potential of reducing the impact of “ETS” in public buildings particularly food service and entertainment establishments.  We are requesting a grant of $4500 to accomplish subject work. To the best of our knowlewdge at this time these funds will cover the cost of engineering, materials and labor required to fabricate a prototype and testing to develop effectiveness data for this device.  Legal council at BGTC is presently investigating patentability of subject device. A decision should be reached by mid November on this matter.  If this funding is granted and we are advised to proceed with this work the prototype can be constructed and ready for testing by January 1, 1988.  Please advise as to how we can further assist you in this matter.      Richard P. Lortie, P. &.  RPL: gws (33 76v)  Copy to: Je: Cc. Henderson Cc. W. Nystrom  4 L76T CbPTS

__label__5 To:  From:  Date:  Lu TOBAGCO COMPANY  MEMORANDUM  Mr. Randy Spell MLL. Orlowsky  March 8, 2000.  Subject: Various - MPID  A few suggestions regarding various pieces of information to be considered for inclusion in MPID reports:  Az  Minor Mannfacturers/Brand Report  Too much emphasis is placed on share of market analysis {see report dated 3/6), and not enough on providing volume data, Percentage gains/losses of share is really not very relevant as opposed to this comparison based on volume. The report should include additional information related to volumes, i-e., annual shipments for 1998 and 1999, year- to-date 2000, and an attempt to project annualized volumes for 2000, as well as percentage changes. This does not have to be developed to the division level, but could be helpful either on a regional or area basis. The report tends to dwell on what occurred in the past. This is good up to a point, however, some hypothesizing as to futures would be better. Since this report is based on Excei data, we should also consider similar additions to the MSA shipment analyses.  Pricing Comparisons  Some time ago, we discussed developing average pricing comparisons to establish a history as well as a current picture of the percentage differentials between the various price segments of the matket. What is the status of this information?  Given the growing importance of minor brands, we shonid include, wherever possible, a compicte view of the market by including the minors along with the majors. I am not certain of the availability of the minor sales data. A review should be made te determine what is available and how this information can be included as part of the on-going analyses.  8S8rFISS

No-one should underplay the difficulties of switching and then sticking 10 2 dict an wiuch tat accounss for +39% of roral energy intake-—the WHO Expert Committee's Suggested definiion of “moderation”. Such changes have undoubtedly been achieved in some groups under regular surveillance over short pe- nods, but long-term dietary compliance in the mul- uple risk factor intervention trial may have been less than intended and an earher American study also ran into trouble because of poor compliance (11). These difficulties are much better acknow!- edged and grappled with than swept under the car- pet. The possibility, at least, that moderate alcohol consumption reduces the risk of IHD is one that poses obvious difficulties, but there is no point in pretending that it docs not exist.  Thirdly, what are the advantages and disadvan. tages of making recommendations about healthy living in general rather than about IHD in partic- ular? It is a far bet that losing weight 15 a more immediate personal goal for most prople, including middie-aged meh, than avoiding THD. A reduction in fat intake (along with the pursuit of physical activity) is common to both purposes and it seems short-sighted not to make the most of the particu. larly strong motivation towards weight control, difficult though even this is to capitalize upon.  Finally, the debate must certainly proceed with- Our secrecy or intripue. In its issue of 3 July 1983, the Sundar Times laid bare a series of events within the Department of Health's advisory machinery which, even if they were only half trae, would be deplorable. In 1979, the Government set up a National Advisory Committee on Nutrition Educa- tion. A subcommittee was appointed to recom- mend nutritional guidelines for health education in Britain many of which are, of course, concerned with IHD. Besides making specific roposals, the report *pparently recognized the difficulties the food industry would face and consequently sug. gested a prolonged time-scale over which changes could be made. By all accounts, the subcommittee’s report was well received by the parent committee. However, the industry apparently dishked much of what it read and seems to have pot the Deparment TO suppress of at any rate delay the report.?

Kaplan  — Risk factor intervention does work  Professor Oliver uses data from the US multiple risk factor intervention trial as evidence for his argue ment that mass interventions to reduce risk factors have not worked and ought to be given up.  The data from this trial, in fact, show just the opposite (7). The rates of coronary mortality were much reduced in both groups, the half given special interventions and the half returned to their usual sources of medical cate. The desipners of the study assumed that the risk factors among the “usual care"’ group would change very little, preserving the statistical likelihood thar 187 coronary deaths would occur among them. They calculated that a much greater reduction in isk factors among the “special interventions” group would reduce their projected number of coronary deaths to 137, thus providing a 27% difference that would be statisti- cally significant.  What then happened proved that risk factor intervention does work, contrary to Oliver's inter: pretation.

(2) Review and observe the operation of the forced-air curing system installed in selected flue-cured tobacco barns.  (3) Review other field tests and production programs.  SUMMARY:  In November, 1985, a virus-like disease of tobacco was observed that has the potential of threatening much of the Brazilian crop. Dr. Guy Gooding, NCSU phytopathologist and virus expert, agreed to conduct an on-site investigation of the disease. His observations, on-site antigen-antibody reactions, and subsequent laboratory tests demonstrated conclusively that the disease is caused by the tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV).  The operation of several experimental forced-air curing systems, designed by Mr. Mike Bernard, and installed in flue-cured tobacco barns, was observed. In all cases, tobacco cured in the modified barns, as compared to that of conventional barns, exhibited a significantly deeper-orange color and a sweeter aroma.  Most field investigation plots were beginning to suffer from the lack of rain; however, they will still produce valuable data. Most tests were set to the field early and are currently being harvested.  KEYWORDS:  Brazil, Curing, Disease, Seed, Flue-Cured Tobacco, Irrigation, Tomato Spotted Wilt, Varieties, Virus  STATUS:  This is an ongoing project. Future recommendations and research proposals are primarily contingent upon the results of the current experiments.  -l-  wy  Project No.: 0600 - International Projects CONFIDENT,"!            27t Gu  Sind 2LS0sS

Dear Sirs  At the present time I am engaged in the Maytag Research Project at the Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque. The research, which is carried out under strict medical supervision, is designed to relate some 110 events with pulmonary function data of unselected, healthy and diseased individuals, The data are correlated with subsequent yearly testing on these patients, =  From past work on animals and humans it has been found that those individuals with lung disease and/or cancer frequently differ from the norm by the presence of an atyoical protein moiety. The failure to establish a specific protein in every case is principally due, I be- lieve, to the lack of refined technique; for it appears that patients with bronchospastic syndromes have a definite biochemical predtléction to these conditions; and this factor may well be a protein. If one were able, through refinement of existing methods, to obtain statis= tical evidence for the existence of such a diagnostic protein and dem onstrate that these individuals having it show abnormal findings in the battery of tests from the Maytag Project, it would appear thatthe alleged carcinogenic and irritative effects of tobacco may be purely coincidental and not etiological,  anal ony  Thinking a subject such as this would be of great interest to You, I should like to apply to you for a grant to conduct a research program to test my thesis, The best technique for such a project is starch- gel-electrophoresis, The obvious advantage of this zonal method over the free-boundary one is that the former affords easy isolation of the protein substance, whereas this is impossible in the latter case, Mores over, of the two types of zonal analysis » the starch-gel method offers better resolution than the paer technique, “  Inasmich as the Maytag Project data are rapidly growing, and the need for an additional program such as I have described is increasing, a prompt reply would be appreciated, ‘  Thank you for your attention to this matter.

__label__2 Role of myosin light-chain phosphorylation in endothelial  cell retraction  REBECCA SHELDON, ALAN MOY, KATHY LINDSLEY, SANDRA SHASBY, AND D. MICHAEL SHASBY Department of Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine and the Veterans Administration Hospital, Iowa City, lowa 52242  Sheldon, Rebecca, Alan Moy, Kathy Lindsley, Sandra Shasby, and D. Michael Shasby. Role of myosin light-chain phosphorylation in endothelial cell retraction. Am. J, Physiol. 265 (Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 9): L606-L612, 1993.— Endothelial cells retract centripetally when they are exposed to histamine and when extracellular calcium is chelated. This cen- tripetal retraction implies that a centripetal tension must be expressed in the cells. We asked whether phosphorylation of the light chain of myosin (MLC) was important for the retraction to occur, and, by inference, expression of the tension. In human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells and in porcine pulmo- nary artery endothelial (PPAE) cells tryptic peptide maps in- dicated that MLC was phosphorylated by myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK). Activity of MLCK is inhibited by ML-9, a kinase inhibitor with relative specificity for MLCK, and when MLCK is phosphorylated by the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic mono- phosphate (cAMP)-dependent kinase. Pretreatment of HUVE cells or PPAE cells with ML-9 or forskolin-aminophylline (to increase cell cAMP) reduced basal MLC phosphorylation and prevented an expected increase in MLC phosphorylation fol- lowing exposure of HUVE cells to histamine. Pretreatment of HUVE cells with MU-9 or forskolin-aminophylline prevented HUVE cell retraction (measured as an increase in permeability of a monolayer of HUVE cells) in response to histamine. Pre- treatment of PPAE cells with ML-9 or forskolin-aminophylline prevented PPAE cell retraction in response to chelation of ex- tracellular calcium. These data support the hypothesis that phosphorylation of MLC is an important component of endo- thelial cell retraction.  tension; substrate adherence; calcium  INFLAMMATORY EDEMA is associated with separation of adjacent endothelial cells (2, 4, 15, 17, 19, 24, 25, 28). Although there are multiple reports documenting this, the mechanism of cell separation is not well explained.  Agents that chelate calcium and interrupt calcium- dependent cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion cause edema and separation of adjacent endothelial cells (19, 25). These observations suggest that separation may re- sult from loss of tethering between cells and between cells and substrate. They also imply that a constitutive centripetal tension opposes the tethering, and unop- posed expression of this constitutive tension contributes to cell retraction when the tethering is released.  Other investigators have suggested that the separa- tion of adjacent endothelial cells involves initiation or augmentatios of a centripetal tension that is mediated by actin and myosin (22, 29). This position is based on the observation that 100 uM calcium, ATP, myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), and calmodulin caused phosphorylation of the light chain of myosin (MLC) and contraction of the actin cytoskeleton of endothelial cells after their cell membranes were removed with detergents (22, 29, 30).  L606  We previously observed that histamine caused retrac-  - tion of human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells,  that this was prevented by pretreatment of the cells with agents that increased cell adenosine 3',5'-cyclic mono- phosphate (cAMP), and that the increased cAMP did not prevent histamine from increasing calcium in the HUVE cells (4). More recently we found that MLCK constitutively phosphorylates MLC in HUVE cells (0.21 + 0.02 mol phosphate/mol MLC), that histamine in- creases MLC phosphorylation (0.19 + 0.05 mol phosphate/mol MLC), and that cAMP reduces the con- stitutive level of phosphorylation (to 0.06 + 0.02 mol phosphate/mol MLC) and prevents the increase in phosphorylation expected after histamine exposure (18). Although these experiments were consistent with the idea that cAMP prevented the response to histamine by preventing MLC‘ phosphorylation, activation of the cAMP-dependent kinase could also have other effects on the cytoskeleton of the cells that might contribute to inhibition of retraction. In the experiments described in this paper we extend these observations by deter- mining the effects of inhibition of MLC phosphoryla- tion by two very different mechanisms on the retrac- tion of endothelial cells in response to an increase in centripetal tension (histamine) and to a loss of tether- ing (calcium chelation).

__label__6 Attachment II  Acceptable Daily Intake of Dicamba  A safe level or acceptable daily intake (ADI) of Dicamba has been calculated by RJRT as follows:  1. An average person weighs 60 kg (conservative).  2. This person consumed 60 cigarettes per day (99.4% of the U.S. population consumes 60 or less cigarettes/day) .-  3. The No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) in a one-year dog study is 1.25 mg/kg.  4. The NOEL (1.25 mg/kg) is used to calculate an ADI for humans.  e 1.25 mg/kg + 100 fold safety factor = 0.0125 mg/kg e 60 kg person x 0.0125 mg/kg = 0.75 mg/day  se 0.75 mg/day + 60 cigarettes per day = 0.0125 mg/cigarette  e 0.0125 mg/cig + 0.89 grams tobacco/cigarette = 0.0140 mg/gram  e 0.0140 mg Dicamba/gram tobacco = 14 ppm as the ADI for Dicamba  Hence, 14 ppm is an acceptable daily intake of Dicamba whether consumed orally or by inhalation. Even with this conservative estimate, this value is 28 times higher than the 0.5 ppm residue level for Dicamba on tobacco set by the USDA.  In the case of smoke, our studies show less than 5% of the Dicamba present in the cigarette is transferred into the mainstream smoke or to the environment. Therefore, if tobacco were the sole source of Dicamba, the leaf that is used to make cigarettes could contain up to 280 ppm Dicamba and still be within the acceptable daily intake level for Dicamba  (280 x 5% = 14 ppm).  66€E £2905

Warfield, S. A. Haut, C.. K. Keene, and W. R. Morgan  Subject: Current Theoretical Considerations on the: Origin of MS NNK from Water-Washed Fillers and Basewebs  Hot water washing (as in the RL process) results: in base webs (BWs): with greatly reduced MS NNN and NAT levels relative to: corresponding levels from feedstock, but MS NNK levels are not reduced! by this process." The same phenomenon occurs when: cut fliller is exhaustively washed with water at room temperature.” The MS NNK delivered by water-washed fillers and BWs: has been referred to as pyrosynthetic NNK. 7 ,     The pyrosynthetic formation off TSNA. in MS smoke has been studied for’ several years by Project 6908.° Although not included in official. documenta- tion previously, the most common hypothesis used to explain the failure of water extraction to remove the source of MS NNK was as follows: there is a water-insoluble amine precursor remaining in the extracted filler which reacts with a nitrosating agent, also derived from a water-insoluble source, LECEM ae to: form NNK. The water-insoluble amine precursor undergoes pyrolytic clea- vage,. either before or after nitrosation, and then the NNK transfers to MS. Alternatively, bound nicotine itself may be nitrosated during smoking. None of the above theories include any explanation of how or when. these MS NNK Precursors are formed.. As. a result of recent discussions in Project 6908, a new hypothesis has been advanced which encompasses. most of the previous theories as well. as. some new. ideas. The current hypothesis. is stated. below:  Some of the nicotine present in tobacco becomes bound before curing is complete. Part of the bound nicotine is oxidized to bound pseudooxynicotine (PsON) or a related NNK precursor, and at least'a portion of this bound precursor is nitrosated during curing to yield bound NNK, while a portion may remain in nitrosatable form. Water extraction does not remove ail bound NNK or the remaining bound NNK precursors.. NNK is released from the bound form and is also pyrosynthesized from bound NNK precursors (or from bound nicotine) during smoking, and the total NNK released partially transfers as MS NNK or is decomposed ‘during the smoking process.  eS2z.80Tecoe  In the remainder of this memo,. the derivation of the above: hypothesis is described, and! plans that have been. made to substantiate: these concepts are: briefly presented.

Now the tobacco industry's offering a new set of ads to television stations urging children not to smoke. The Tobacco Institute's spots calls for kids to talk to their parents before lighting up. There's also an 800 number you can call to get a free booklet on how to help your youngsters avoid the habit. (Graphic: Free Stop Smoking Booklet 1-800-342-9099 From The US Tobacco Institute)  However, the American Lung Association isn't impressed by the campaign. A spokesman called it a calculated campaign that makes smoking appear to be an adult habit.  Jane Rinka, co-anchor:  Which we know it’s not. Smoking is unfortunately one of the causes of health problems which keep the demand for medical professionals high.  # # #  TIMN 409443  Material supplied by VMS may onty be used for internal review, analysis or research.

Gannon  Japan Prototypes  While I have written nothing formally conerning telephone conversation in question, the attached memo from R. L. Snyder adequately summarizes the situation. While several people in Asia are copied, this fax  will arrive in time for your N.P.C. meeting whereas the actual copies  may not. Please note that we have not as yet resolved the question of testing  an 80 mm Marlboro prototype cited in R. Snyder's point two. Additionally, the timing for development and testing of prototypes  {last paragraph) appears unrealistic. Will look forward to receiving feedback on discussions of your  N.P.C. meeting.     W. F.
