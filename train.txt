__label__2 Cassette  recorders up 150%  Sales expected to hit $350 million in 1970; tape volume also soars  Time was when only a relatively few Americans owned tape Tre- corders. Most of them were the “hi- fi hobbyists. who were willing to put up with the need for threading tape from one reel to another... with the agony of watching tape come spilling out of the machinery in wild disarray because of some malfunction.  The dedicated hi-fi aficionados stil], for the most part, stay with their open-reel machines. But mil- lions of the more fumble-fingered public have come into the tape re- corder market, as a result of the ad- yent of the cassette—the self-con- tained unit in which tape moves from one reel to the other without need for the user ever to touch the reel or the tape.  So papular, so ubiquitous has the cassette recorder become that indus- try leaders estimate U. S. retail vol- ume will reach $350 million in 1970. This would represent an increase of more than 150% over 1969.  AMERICAN DRUGGIST'’S most re- cent big ticket survey indicated that more than 16,000 drug stores car- ried cassette recorders.  Nor is the business limited to the recording devices. A cassette re- corder is of no use without cassette tape—and sales of blank tape are expected to exceed $80 million this year.  While no one knows for sure— because the market is still in its for- mative stages—what percentage of the business is done by drug stores, guesses by those in the field vary from 151% to 17%.

__label__1 By GINA KOLATA     Y most objective meas- ures, Dr. Julie A. Swain is, like her twin sister, a stun- ning success.  She is the chief of cardiovascular surgery at the University of Nevada School of Medicine, a member of a Food and Drug Administration com- mittee that evaluates new devices, a member of an Agency for Health Care Policy committee that devel- ops medical practice guidelines and a member of the Defense Depart- ment’s peer-review committee for quality assurance.  A decade ago, when she was at Louisiana State University, she was the first woman to be chief of cardi- ac surgery at an American medical school. And, like her sister, she evokes effusive praise from col- leagues.  Blt Dr. Swain is bitter about her career. She, like her sister, wants to be the best, and the best, to her, is a position as chief of cardiology at a major medical center, something no woman has yet achieved. ‘‘I’m chief of cardiology at a very small medi- cal school,"’ she said.  Her failure to reach her goal is not for lack of hard work. Dr. Swain     ‘typically works from 6:30 in the  morning until 9 at night. She is di-. vorced and has no children, and she lives and breathes surgery.  And, apparently, it is not for tack of talent. Dr. Michael DeBakey, the eminent heart surgeon at Baylor University in Houston, said she “meets what I would regard as the highest requirements.”  Dr. Swain “is very industrious and very devoted to her career and very able,"" he added. ‘'! think she has the ability to succeed at the very top."  But Dr. Swain believes that the top positions are essentially closed to women. If advancement were just based on “hard work and how good you are, it would be wonderful,” she said. Women surgeons say itis much harder for them to get jobs, and when they do get positions as sur- geons, Dr. Swain added, they find it hard to get patients. She explained that surgeons are dependent on re- ferrals for patients, and many doc-     _ Twin Sees Herself Stymied      Dr. Julie A. Swain at the Universi- ty of Nevada School of Medicine.     tors will not send their patients to a female heart surgeon.  “There probably will be a woman President before there is a woman chief of surgery at a major medical school,’ she said.  Dr. Stephen E. Epstein, chief of cardiology at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethes- da, Md., who has worked with Dr. Swain, said she is an “excellent car- diac surgeon” and that “she did a superb job’’ at the heart institute. | But he agrees that heart surgery “is a very hard field to get into as a woman."  Dr. DeBakey was reluctant to say that a hostile climate toward women had kept Dr. Swain and other able women from the top ranks. There are few such positions and many talented surgeons, he said. ‘‘Some- times it's just related to what oppor- Cuniues are available,” he said. “Lady luck plays a role."  But Dr. Swain said that if she could live her life over again, she would steer clear of surgery. ‘I would probably do interventional cardiology,”” she said.

Also find included the response analysis chart.  The number of cartons produced for this offer was 1,745,000. The original response projection for this program was 11% and would have resulted in 16,000 coupon requests, or the submission of 192,000 cash pieces. Response to this program continues to be very good. As of October 22nd, we had received a total of 257,016 cash pieces from consumers, resulting in 21,418 free carton coupon requests. The response rate currently stands at 14.7%. Actual results have exceeded the original projection by a considerable amount.  Of the requests we received, 90% derived from the True filter packings and 10% from Menthol. Also of note, 36% of the respondents smoke 20 to 29 cigarettes per day. 27% of the respondents smoke over 40 cigarettes a day and 17% smoke from 30 to 39. 13% did not specify.  Also find enclosed the True Carton Cash Projected Response chart. This chart shows the original projection and the revised projection for this program and how they compare with the actual response. You will see that the actual response through October 224 (21,418) has already  surpassed the October projection (21,215).  Upon your review of these reports, please contact me with any questions or if additional information is required.  DK/bh  CC: G. Baroody A. Pasheluk G. Telford S. Benson J. Young 8S. Smith J.

December 1 - 4, 19869  Dear DOr. Hockett:  In my letter of July 15 I stated that the place for the meeting would be the Virgin Isle Hilton on St. Thomas. However, I have now been informed by the Hiller Travel Service that this hotel will not be able to receive our group, due ta other previously accepted arrangements. The travel agency instead suggest the Americana Hotel of San Juan on Puerta Riso. As far as I can see this place is in all respects comparable to  the Virgin Isie Hilton and I hope that this change of sites in no way will be inconvenient to you.  Yours sincerely,  Lars Friberg, M.D.  P.S.  I have got a letter from Or. J. Cornfield, where  he suggests that we invite Or. Manning Feinleib  of the National Heart Institute. He is engaged in  a detailed examination in Framingham of several hundreds of the VA pairs. I think this is a good idea and have sent him a letter of invitation.  We believe it is possible to include Dr. Feinleib in the group because of the fact that Mr. Enslein is not among the invited participants but is taking part as an observer from the Tobacco Research Council.  ce: Mr. Alexander Holtzman         SP-FILES 004518

Research-U. S.A. ‘Inc.  900 Third Avenue  New York, NY 10022. .  Dear pe ier  For each of the past six years, the University of Virginia Cancer Center has sponsored a Fall Symposium on a topic in basic cancer research.: Past topics have included: Molecular Biology of Human Cancer; Protein Phosphorylation; The Ras Superfamily; Viruses, Oncogenes and Cancer; Gene Regulation; and Signal Transduction. We wish to:thank you again for your financial contribution of last year that helped make the 1991 meeting a great success.. For this coming fall, we are organizing a symposium on Molecular Signalling and Cell Structure. Understanding the: molecular and structural basis for the transmission of regulatory information from membrane to nucleus-is among the central contemporary issues in molecular oncology and cell biology, and this symposium should  help to coalesce emerging ideas on the topic. a G e  Participants include Thomas Pollard Gis Hopkins), Thomas Stossel (Brigham and Women’s Hospital), Timothy Springer (Rockefeller University), Thomas Leto (NIFH), Colin Hopkins - (MRC, England ), and Inder Verma (Salk Institute).  The topics to be discussed range from studies on cell structure and growth factor receptors to the analysis of gene expression. We feel that this conference is particularly timely and will help - to focus on new ideas regarding cell-cell interactions, cell structure and cell signalling. Given the multi-disciplinary nature of the topic and the. outstanding quality of the scientific participants, we expect this symposium to be a major event in this rapidly developing field.  We are writing to ask your financial support for this symposium. Funds will be used to. partially offset the costs of travel and local expenses of the speakers. We would, of course. acknowledge your contributions in the program and in any advertisements for the Symposium which are prepared subsequent to receiving a commitment from you. In addition, if The Council for Tobacco Research scientists wish to attend the Symposium and engage in. discussions with the participants or if sales representatives from The Council for Tobacco Research would like to set tup a display at the Symposium, they would be made most welcome.  We look forward to hearing from you, and to your support fora stimulating meeting. : 7  Sincerely,          [fu p& uo Cerin Michael J. Weber. . J.

You are listed there as being an american Cancer Society Professor of Cellular and Developmental Biology and that is mentioned again. in the introduction (see enclosed). While the Society is very grateful for your using your American Cancer Society title in publications and public appearances and the like, it is not. appropriate, it seems to us, to have it listed with the Council for Tobacco Research. For our staff and volunteers this is a conflict of interest--that at least is the perception. These are the people that bring us products that Kill a half million Americans a year, and for the American Cancer Society to be in any way associated with the Council for Tobacco Research lends it credibility that is frankly embarrassing.  ~ ~  We certainly recognize that the members of the Scientific  Advisory Board are a distinguished group of people who are making sincere efforts on behalf of research.

Wrather, director of the tobac- co division of the U.S. Department of Agri-  ue culture’s marketing service, made. the point  ~ the other day that while other types. of farms — ‘are disappearing at a rapid rate, uprooting “families they once supported, tobacco farms:  “> have actually increased in number. This may  wo surprise some, but here are the figures:  “8 Nearly 3,000, 000 farms have disap- oa - peared since 1919, about 45 per cent of ‘. the total. In 1919 there were 6,500,000 US. farms. Last year there were only 3 800,000. ;  “+1 Tobacco farms meanwhile have reg: < "istered a gain of 21,000 in number since  1919—from 496, 000 that year to Slt  . 000 now.  nn “The decline in: “farms, Director ‘Wrather - . pointed out in his piece in TOBACCO NEWS, ’ has been steady except for a slight upturn - from 1928 to 1935, when the depression     ~- brought about a return to the land. After  that the downturn began at a heavier pace  .,. than ever as farmers moved to cities for '.<. jobs in business and industry.  _ Nearly all types of farms have been af- -" fected. Here are a few examples of the de- |  oo clines among farms. for the major cash crops,  _- from 1919 to 1959:  Corn farms dropped in number from 4,900,000 to 1,900,000. . Wheat farms declined from 2,200,- 000 to 931,000. Cotton farms are down from 1,900,- 000 to 499,540. '. Sugar beet farms dropped from. 47,- 0006 to 23,700. . Among the major cash crops, only soybean and. tobacco farms have shown an increase. .  We are glad the USDA man mentioned soybeans, which have come to be.a most im- portant crop in our own county and ‘section. The rise in soybean farms came with dis- covery of new product uses for the beans, — such as soybean. oils for food: products and  ' paints. We have never been able to find out — “+o if it is true or not, but we were told once -  “~ Upon a time that bugles, evefi, are made of | .

Mr. Wrather allowed that ',the movement away from the farm to the  mn technology and “better employment oppor-  "tunities in business and industry,” though it — “should be said that manv who quit the farm «and flock into the Big Town for job oppor-  "oo" tunity meet” disappointment ana someuiucs “he : frustration. :     tee “there was a drop of 4,000.000 or so from.  °1950 to 1958, as has been reported many’ “times. since, and commonly it is said that ‘.. mechanization, better seed and fertilizer and  ‘the drop in manpower needed in farming.  ; . dustry has required more manpower in years  7 chines, and if the signs do not deceive every- body, the role of the modern miracle machine  --< vesting. the situation is different from wheat,  “ does most of the work.

Still, while: personal attention is still the byword for the tobacco farmer, improved methods and equipment have enabled him to get bigger crop yields and a higher cash re- turn per acre.  The TOBACCO NEWS piece pointed out that the number of farm families who depend ‘on tobacco. runs a. good deal higher than the actual number of. tobacco farms, since medi- um-size and larger acreage allotments con- tribute !o the support of two, three or more tenant families. All in all, the piece asserts, the historical: place of tobacco in American agriculture is. expected to remain stable, which is a hope which a lot of Hopkins coun- tians will share, for tobacco is still an im- portant crop in our farm economy:     O2TEPSEOOT

It's been about as clean a month as we've had here in four or five years.”  All of that is bad news for the rest of what is the second-fastest field in Indy history, averaging 223.270 mph.  Raul Boesel, who finished fourth last year, is considered a top con tender today should the Penskes falter.  Starting his Lola-Ford Cosworth in the middle of the front row, Boe- sel is expected ta be among the first to find out if the Penskes have been intentionally hiding their advan- tage.  "No doubt the Penskes have a lot of power,” Boesel said. “We just don't know how much power they have, Even if I get a very good start, I probably won't be able to beat them to the (first) corner.  "Other than the Penskes, it wilk  be a very close field.

Roger Penske already has been con- ceded his t0th Indy 500 victory. The only question is which one of his drivers — Al Unser Jr., Emerson Fittipaldi or Paul Tracy — will wear the winner's garland.  Mercedes-Benz power under the Peuske engine covers is reportedly producing from 150 to 300 more horsepower than any of the conventional turbocharged Indy V8s or Buick V6és in the 33-car field.  And that’s why the most famous race in the world could turn into a Penske parade.  Penske, as skilled in business as he is in racing, took advantage of a rule thal had been largely ignored by the rest of the Indy- Car community, He had the new engines built just for Indianapolis.  The Mercedes power plants are stock- type, push-rod engines designed and built by Matio Illien and Paul Morgan, the same  Today’s race  Start 11 am, TV: WKOW  (Ch. 27), beginning at 10 eum,  adie: WTSO (1070 AM), beginning at 10 am.     men responsible for the dominating Chev- rolet Indy V8s of the past decade.  The other 15 races in the IndyCar series are sanctioned by Championship Auto Rac- ing Tears, but it is the U.S. Auto Club that oversees Indianapolis.  Under USAC rules for the Indy 500, the Mercedes engines are allowed 56 inches of turbocharger boost, 10 inches more than the conventional Fords and Ilmors. The Buicks get the same 55 inches but never have been able to figure out how to use the  A Penske party likely  extra air pressure to win the race.  The Penske-Mercedes cars did not over~ whelm the competition in qualifications, but there are two of them silting boldly at the front of the field, with Unser on the pole and defending and two-time race winner Fittipaldi on the outside of the front row.  Lurking back in the ninth of LI three-car rows is the third Penske entry, driven by Tracy, whose qualifying elfort was ham- pered by a crash during the first week of practice.  "Tt looks ike Penske has us covered, $0 we're running for best in class,” said Mario Andrettl, a former winner running his 29th and final Indy 500.  Even though nobody on Marlboro Team Penske is willing to admit fo any unfair ad- Vantage, the confidence rings in their voices.  “I've never had a car or a team this ready for victory at Indy,” Unser, the 1992  Please see INDY, Page 4D  MStarting grid for today's race/aD  WJohn Andretti goes for two/3D e. <     “For us to doa good lap, we need ‘momentum. They can gel back up to speed faster than we can, so if ‘we get slowed down an the straight: away or in the corner, the Penskes will have the advantage. That’s what I see, I hope I'm wrong.”  Unser led qualifying with a four- clap average of 226.011 mph, and ; Fittipaldi was the fastest in most of ithe daily practice sessions, All vthree of the Mercedes Jit up the scoring monitors with trap speeds ‘between 243 mph and 245 mpb at “the end of the back straightaway, ‘the fastest spot on the 2%-mile oval,  Even the slowest cars in the field had trap speeds near 230 mph. zAlthough it isn't the fastest, this is ‘the first Indy field with no one qualified below 220.

So lt certainly puts people in ¥iometimes compromising situa- tions, and it's going to be one that        you have to use very good judgment on, particularly at these speeds here."  Besides Fittlpaldi, who first won in 1989, and 1969 winner Andretti, the other former winners in the lineup are Unser (1992), Arie Luyendyk (1990) and Bobby Rahal {1986}, Andretti, the eldest in the lineup at 54, is oo am “Arrivederci, Mario" tour before his retirement at the end of the season.  Jacques Villeneuve, the fastest rookie and the youngest driver at 28, will start from the inside of the second cow, alongside Michael An- dretti, Mario's son," and Lyn St. James, the second woman to com- pete here.  Nigel Mansell, the defending series champlon, finished third at Indy last year and will start from the Inside of the third row, along- side 1993 runner-up Luyendyk and the elder Andretti.  John Andretti, Mario’s nephew, will start behind Mansell in row four, the first leg of an extremely difficult double.

But the win- dow is extremely narrow, with Indy expected to end shortly after 2 p.m.  and the NASCAR event set fo start 2 hours later. Flying time for the 366-mile trip Is sted at 53 minutes.  Besides Fittipaldi and Boese}, other Brazilians in the lineup are rookies Mauricie Gugelmin and Marea Greco. Ait are driving under the shadow of the May 1 death of countryman Ayrton Senna, a three- time Formula One champion killed in a race crash at Imola, Italy.  “Let's talk about the good things that (enna) did, what he left us to be proad of,” Boese) said. “He was a very great driver and a great hero in Brazil. This is how we should remember him. 1 dedicate my race to him.”  Seott Goodyear was 2 late addi- tion to the field for the second time in three years. In 1992, Goadyear’s quailfied car was bumped on the final day of time trials. He replaced then-teammmate Mike Groff, started 33rd and wound up second to Unser in the closest Indy finish ever.  It happened again this year. Goodyear’s car was the only one bumped on the final day of the trials and team owner Kenny Bern- stein pul him into the car qualified by teammate Davy Jones. ‘The Canadian driver again will start last.

L’ Organisation  mondiale de la santé (OMS) a recom-  mandé aux Etats-membres de publier les chiffres sur la mortalité due &  usage du tabac. Comme 'Helvétie a obél avec une rare Incompétence,  elle  devail s’attendre & recevolr ane lecgon @’honnéteté scientifique. Vollk qui  est fait avec la réplique — cinglante fesseur d'origine suisse dont le      1 — du Dr Peter.Atteslander, un pro-  paimarts fait autorité.  Une’ vérité scientifique plutdt qu'un pamphlet...  Le Confédération, ls Conférence des ,  directeurs cantonaux des affaires sani- taires et I’Association tabagisme s’tiaient unis pour publier une brochure consacrée & «La mortalité due au tabac en Suisse». Bonne idée, si I’on songe aux conséquences souvent tragiques du tabagisme. Mais aux yeux de Peter Atteslander, elle fut hélas mal concréti- sée, sentant plus le pamphiet de parti- sans que la vérité scientifique. A cause notamment des grossitres approxima- tions sur le nombre de décés attribués a ia fumée. soot  Utile prévention  Peter Atteslander, professeur @ I’Uni- versité d’Augsburg, approuve I’inten- tion a la base de la brochure, qui est de susciter des mesures de médecine pré-  : ventive contre la consommation exces- sive de tabac en raison de l‘augmenta-  tion des maladies de civilisation. Pour lui aussi, toute exagération dans la con- sommation d’alcool-ou de tabac peut #tre considérée comme dangereuse pour ja santé.  Mais lOffice fédéral de la santé publique et consorts auraient fait si mal que le professeur Atteslander y'va d°un pan sur le bec. «Le recours aux recom- mandations de "OMS ne dispense pas les auteurs de la brochure de l’obliga- tion de traiter les données épidémiologi- ques avec lexactitude requise et de ne  des mesures que sur la base de faits vérifiés», écrit-il. .  Hautement problématique  La brochure laisse croire que les chif-  BA  fres présentés seraient scientifiquement prouvés, alors que seules des probabili-. tés et non des certitudes sont obtenues, déplore Peter Atteslander. Ce dernier regrette encore que cle rapport attribue faussement A une simple relation causale l’explication de lorigine des maladies et ne Gent pas comptes de Paugmentation des maladies dites de civilisation et de la multitude des causes possibies».  La constatation de relations causaies est donc «hautement problématique», assure Peter Atteslander.  nnn TEI  ‘  Information ou manipulation?  S’appuyant sur les constatations de Martin Rutsch, le professeur pourfend le travail présenté par la Berne fédérale. «Données insuffisantes» «grossitres estimations», «base de calcul & la {ois fausse et obscures, collecte de données qui «manque de rigueur scientifique», les carences sont telles que Peter Attes- lander s’autorise & mettre «en garde contre l'usage naif des résultats présen- tés dans cette brochure en tant qu'ils constitueraient une base pour des déci- sions publiques». . /  Le professeur Atteslander n'y va pas par quatre chemins, qui fe aux éditeurs de «distinguer entre Pinfor- mation qui a pour but ls prévention  i t médicale et la manipulation de données |  épidémiologiques au service d'intérés |  Et la liberté?..00 |.  . Peter Atteslander estiment par ail- ° leurs que ce que pourrait se permettre  une association tabagisme en tant que . groupe d’intéréts identifiable ne corres pond pas au devoir de neutralité d'un office fédéral ou d’autorités desquels on serait en droit-d'attendre une stricte Legon de libesté enfin, qui engage le professeur Atteslander & prier les autori- tés' de considérer tous les diéments. «Nous devrions accepter les, cdtés posi- tifs des attitudes comportant un risque, surtout en ce qui concerne les décisions relevant de Ia liberté individuelie»,  souligne-t-il -°  . ¢ > + Raymond GREMAUD  : : _/  we,     Jue + en = ~: - at CH- 8230 Zirh. ieielor F "2Er goo  MME E REVUE HE Ait eate Loud LAtSeRde  Tse cogs queirdyer way ay quie helen Nev, TOA  nae ise .  24.

__label__1 &  DIET MATERIALROUND TO AFFECT THE BRAIN  Discovery Is Already in Use, With Promising Results, in Treating One Widespread Disorder        By HAROLD M. SCHIMECK Jr,  A common dietary substance found in| -  eggs, meat and fish has surprisingly di- yect and almost immediate effects on brain function, scientists at Massachu- setts Institute of Technology have found.  Their discovery has already been used, with promising results, in treating one widespread and disabling brain disorder. Research is in progress to see if the com- mon food substance called choline might also be useful in other brain conditions, including depression and the memory de- fects that are am important factor in se- nility.  All of these efforts stem from the dis- covery a few years ago that choline passes into the blood from food in the  _ digestive tract, is taken up directly by ‘the brain from the circulating blood. and is used to help the brain make an impor-  . tant chemical transmitter of nerve sig-  , tals, On an hour-to-hour basis the amount of the nerve signal transmitter in the brain seems to depend on how  * ruuch choline-rich food the individuel has eaten recently, :  “This is very sirange,” said Dr. Richard 3, Wurtman at an interview in his labora- tory in Cambridge, Mass. “because means that the composition of each meal will directly affect the synthesis of chemical signals in the brain.” .  For years it had been generally believed that something called the blood-brain barrier protecied the brain from direct effects of substances either lacking or  ‘excessive in a day-to-day diet. Only a few things, notably alcohol and some  powerful drugs such as the narcotics,|°  were thought to be exceptions, Gaps in the Barrier  Recent discoveries show that the blood . brain barrier has more gaps than had been thought, Thus, the person who eats  a large omelet with its high choline con- % will within a few hours have en oly of the nerve signal trastamite i6f Calied Guetyicholine in the brain.  This, according te Dr. Wurtman, wilt mean an amplification of the nerve sig. nals sent from one nerve cell to the next by those cells that use acetylcholine for' the signaling.  The possible effects of this on behavior are being studied. , . sees              i        New York Times January 26, 1978  “the main practical consequence thet has emerged from the work to date is in the treatment of a common disorder called tardive dyskinesia. This is a condi-  ‘tion that develops in many mental pa- > tients under regular treatment with either  of the two main classes of antipsychotic!  ’ rophenones, These drugs are used to calm  ‘ drugs, the phenothiezines or the buty-; 1  the patients and free them from the acute!  symptoms of their mental illness.

Yet there has been no effective; treatment for the condition and it has sometimes been permanent even when  tinued. One recent report said that as many as 40 percent of elderly, chronically| hospitalized mental patients using the drugs suffered from tardive dyskinesia and that it could be found in 3 percent  or more of a mixed population of mental| ,  patients, including the young. Those figures indicate thet the ‘condi-  Americans whe have taken the drugs for  The condition apparently results from a failure of brain nerve cells to release enough acetylcholine. For that reason, as  port indicating that rats’ brains producd extta amounts of the transmitter when they had extra choline in the blood, doo- tors at Stanford University fed choline  if it would hety, It did.  Last fali, Dr. Wurtman and three col- leagues, Dr. John H.

It is a good enwisifier and has other properties useful in commercially prepared cakes, gravies, salad dressings, beverage mixes and chocolate-covered candies. Commercial lecithin contains about 2 percent to 4 percent choline, Dr.  ’ Judith Wortman estimates.  No comparable hypotheses have arisen yet from the choline studies, but scien- tists at several institutions are studying possible ways in which this chemical can  _ be used to help the human brain.

__label__1 ip /By JUDITH EGERTON (a ‘arma Writer:         iS A new Louisville firm said yesterday that     duces the health risks of smoking.  That announcement, however, didn’t re- ceive ao enthusiastic response from tobacco companies or health officials.  L. Douglas Keeney, president and chief executive officer of C.A. Blockers Inc, in Meidinger Tower, said yesterday that the firm has successfully produced standard- sized cigarettes containing an additive that  _ Heutralizes the effect of nltrosamines, which ate carcinogens associated with lung can- cer.  The product, to be called N-BLOCTIN, could be available to tobacco companies this year, Keeney said. But first, tests will be done on people who smoke the cigarettes with the implanted additive. In a six-month test period, bronchial biopsies and ceil counts will be done on the smokers, he sald, to determine the product's effectiveness,  Keeney Sald in tests involving laboratary mice, N-BLOCTIN had proved to be “highly “effective” In blocking the accumulation of nitrosamines in the lungs.  The lab work was spearheaded by Dr. William Waddell, a toxdology specialist and chairman of the University of Loulsville De- partment of Pharmacology and Toxicology, who for years has been researching toxie effects of tobacco and searching for a com- pound to prevent the accumulation of car- cinogens, according {o Arthur Keeney.

__label__1 LOB  THE SUN MEAS  MYRTLE EACH. SC 643.900 r IRE 6943.3  wanes?         25h     OOo  Leslie gets his first Grand National win  THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  . CLERMONT, Ind. — Tracy Leslie, taking advantage of spins and wrecks that sidelined the frontrunners, beat David Green to the finish line by .73 seconds Satur- day night in winning the Kroger 200 NASCAR Grand National race at Indianapolis Raceway Park.  The victory was the first in 77  - Grand National starts for Leslie,  “T can’t say enough about the crew. They did it,” Leslie said. “We don’t know how many bumps (the Oldsmobile) has on it and now it's gt one on the roof’ from where  slie stood on it in victory circle.  “But we don’t care.”  Todd Bodine and Robert Pressley were fighting for the lead on lap 172 when they came up on the slower Buick of Troy Beebe. Pressley’s Chevrolet took the low side and Bodine’s Chevy the high, and ‘all three spun into the wail. Tommy Houston’s Ford, running third at the time, also became in- volved, as did the Chevys of Larry Pearson and Steve Grissom. A red flag was shown to stop the field while tracks crews cleaned up the mess.  No drivers were hurt.  Winston Cup veteran Terry Labonte rallied from three laps down to take third with Burton coming home fourth.  Polesitter Ernie Irvan was the fastest car on the track much of the night but his Chevy blew an engine on lap 151.     Mansell wins Marlboro  BROOKLYN, Mich. — Nigel Mansell ignored the bumpy track and shrugged off a raging headache to hold off teammate Mario Andretti_ and win Sunday's Marl-  boro 500 at Michigan International Speedway.  Mansell, running only the second 500-mile race of his career, domi- nated the 250-lap race on the 2- mile, high-banked oval and re- gained the IndyCar PPG Cup point lead from Emerson Fittipaldi, who struggled to a 13th-place finish on the hot, humid afternoon.  The Briton, who was the Formu- la One champion last season, took the lead from pole-winner Andretti on the 28th lap and led 2 of the last 221 Japs, including the final 167.  Mansell, who finished third to Fittipaldi in May in his first India- napolis 500, had more problems with the rough track and the heat on Sunday than he did with any other driver in the 23-car ficid.  “The circuit is just fantastic,” he said. “It stands alone, just like Indi- anapolis. P've never driven anything like it in my life and it’s beaten me. Tm glad there wasn’t another 10 laps because I was hanging in there  just at the end and I don’t mind '  telling the world I'm tired.”  Mensell crossed the finish line 9.434 seconds ahead of Andretti, with Arie Luyendyk of the Nether- lands, who was the Indy runnerup, a lap down in third and Boesel an- other lap back in fourth.

__label__1 Smokers, stores deal with recall  BY CHARLES SLACK TIMES-DISPATCH STAFF WRITER  For the next few days, Philip Mor- ris cigarettes may be harder to find than sissies in Marlboro Country.  Stores in Richmond and around the country began pulling cartons from their shelves after Philip Morris USA on Friday announced a recall of 12 brands and 36 package types. The recalled cigarettes include Marl- boros, the company’s most popular brand, which are made in Richmond.  Defective filters in some ciga- rettes could cause wheezing and diz- ziness, the company said.  Spokesman David Laufer said the company doesn’t believe any defec- tive cigarettes have reached stores, but, “we’re casting a pretty wide     PLEASE SEE RECALL, PAGE A25 >»  ‘ness, OWA y  .£4-In Richmond yesterday afternoon,  Stores deal     ¥ RECALL FROM PAGE Al net.”  - + The unusual recall of up to 8 billion cigarettes could cost about $200 mil- lion, the company estimated. It said the affected brands should be avail- able again within several days.  : Laufer said it was impossible to know which, if any, cigarettes made ‘at the company’s South Richmond ‘plant contained the defective filters. ‘The filters were supplied by a New Jersey company, Hoechst Celanese.  ' UThe company said “a small per- icentage” of filters were found to con- tain * a : material that could cause ‘smokers “temporary discomfort” stanging from a bad taste and eye, mose and throat irritation to dizzi- coughing or wheezing.  4  - Several large chain retailers already ‘ had pulled cigarettes on the recall  ‘list. But some smaller stores said they were unaware of the problem or shadn’t received official notification.  «4 Laufer said some ' retailers might ‘not have received Mailgrams an- nouncing the recall. But he urged all stores to pull the affected brands and he urged customers to return ciga- rettes that are on the list.  ‘ The company is dispatching thou- sands of sales representatives to vis- it all 370,000 retailers nationwide ‘that sell Philip Morris cigarettes dur- ing the next few days. The sales reps  will examine code numbers on the  pulled cartons and decide whether  they can be returned to the shelves. »: Some Richmond-area retailers ‘said smokers were concerned and “were switching to other brands tem- - porarily. .' “They’re trading for Winston and : Salem,” said Kyung Chung, owner of ‘Boulevard Market in the Fan Dis- - trict. “They don’t want to smoke the Philip Morris Cos. product right “now.”                            «Philip: Moris USA Is recalling’ cigarettes which may: contain lefective-fitters. “ Marlboro.

Mullins, owner of Morris -Super Market near Ashland, said, “I “have not had anyone bring a pack in all day” for a refund. In fact, one woman who-had bought Camel Lights at a nearby store that had stopped selling Marlboros asked Mullins to swap for her preferred brand. He obliged.  Mullins, a retired Philip Morris mechanic who smokes the compa- ny’s cigarettes, said he thinks Philip  Morris is recalling the brands “just to be-on the safe side.”  “They'll spend thousands of dol- lars to get back a pack that looks _bad,” he said. ~~ Like several other proprietors of non-chain stores contacted yester- day, Mullins said that as of yesterday evening he hadn’t pulled any brands from his shelves because he hadn’t gotten word to do so.  asic:-100's Menthol and: Basic _ Basic Lights King Size...

Sanford listed five specific criticisms of the Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health:  IN TWO PLACES the Teport says thet “statistical methods cannot establish proof of a causal relationship in an association.

Terry San- ford made a prediction Monday of “new levels of growth and prosperity” for the tobacco in- dustry “once it is freed from the clouds of health considerations" by research into the cause of cancer and heart disease  Addressing the National As- sociation of Tobacco Distribu- tors, Sanford said the gavera- ment report on smoking “raised & lot of questions but didn’t find the answers."  Sanford, gevernor of a state that produces two-thirds of the nation’s tohucco, challenged the basis on which he said “exces- sively deduated regulators”  were seeking to take tobacco away {rom ils users,  “What.” he asked, “would satisfy the ological needs ef the 70 million Amercans who smoked in 1963, if they were suddenly deprived of tobacco?”  Antismoking campaigns of today, he said. are being waged “prumarily with statistical cor relations of one kind or an- other."  Declaring that the govern: Ment report “doesn't pin down the condemnation of tobacco,” he proposed a continuing study af tobacco “lo identify anil eliminate the suspecled health risks," and a more intensive Bludy of cancer and heart ail ments.  Sanford said that since 1900 the annual death rate from ma- jor luag ailments has fallen by 84 per cent, during a period which cigarette smoking was on the merense.  Sarford hit at what he called fneon-'stencies in the recent re- port af the U.S. surgeon general linkirs cigarette smoking and lune cancer.  “| dn ant in any way discredit the revert fo the surgeon gen- ea." said Sanford. “But when loam asked if it doesnt pin @ovn hs condemnation of to- ba‘co, once and for all, my €ns ver 15, emphatically, that it does not”  Sanford called attention to statistical surveys nut used by  the advisory committee and cit- ed the incadence of tung cancer in non-smokers.

__label__1 THE WALL STREET JOURNAL WEDNESDAY, APRIL 24, 1994 BAL  Exposure to Workplace Tobacco Smoke Is Greater Than Believed, Study Says  By Trmorsy oar Staff Reporcer of Tax Wau. Srtmer JovRNAL WASHINGTON — Passive smake in the workplace might be a much bigger health danger than U.S. Workers have been led to halieve, according fo a new government study. The new findings come from the Cen- ters for Disease Control, and appear in a  Hearts and Wallets at Odds Iva wilikely that sither individuals or ‘mutual funds will be able to kek the habit of investing in tobacen companice, Fund Track, page C1.  special issue of the Journal of the Ameri- catt Medical Association on the heaith impacts of tobacco, At a news conference yesterday te publicize the journal’s re- search, AMA officials urged investors to avoid 13 stocks and 1,474 mutual funds that invest in tobacco manufacturing. The AMA Shed {ts own tobacco holdings in 1986.  The passive-sinoke findings represent fhe most extensive data ever compiled on nonsinokers’ exposure to cigarette smoke in the U.S. The new information will likely add ballast t antismaking groups’ efforts at the federal, state and local levels to ban smoking in office buildings and other public places. .  According to the study, 87.9% of all nonsimkers in the U.S. have detectable levels of cotinine in their blood. Cotinine is . a nicotine residue chat turns up in the blood Serum of individuals exposed to tobacco smoke. The survey, conducted from 1988 to 1991, involved physical examinations of 12,678 Individuals nationwide, Nousmokers Understate Exposure  Of the noasmokers surveyed. 12.4% reported they were exposed fo tobacco smoke at work only, compared with 7.7% whe reported (hey were exposed to tobacco stnoke at home only; 38.8% reported no exposure at ali, and 3.1% reported expe Sure at both home and work.  The JAMA study offers strong evidence fhat people tend to understale their expo sure to passive smoke. There is a wide gap between nonsmokers who say they are  ‘exposed to tobacco smoke — 37% of adults and 43% of children — compared with the 37.9% whose cotinine shows they are ax- posed. This gap is significant because most previous studies of workplace paasive- stoke exposure, many af them funded by the tabacco industry, relied on survey data rather than blood samples. :  Even though the stody found that mora noUSMmOKers are exposed to tobacco smoke at work than at home, the study makes Clear that the amount of nlentine absorbed inte @ nonsmoxer’s bloodstreatt is likelier to ba higher iF one lives with 2 smoker than if one works with one. Nonstokers ex- Posed to tobacco at home had roughly twice as Much cotinine in their blood as nen-                        smokers exposed (o tobacco at work.  The federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration has proposed a rep- ulation that would ban virtually ail smok- ing in the workplace. Bui the agency has moved slowly in issuing a final rule ~ it isn't expected this year — partly because agency officials aré combing through a mountain of public comments and partly because of budget euts. The new findings were made avaliable to OSHA before its comment period on the smoking rule ended in mid-January. ‘  The Environmental Protection Agency declared passive smoke a carcinogen nearly four years ago, but thelr finding has stirred some controversy in the scientific community, A racent report by the Con- gressional Research Service expressed such uncertainty on the opie that advo- cates far and against tobacea both claimed vindication from it.  But James Firkle, the study's lead author, yesterday said the new findings are “much better data than the CRS report ever looked at." ‘  But Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman forthe Tobacco Institute, said of the JAMA findings, “It's net a health-effects study.” She said the shidy focused on nicotine exposure as measured in “molecules, and that the source of these wace amounts might be certain foods, such as tomatoes or potatoes, or a “momentary whiff" of to- bacco smoke.

__label__1 vee ee ee ne ee ee ee etn eine #e “ 4  State of Immunity And Personality Tied to Cancer  Medical Tribune Report CAREFREE, ARiIz.—The role of the emo- tional state in association with malignant disease has recently been sharpened to an extent that enables a delineation of the “cancer-prone personality.”  And what ultimately makes him sus- ceptible to cancer may be a psychologi- cally triggered alteration in his immune defense.  Both views, and some supporting ex- periments, were reported here at the 13th annual Science Writers Seminar of the American Cancer Society.  The personality sketch was described by Claus Bahnson, Ph.D., senior research scientist at the Eastern Pennsylvania Psy- chiatric Institute in Philadelphia, who for more than 10 years has been testing and interviewing hundreds of cancer patients for comparison with normal persons and, more recently, with coronary patients and  Medical Tribune May 5, 1971  patients with a variety of other somatic diseases.  In general, he said, the cancer patient represses all unpleasant “affect states,” such as anxiety, depression, hostility, or guilt, much more effectively than nor- mals or other sick persons do. As might be deduced from that, the cancer pa- tient feels the least stress in his job, re- cent stress of any kind, or psychic anxiety and is furthest from the “pat- tern A” associated with myocardial in- farction (competitive, restless, anxiety- laden).  From childhood the typical cancer pa- tient recalls a life that was “bleak and un- satisfying,” remembering mother as un- loving and unprotecting and father as un- protecting and undemanding. The upshot is a person who conforms to social norms, living “a formal, realistic, and common- sense—oriented effective social and family life unrelated to his basic needs for affec- tion, warmth, and personal creativity.”  “The cancer patient is a nice guy,” Dr. Bahnson said, and has great difficulty deal- ing with or expressing anger.  Subjected to statistical analysis, the “projection score” data on cancer patients compared with normals and patients with other ills indicated the cancer patients’ re- pression of emotions was significantly greater than normals for all indices and greater than that of any other patient in all indices except guilt, where there was no meaningful difference between cancer, coronary, and other sick patients.  Dr. Bahnson said he currently is work- ing with cancer specialists and immunolo- gists in an effort to pin down a relationship between affect and stress states and im- mune reactions in cancer patients com- pared with normals. As it stands now, -he said, on a purely empiric basis it should be possible to screen psychologically a ran- dom group of people and accomplish a 30 per cent improvement in forecasting which members of the group are most likely to develop cancer.

__label__1 Pointers For Parents  Edina Sentinel Edina, MO January 3, 2001        Start Talking To Stop Youth Smoking     (NAPSA)-Parents possess a pow- erful weapon to combat youth smoking-conversation-but many stay silent on the topic of tobacco, not knowing what to say or how to begin. Yet each day, thousands of children across the U.S. try their first cigarette, hoping to fit in. igok cool, rebel-or simply experiment.  Fortunately, parents now have a tool to help them begin a dialogue on not smoking-the “Take {10° instructional video featuring tips from Dr. Michael Popkin, founder and president of Active Parenting Publishers and the author of more than 20 parenting books and videos.  The video is part of the "Take 10” parent education initiative launched last year as part of the Lorillard Tobacco Company"s Youth  Smoking Prevention Program. In addition to the video, which is avail- able free to leaders of parent groups.  the program also includes the 2takelO.com Web site and a free brochure.  Any time is a good time  Most parents want family time together to be stress-free, and check- ing in with kids about important top- ics like not smoking isn't easy.  “Kids get uncomfortable easily- and may back away from any kind of formal discussion.” says Dr. Popkin. “Limit the first conversa- tion to about 10 minutes-to open the dialogue.”  When there is mutual trust, open cummunication between parents and children isn’t far behind. De. Popkin suggests three simple steps for     establishing expectations and build-.  ing trust:  . Listen to your child. Come from caring, not judgement.  . Teli your child how .you would feel if he or she tried smok- ing. Be careful not to lecture.  . Establish consequences, explain how disappointed you’  would feel or what you would do if  he or she smoked.  Many parents don’t realize how strong of an impact they can make by spending a few minutes talking with their kids-especially about dif- ficult topics.  Bringing “Take 10” home The free “Take 10” instructional video is available to parenting and  community groups by calling toll-  free 1-800-825-0060, or through www.activeparenting.com. Parents can receive the “Take 10” brochure by calling toll-free 1-877-2TAKE10 or visiting www.2takel0.com. Lorillard Tobacco Company’s “TakelO” program is part of its national volunteer effort aimed at reducing youth smoking. It is designed to instruct parents on how to discuss not smoking with their kids. In addition, Lorillard sponsors a national advertising campaign and the Teen H.LP. Awards, a scholar- ship program aimed at reaching kids about not smoking, For more infor- mation about the initiatives, visit the program Web sites at www.buttout how.com or www.2takel0.com.  69265826

__label__1 INGLEWOOD NEWS Inglewood, California January 18, 1957  % We Believe  WHERE THERE'S SMOKE...  If you watch television with any de- gree of regularity. it may seem evident to you that salesmanship is responsible for the report that at the end of 1956, the filter-tin variety has captured nearly one- third of the American cigaret market.  On the other hand, science, fear or superstition may have had equally as much todo with this change in the Amer- can cigaret smoker's habits.  Thirteen billion more cigarets were smoked during 1956 in spite of increasing reports linking smoking with lung can- cer. From this, it may be deduced that while the catchy jingles and dramatiza- tions that are presentcd over TV may have had a great deal to do with filter-tip cigaret sales’ increase, the compelling de- sire of smokers to put something between themselves and the possible harmful ef- fects of tobacco cannot be discounted.  So the scare lingers on, -while a prob- ably fictitious faith is being placed in the wide variety of filters on cigarets.  Cigaret companies for many years sought a mild tobacco. Growers sought to supply this demand by carefully breed- ing plants that would turn out a tobacco leaf low in nicotine.  Now the rush seems to be toward the filtered variety of cigarets, so jn order to get some flavor through to the smoker, stronger tobaccos are preferred. The practice has been for the best tebaccos to go into standard cigarets, while the harsher blends are put in front of the filters. Therefore. the flight to filter-tips may in reality be a rush to the kind of tobacco that does the most damage to health.  No one has yet proved conclusively that there is any harmful effect from smoking. but the new trend, induced by the possibilty of such dangers, is causing nothing but confusion to tobacco farmers and plant breeders.  The most confused people in the whole situation, however, may be those smokers who, to reduce their fears about the peril, if any, from smoking are putting them- elves behind filters but by no means cut of all possible harm's wav.

Other Forms of Air Pollution Probably Holp Boost Riso in Lung Casas,     Specific laboratory proof that cigarette smoking causes cancer of the lungs has not been adduced, but five experts conducting a pulmonary dis- ease clinic at the University of Kansas Medical Center to- day agreed that clinical rec- ords indicate a relationship between heavy smoking and such cancers,  However, added the experts, smoking likely is only one of several air pollutions in city life today ihat may be boost- ing the remarkable rise in lung cancers. The other pol: lutions:  Motor car exhausts, especi- ally from use of high-octane gasolines.  Fumes Pervade Air.  Coal fire fumes, more heavy in European than American cities, from home and factory chimneys.  Fuel oil and oil refinery fumes from homes or fac- tories.  Heavy use of macadams and tars for road surfacing.  The experts polled here are Dr. Jobn McClement of Colum- bia university, Dr. Hurley Motley of the University of Southern California. Dr. How- ard Van. Orstrand of the Cleveland clinic, Dr. Julius Wilson of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Martin FitePatrick, head of the lung disease section of the K. U. center.  The five also agreed cancer is not the only lung affliction which may be inc!ted by smok- ing and other pollutants. These aggravants often are factors in bronchitis (inflam- mation of the bronchial tubes). which, when chronic, may bring on emphysema, a dis- erder in the lungs’ ability to oxpel air.

Annual Convention  BOYDTON — The 77th annual Convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation was held at the Convention Center in Reno, Nevada, the week of January 7-11, 1996, oo,  The activities began on Sunday when the Women’s and Young Farmer’s Programs were held.  The American Farm, Bureau  Women announced that, through volunteer fund raising, the women had raised thirty thousand dollars in private funds to help build and make operational a fruit, and, vegetable canning facility in the Western  Ukraine. The check was presented  during the meeting to the Citizens  of Network for Foreign Affairs,  The campaign was launched in Oc-  tober 1994 and after ten Farm  Bureau women spent three weeks in  the Ukraine with the .C.N.F.A.  Agribusiness Volunteer Program,  . Money was donated by farm  families across the U. S$. and the  project helped to reflect this year’s meeting theme ‘‘Grasstoots to  Global’* . . .. Jn the Young Farmer meeting, “the “discussion meet was held. young frmets from many states . €figagad in ten rounds of discussions  on previously assigned topics in an  elimination process. The winner was Casey Niemann of Kansas and his prize was a new Dodge pickup truck. The A.F.B.F. Achievement  Award went to Mike DeSutter of Il-  linois. He was also the winner of a  new Dodge pickup.  At the opening session, A.F.B.F, President Dean Kleckner gave an interesting and informative address, speaking to the 5,700+ farmers and ranchers in attendance. -  ‘Kleckner serves on the National commission of Economic growth and,Tax reform which is chaired by  Jack Kemp. His question. was, “How Big Government and at what cost?’” His philosophy is: cut the  budget, stop spending, no new.  taxes, and spend within it’s means like all businesses and home owners must do. We need leaders with an understanding of budgeting.  Farm programs have been ‘“‘over- whelmed’* by the National Budget Debate, but Farm Bureau js calling for adequate financial support for agricultural research and market development programs. These pro- grams are agriculture’s future. Dollars: spent in these areas are returned many times over.  Last year the United States sold approximately $53- billion of agricultural goods to foreign buyers and ‘it is expected that this year’s sales will reach $58 billion, Farm Bureau will continue to work to ex- pand trade throughout. the world.  Kieckner also pledged that Farm Bureau will continue to seek proper- ty rights protection and. common sense teform of environmental regulations and the Endangered Species Act. ,  Kleckner stressed that-cutting the capital gains tax rate, raising the Estate Tax exemption level, in- creasing the deductions of self employed health insurance, and providing enhanced depreciation schedules must remain tied to farm program approval as these measures will affect farmers in a positive manner,  The farmers and ranchers atten- ding the convention also heard talks by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch, who is Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Ed Madigan, Secretary of Ariculture, spoke to all county  presidents: in attendance at a lun- cheon on Monday.  , Speed skater Bonnie Blair ad- ~ dressed the group on Tuesday..In ,  her speech, she stressed “Set ‘Boals and be dedicated, have a balance in  your life, and don’t be afriad to take  tisks: These. three things apply to life no matter if you are a farmer, a speed skater or any: other profes- sion in Which you dre engaged.”  There were. conferences and workshops on many topics during the week, Some of these topics in- cluded Risk Management; Precision Farming, . Property Rights, Tax  Reform, Dairy, Beef Cattle, _ Government.Regulations, and other,  subjects. © Pos Delegates elected to the conven- tion from each state discussed and established Farm Bureau policy on a diverse list of, issues. - A.F.B.F. is ‘organized in fifty.  states and Puerto Rico, and in more, ,  than 2,800,.countries. There are more than four and a half million ,  Farm Bureau members nationwide.’  Farm Bureau is. an independent, non-governmental, voluntary organization, of farm and ranch’ families.  NOOSE?

Sanford, gevernor of a state that produces two-thirds of the nation’s tohucco, challenged the basis on which he said “exces- sively deduated regulators”  were seeking to take tobacco away {rom ils users,  “What.” he asked, “would satisfy the ological needs ef the 70 million Amercans who smoked in 1963, if they were suddenly deprived of tobacco?”  Antismoking campaigns of today, he said. are being waged “prumarily with statistical cor relations of one kind or an- other."  Declaring that the govern: Ment report “doesn't pin down the condemnation of tobacco,” he proposed a continuing study af tobacco “lo identify anil eliminate the suspecled health risks," and a more intensive Bludy of cancer and heart ail ments.  Sanford said that since 1900 the annual death rate from ma- jor luag ailments has fallen by 84 per cent, during a period which cigarette smoking was on the merense.

__label__1 INGLEWOOD NEWS Inglewood, California January 18, 1957  % We Believe  WHERE THERE'S SMOKE...  If you watch television with any de- gree of regularity. it may seem evident to you that salesmanship is responsible for the report that at the end of 1956, the filter-tin variety has captured nearly one- third of the American cigaret market.  On the other hand, science, fear or superstition may have had equally as much todo with this change in the Amer- can cigaret smoker's habits.  Thirteen billion more cigarets were smoked during 1956 in spite of increasing reports linking smoking with lung can- cer. From this, it may be deduced that while the catchy jingles and dramatiza- tions that are presentcd over TV may have had a great deal to do with filter-tip cigaret sales’ increase, the compelling de- sire of smokers to put something between themselves and the possible harmful ef- fects of tobacco cannot be discounted.  So the scare lingers on, -while a prob- ably fictitious faith is being placed in the wide variety of filters on cigarets.  Cigaret companies for many years sought a mild tobacco. Growers sought to supply this demand by carefully breed- ing plants that would turn out a tobacco leaf low in nicotine.  Now the rush seems to be toward the filtered variety of cigarets, so jn order to get some flavor through to the smoker, stronger tobaccos are preferred. The practice has been for the best tebaccos to go into standard cigarets, while the harsher blends are put in front of the filters. Therefore. the flight to filter-tips may in reality be a rush to the kind of tobacco that does the most damage to health.  No one has yet proved conclusively that there is any harmful effect from smoking. but the new trend, induced by the possibilty of such dangers, is causing nothing but confusion to tobacco farmers and plant breeders.  The most confused people in the whole situation, however, may be those smokers who, to reduce their fears about the peril, if any, from smoking are putting them- elves behind filters but by no means cut of all possible harm's wav.

The other pol: lutions:  Motor car exhausts, especi- ally from use of high-octane gasolines.  Fumes Pervade Air.  Coal fire fumes, more heavy in European than American cities, from home and factory chimneys.  Fuel oil and oil refinery fumes from homes or fac- tories.

The five also agreed cancer is not the only lung affliction which may be inc!ted by smok- ing and other pollutants.

It will be held April 12-14, 1996.: This symposium will explore the ways both:single celled organisms and multicellular organisms establish axes and pattern for asymmetric cell division and embryonic development, and will include discussion of organisms as diverse as bacteria, yeast, algae, nematodes, insects, and vertebrates. This letter i is: written to request financial assistance for our graduate student symposium.  This will be the sixteenth symposium organized by the graduate students in MCD Biology.: A unique feature of this event is that it is organized and run entirely by graduate students from our department. These symposia allow us.to interact with prominent scientists from diverse disciplines one-on-one, and introduce us to. deeper . insights into many important questions facing biologists today. These symposia also | serve to enliven the scientific atmosphere of the region by bringing-prominent biologists from around the world to Boulder,  In the past, the Graduate Student Symposium has been made possible by generous donations from biotechnology companies, from companies that:do business with researchers in the Boulder area, and from others interested in biology. The total cost of. the symposium, the majority of which is used for transportation and lodging of the - speakers, is estimated at 15,000 dollars. Past contributions have ranged from 500 to 3500 dollars. -Any contribution would be greatly appreciated, and acknowledged both at the symposium and in the symposium program which is given to each attendee.  Enclosed please find a tentative schedule for this year’s symposium, as well as schedules from past symposia. A member of the Graduate Student Symposium Organizing . Committee will be contacting you by phone to discuss this request. We-would like to. thank you for your time and effort, and hope that t you are as excited about this year’s symposium as.we are.

__label__6 P. R. J. Burch Smoking and’ Lung Cancer: the Problem of Inferring Cause Jour. Royal Statistical Soc. A 141 (Pt. 4) 437-477 (1978)     Stating that the dogma that lung cancer is almost entirely due to cigarette smoking rests largely and necessarily on epidemiological studies, Professor Burch reviews the many methodological problems arising in epidemiology-such as the impossibility of randomizing for smoking, constitutional differences between smokers and nonsmokers, the heterogeneity of the human population, clinical diagnostic error changes, and the frequency association is identified with cause. Also, there is no comprehensive theory of carcinogenesis that as yet commands general acceptance. He then describes the association between smoking and lung cancer and their connection with sex and country. Secular trends in recorded mortality from lung cancer in England and Wales,  1901 to 1970, are derived from the Registrar General's statistics.  Estimates are made of the expected trends assuming that the assoctations found between the various types of smoking and lung cancer reflect causation. Observed and expected trends conflict. The secular trends in mortality  from lung cancer in British male doctors are also examined. He argues  that no definitive conclusions can be reached about the extent of any  causal link between smoking and lung cancer. It is very doubtful that  the entire association observed between smoking and lung cancer in occidental males should be interpreted in causal terms.     96n9 SILOS     RJR-US v. PM, ET AL.

__label__1 Letters to the Editor  On Ulcer Therapy Sir: I read the article on ‘“Contro- versies-in Ulcer Therapy” (MWN, June 23) with interest. Some years ago, I discarded the’ theory of hyperacidity as a total ‘ cause for the presence of the benign duodenal or gastric ulcer, and decided that the Sippy diet was inadequate. Benign duodenal or gastric ulcer is     a multifaceted disorder involving not only hyperacidity but hypermotility, infection, allergy, and local endarte- ritis obliterans. Although I am a sur- geon, I recognize that adequate medi- eal therapy for the benign ulcer must include eradication of any or all of the above factors in order to satisfac- torily rectify the disease.  ‘The Sippy diet was discarded by me because it not only did not clear all the symptoms but left the patient weak and unhappy. With the treat- ment that I followed [which begins with placing the patient on a milk-, wheat-, and egg-free diet] not only was relief frequently obtained, but there was an absence of the monot- ony of a milk and cream diet.

I have been in general practice for 41 years in the western part of Cin- cinnati, and although I have not kept the kind of statistics that research people do, I have come to some very firm conclusions about the relation- ship of smoking to ulcers.  In fact, I have had many patients come to me with recurrent ulcers— having been treated by other doctors without success—who healed their ul- cers within a few weeks when the abolition of smoking was added to their daily routines. I have also had many other patients who did not stop smoking and who had recurrences, al- though they stayed on a diet and [took] antacids.  As a result of this experience, for the past 20 years I have refused to treat all ulcer patients unless they  ‘ would promise to stop smoking per-  manently. FOSTER M. WILLIAMS, M.D. Cincinnati  Sir: “Controversies in Uleer Therapy” interested me very much in that at this late hour in medical history con- troversy should exist on the subject.

The board has $500,000 to work with.  “We will tackle simultane. ously many of the unknowns in this field of tobacco use in re- lation to human health,” said Dr. Clarence Cook Little, Bar Harbor, Maine, chairman of the research board.  Statisticat studies and experi- menis recently linked smoking, especially cigarets, with a rapid rise in human lung cancer. Ciga- rets also have been charged with creating an ‘extra hazard of causing heart attacks,  BUT SOME sscienlisis. and physicians have said they are by no means convinced, or doubt there is any link.  Little’s board said it will co- ordinate research in these six gentral areas:  A study of human lung can- cer in 10 major medical centers in the United States and Can- ada, checking lungs for evi- dences of the sites and time of beginning of cancer.  Study of animals while inhal- ing smoke under controlled conditions, to see if there are effects on lung cancer, growth rates, heart and blood vessels, and nervous tissues.  Study of the effect of known smoke tars, obtained under con- trolled conditions, on tissues of animals which naturally vary in their susceptibility to cancer or other diseases.

The program recognizes we do not have today the experiment- al evidence that will permit scientific conclusions regarding the cause and effect relationship between environmental factors, including smoking, and lung cancer.”  One researcher who linked cancer with cigaret smoking, meanwhile, recommended that the cigaret industry try to pro- auce a “safe” cigaret, rather than undertake the “nearly im- possible task of proving con- clusively” whether smoking is a factor in cancer or heart disease.  He is Dr. E. Cuyler Ham- mond, statistical director of the American Cancer Society. Addressing the ACS annual meeting, he said there is “hope” of producing a “safe” cigaret. It will take far longer to define cigaret smoking’s effects on the body than fo produce a tobacco which can be shown to have less harmful effect on respira- tion and heartbeat, he said,

I have seen un- der the microscope (at a magnifica- tion of x 1600) the disintegration of the medullary area of the shaft of a diseased whitened hair, while the cor- tex was relatively intact. .

Block, Freda Camuzsi, Waiter Voiqt, and Albert Castro*  Departments of Pathology, Urology and Hormone Research Laboratory University of Miami School of Medicine Miami, Florida  ABSTRACT -  Bicchemical entagonism between heparin and ascorbic acid was described (Owen et. al., 1970). Ascorbic acid is found in high concentrations in adrenal and testicular tissue and piays an important role in steroid synthesis in these tissues. To determine  s with ascorbic acid, levels of testosterone were studied in testi- cular tissue of adult male Syrian golden hamsters and in testicular | plasma of adult male Sprague-Dawiey rats during heparin treatment.     To determine concentrations of testosterone in tissue the double isotepe derivative assay method was used, Radioimmunoassay was used to detexmine testosterone concentrations in plasme., Wo inhibitory effect was Getected when testosterone comeentrutions in  ~ the treated groups were compared with these in the control groups.  INTRODUCTION  The interplay of sex hormones has been known to be associated with ascorbic acid metabolism in various animals, Testosterone - administration to castrated male albiro rats was found to restore hepatic contents of ascorbic acid metabolites to the shum control levels (Khandwekar et. al., 1974).

__label__6 DRAF'?-DRAFT-DRAFT—-DRAFT~-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT—-DRAFT—DRAFT—-DRAFT—-DRAFT HIGHLIGHTS DATE: April 24, 1990 BIOBEHAVIORAL RESEARCH -  Psychophysiology of Smoking - Integration of analytical chemistry data with EEG, heart rate, task-performance, and mood/feeling rating data from the 1989 EEG study was begun. Subjects were segregated into 3 groups based on pre- to post-smoking plasma nicotine ‘rise’. Appropriate analyses of Variance are underway.  Drs. Reynolds, Robinson, and Pritchard met discuss a study to determine the optimal structure for DFC (Desire For Cigarette) measurement. Ina subsequent meeting, Drs. Robinson and Pritchard planned the detailed experimental design.  Basic Sensory Research - Evoked brain potentials, respiration, and sensory data were collected from one subject during exposure to nicotine. This session completed collection of required evoked potential data for 6 subjects. Collection of data from subject 5, an in-house volunteer, is all that remains for the completion of this phase of the work.  Mr. Roger Jennings prepared computer files of sensory attribute data on ETS chemicals from recently published reports. Sensory information on chemicals in ETS will be incorporated into a relational database that contains other information on the compounds. The data base will be used to answer end-user questions on specific chemicals or sensory characteristics. UNIFY database software, currently on the Biobehavioral Division’s SUN computer, was evaluated by Mr. Jennings for use with the ETS data.  Dr. Jim Walker attended the 12th annual meeting of the Association of Chemoreception Sciences. He presented a paper entitled "Effects of Odorants on Respiratory Behavior and Nasal Patency." It was timely, owing to a great deal of interest by meeting participants in the question of perceived irritation in humans. The following were noted at the meeting: an increase in research on primate gustatory and olfactory systems, renewed interest in "taste" sensations mediated by the olfactory system, increased representation of manufacturers of fragrances and others who use fragrances to enhance product appeal, increased competition among NIH-funded chemosensory centers, increased interest in the "olfactory deficit" in Alzheimer’ Ss disease, sophisticated use of voltage-sensitive dyes and video- imaging techniques, interest in the measurement of human respiratory behavior, an increase in the number of industrial chemosensory scientists conducting psychophysical studies, an increase in the number of chemosensory scientists in consumer product R&D, and increased interest in odorant-evoked potentials.  Smoke Component Dose - Mr. Davis sought information from Dr. Brian Lawrence and Mr. Brian Smeeton (P&AT) about tea cultivation and the use of nicotine sulfate as a pesticide. Mr. Davis is preparing to survey a number of teas for potential nicotine content. We and others have observed nicotine in teas previously.  Nicotine Receptor Pharmacology - Dr. Eric Fluhler continued to characterize     the effects of nicotine on calcium flux in synaptosomes prepared from adult ~~  rat brain. Results indicate that micromolar concentrations of nicotine Significantly increase intrasynaptosomal concentrations of calcium.

While important preliminary information can be, and due to ethical considerations must be, obtained from in vitro systems and animal models the ultimate species of interest is the human being. Thus, measuring biological activity in human beings following exposure to the agent of interest is an integral part of safety assessment. Traditionally, urine and blood cells(lymphocytes) from exposed human beings have been used to assess exposure to biologically-active materials. These techniques are the two most widely used methods for assessing biological activity in human beings and have  been used by scientists around the world to maasure the biological activity of cigarette smoke. *  EXPERIMENTAL METHODS SUBJECTS: Number of groups = 33 one non-smoking control group and two test  groups Subjects per group = approximately 25 Coe ; Sex = each group should be one-half male, one-half female ~ Age = 21 to 654 each group must be matched for age 7 Health = all potential subjects should be in good physical condition with no recent history of bacterial illness  subjects which contract a bacterial illness during the study  should be dismissed  whack, fo = Drug use = all subjects must refrain from drug use during the study.

__label__6 Dr. Redford B. Williams, Jr. (Duke University Medical Center) opened the conference with a discussion of hostility and hormones as biobehavioral mechanisms in CAD. He said that looking at type A behavior is like looking at total cholesterol. There are a lot of components, some of which are toxic, some may be protective, and some may not be related to the development of CAD. The so-called global type A behavior should be broken down into its microcom ponents and their contributions, individually and in combination with other components, need to be assessed. The microcomponent concept may explain why some small angiographic studies have failed to show an effect of type A be-  “havior in CAD. The power of the "toxic" components was not strong enough to overcome the "protective" canponents in the small studies.  After adjusting for all the standard risk factors, type A behavior is related to coronary heart disease (CHD) only in people 55 years of age or younger. This is true for females as well as males but men are at a higher CHD risk. Dr. Williams said this age effect was there no matter how one looks at the data. He also said that global type A at sufficient power is related to CHD, and asked if biologically-vulnerable types A's died earlier and did not live long enough for the effect of type A behavior to be seen after age 55.  Looking at the components of type A behavior is the next step and all agreed that type A's have a potential for hostility. (It was also noted that type B's with CHD exhibit same characteristics of type A behavior, but not enough to be called type A's.) Another characteristic is the repression of anger. Those who express their anger do not have an increased amount of CHD. It was also noted that all risk factors get weaker as age increases. The sug- gestion was made that if population samples aged 45 years or over are em ployed, these people may be too old for the effect of many risk factors to be seen.  Another factor to be considered is that a lot of type A behavior may be determined by the sympathetic nervous system. Increased levels of cortisone, norepinephrine, and testosterone have been observed in type A's. Using these hormones, Dr. Williams is going to see if he can produce atherosclerosis in the Egyptian sand rat by chronically creating the type A hormonal milieu.!  Dc. Theodore M. Denbroeki (University of Maryland) discussed hostility and CAD. He said that global type A behavior is primarily characterized by loud, explosive, rapid speech, i.e.,; a vigorous voice style, and hostile peo- ple are more likely to speak this way. Some 80-85% of type A's exhibit explo- sive speech. Dr. Denbroski noted that Rosenman in his Western Collaborative Group Study found a ratio of type A's to type B's of approximately 50/50. However later studies, including MRFIT, have had ratios closer to 75/25. He questioned whether there had been a shift over time of investigators looking primarily at vigorous speech characteristics.  1 The rat is not a good model for atherosclerosis. However, Dr. Williams said that this particular rat, a desert animal, develops atherosclerosis readily when fed a normal diet. Dr. James Blumenthal, also from Duke, told me Dr.  - Williams was also going to use miniature swine, which is a good model.  LES6 ETHOS
__label__6 UPHOLSTERED  FURNITURE ACTION COUNCIL : Box 2436 cM  High Point, NC 27261 (819) 835-5065  FABRIC CLASSIFICATION TEST METHOD--1990  I. BACKGROUND  To participate in the UFAC Voluntary Action Progran, upholstered furniture manufacturers must agree to produce their furniture in accordance with the basic UFAC construction criteria. In order to identify component materials which meet the UFAC requirements, a test method is needed to define acceptable performance in each criterion.  II. SCOPE  This test method is intended as the means of establishing the performance level of upholstery cover fabrics in contact with polyurethane foam with respect toe cigarette ignition resistance. Fabrics which meet the requirements of this test method may be labelled as UFPAC Class I, and may be used directly over conventional polyurethane in the horizontal seating surfaces of upholstered furniture bearing the UFAC hangtag. All other fabrics are UFAC Class II and require an approved barrier between the cover fabric and conventional polyurethane foam in the horizontal Seating surfaces.  ITI. GENERAL PROCEDURE  Vertical and horizontal panels of two inch UPAC Standard Polyurethane Foam substrate are covered, using the fabric to be tested. The panels are placed in three specimen holders and a lighted cigarette is placed in each crevice formed by the abutment of vertical and horizontal panels of each assembly. Each cigarette is covered with a piece of sheeting fabric. The cigarettes are allowed to burn their entire length, unless an obvious ignition occurs. Test measurements and observations are recorded.

__label__6 . oh eg Ke Asi v9 “8  Abhication # s4uy  peterres For ssfe Wiel Abel lee  Critique of Busbee Application  The staff, Dv, Brennan and I met Dr. Busbee during the meeting of the CTR in June 1982 where he presented his data.  In principle, the work is concerned with the transport of aromatic hydrocarbons (H3) carcinogen by serum components. In addition, the importance of binding  of lipofilic carcinogens by lipoproteins and their uptake is being explored. It was therefore logical for Dr. Busbee to suggest a correlation between LP and the action of carcinogens. Not, so logical is his invocation of carcinogen-initiated hypeplastic growth of cells and human atherosclerosis. In this connection he quotes (in reference 7) Benditt, who has demonstrated the tumor-like growth of smooth muscle cells, but who never mentioned any connection with lipofilic carcinogens. This connection is most tenuous.  It is also natural for Dr. Busbee to invoke the work of Goldstein on LDL receptors.  He attempts to demonstrate the close connection between transport of carcinogen (PAH) by lipoproteins; and the initiation of DNA synthesis in treated cells.  TECHNIQUE:  The lipoprotein preparation is quite interesting because  he uses a method which he claims is new and more simple  than others and that is the TSK-250 column which originated in Japan. I have no experience with this column, since  most peonle use differential ultra-centrifugation or heparin- Manganese methods. The binding of LDL with benzopyrene  which is labeled is investigated. A further step, of course, is the binding of carcinogens to cellular components. He uses human lymphocytes in this connection.  The last step is an investigation of carcinogen binding of lymphocytes to DNA, and the incorporation of tritiated thinidin into lymphocytes.  In principle, therefore, the investigation consists in isolation of low density lipoprotein, demonstration of binding of the carcinogen and the effect of this binding complex to the uptake and effect on DNA synthesis in the cell.
__label__6 Research Department  MEMORANDUM September 2, 1971  NEW_IMPACT STANDARDS /715 MEV LoD  A new series of impact standards has been developed and recently reported by R&DE, Southampton(!), Although the Southampton approach was expected to be an improvemant over the chemical standards, we felt that BéW's needs would still not be met by these new standards. Consequently, we have been pursuing the development of our own series. Preliminary results are quite encouraging.  This memo covers my comments on the Southampton Report and the status of our developmental work.  O6-R      Ad Comments on R&DE Report Ri  Jeremy Wood's report contains several points of immediate importance in view of on-going WOODROSE activities and current R&D projects.  1. The new series of nine impact standards are designed to give more precise determinations than the previous standards, covering the same impact sensation range (0 to 4 is now 1 to 9).  2. The filter cigarettes are available from R&DE and Wood makes the recommendation that the new standards be used by all panels using WOODROSE .  3. Very casually in passing, Wood makes the comment that impact "should be based on the whole cigarette and not merely on the first few puffs." This is news to me.     The new series is based on the relationship between extractable nicotine delivery and impact. The desired levels of impact sensation are produced by blends of two flue-cured tobaccos, widely differing in nicotine concent, in proportions to yield theoretical nicotine deliveries, which give just noticeable differences (j.n.d.) in impact. Calculations for the tobacco blend formulations are based on the theory that the difference between two stimuli is what is important in determining j.n.d. and net absolute values,  The impact standards, identified as IMP/1, IMP/2...IMP/9, were evaluated by “blind” panel testing. Ten members scored, by the old scale, adjacent pairs from memory, i.e., no standards were used. The panel average re- sults ranged from 0.56 for IMP/1 to 3.50 for IMP/9 with all samples falling in the "carrect" sequence. However, for three of the adjacent pairs,        Diooe, D.

The main objective of the study is to investigate the relationship between type of cigarette smoked and the incidence of four different index diseases - lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, For each index disease, the objective was to obtain interviews of 200 cases and 200 controls in each of 8 age/sex Categories (male or female x age 35-44, 45-54, 55-64 or 65-74), giving a total target of 12,800 interviews though it was realised that for some combinations (e.g. young female chronic bronchitics) it would not be practicable to achieve the target. All interviews are.

__label__6 6.  > 5. "Cigarette smoking and UDL cholesterol: the Fram- ingham Offspring Study" -- R. J. Garrison, Framingham. This study dealt with the relation of cigarette smoking to high density lipoproteins (IDL), high levels of which are con- Sidered a protective factor in C]HD,:in 2449 females and 1958 males aged 20-49. Adjustment was made for obesity and alco- hol intake. The subjects were part of the Framingham Off- spring Study, itself a part of the overall Framinham Heart Study.  Cigarette smoking was found to decrease HDL in smokers who drank little or no alcohol. Former cigarette smokers (off cigarettes at least a year) and cigar or pipe smokers who had never smoked cigarettes had HDL comparable to those of nonsmokers. Cigarette exposure appears directly related to HDL level.  The data suggest another explanation for the association of cigarette smoking with atherosclerosis. "If, indeed, cig- arette smoking aggravates atherosclerosis by lowering HDL levels, then the question of whether cessation of smoking and return to higher NDL levels leads to remission of ath- \ Smoneneness needs attention."  6. "Influence of cigarette smoking on the natural his- tory of coronary artery disease" ~- Thomas Gaardcr, Downey, Cal. In a poster session, Gaarder reported a study in which progressive obstructive artery disease (POD) was measured in 135 men and women by coronary arteriography 10-54 months after initial examination. POD, defined as any increase in obstruction greather than 25%, occurred in 54 patients; of these 43 went on to total occlusion.  POD relative to the presence of single (i1VD), double (2VD) or triple (3VD) vessel disease was measured at four time intervals. The effect of blood sugar, lipids, blood pressure, and cigarette smoking on POD also was analyzed at each time interval in the 2VD and 3VD groups. The most significant factor related to POD at each time interval was smoking. The 2VD and 3VD groups showed rapid POD; that in 1VD was much less. It was concluded that smoking had a sig- nificant adverse effect on coronary change.  7.

Finally, Dr. Selikoff, a physician with extensive experience with the asbestos problem, will be a participant in the study through the provision of follov-up, presumably over a long perlod of time, on the subjects so that any correlation between asbestos associated lung disease and AHK fnducibl lity might be determined.

D. Alford P DATE: November 20, 1987  cc; M. L. Reynolds, T. F. Riehl, C. N. Kounnas, A. MeMurtrie, D. V. Cantrell, J. o. Lauterbach,-J. F. Nall, W. H. Deines, R. R. Johnson, E. F. Litzinger, D. A. Colby, W. R. Conway, R. A, Marshall  ATION  SUMMARY  ‘The paper recons from Marlboro KS and Marlboro Menthol Lights 100‘s were found to be different. The paper recon from Marlboro KS contained DAP and therefore exhibited the sugar-ammonia products. The Marlboro Menthol Lights 100's paper recon did not contain phosphate in excess of the level typically found in PJS where no DAP was added. Therefore, the levels of the sugar-asmonia Progucts were much lower (80-852) in the paper recon from Marlboro Menthol Lights 100‘s.  2 ~ Y < = S        Tt has not been proven, but the furnish for the two paper recon are also thought to be different. The furnish for the paper recon found in Marlboro KS was thought to be heavily skewed towarg burley while, the furnish for the Marlboro Menthol Lights 100’s was thought to be skewed toward Elue-cured furnish.  A comparison of the paper and dark recons from Marlboro KU were also made. This comparison showed that paper recon exhibited most of the sugar-amponia reaction products found in the dark recon and in about the eame quantities. The major differences were found in the wlatile alkyl pyrazines region of the P&T profiles.  ‘ONFIDENTIAL MINNESOT,  €  e > INTRODUCTION  Bob Jobnaon bad isolated the paper recon from Marlboro KS and Marlboro  Wenthol Lights 100's. These materials, along with the dark recon from 8 Marlboro KS, were examined by purge-and-trap (P&T) and direct  silylation (DS) GC-MS. The combination of both of these analyses  showed the volatiles from the alkylpyrazines to deoxyfructosazine and » fructosazines, Data from both of the analyses were used to reach the conclusions drawn in this file note.  812 76066

__label__6 SMOKING RESTRICTIONS: THE HIODEN THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH  By Gray Robertson President, ACVA Atlantic, Inc.  Ban smoking.  It's the instant solution to indoor air pollution. Right? No more sore and watery eyes, headaches, mysterious bouts of allergies and asthma, scratchy throats, coughing or other respiratory problems. And best of all, no more worries about chronic health problems from the air you breathe. Right? . .  Wrong. H.L. Mencken might have been anticipating today's debate about  smoking on the job and in public places when he wrote: “For every problem there is a solution that is simple, neat -- and wrong." The truth is that reducing or eliminating smoking in the workplace is no solution to the problem of indoor air pollution,  When it comes to poor indoor air quality, tobacco smoke appears to be among the least of our worries. New reports by federal and private experts show that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) may be the primary cause of indoor air pollution in as few as 2 percent of all cases,. And that means Kansas City lawmakers will accomplish little or nothing even if they succeed in removing every last wisp of tobacco smoke in the workplace. Complaints of health problems and irritations will persist. We now know that the vast majority of these reports are unrelated to cigarette smoke.  How much of the blame now heaped on ETS is misplaced? The government's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) reports that of the 203 major indoor air quality complaints, it examined recently, just four cases -~-- or 2 percent -- were attributable to cigarette smoking. My own independent firm, ACVA Atlantic, Inc., has inspected more than 27 million square feet of office space in 125 major private and public buildings, including the U.S. Supreme Court and the main Federal Reserve Bank. Tobacco smoke was identified as the major contributing factor to air quality problems in only five of those buildings.  These consistent findings make it increasingly clear that tobacco smoke is blamed for-poor indoor air quality simply because it is one of the few indoor air factors that we can see and smell. But high levels of ETS are nothing more than a symptom of poorly maintained and designed ventilation systems. While NIOSH identified ETS as the problem in a tiny handful of instances, inadequate ventilation was btamed in 50 percent of them. ACVA investigations show improper attention to indoor air circulation was responsible in the majority of cases for the spread and breeding of infectious germs and allergenic dusts and spores ~-- not to mention fiberglass particles, asbestos, chemical fumes and a host of other hazardous airborne particles undetectable to the eye and nose.  €Cé98 sEncs

APR 28 95 0744 READ-POLAND/214/768-6867  Monday, April 3, 1995        Risk of infant (S.. that no smoke is safe smoke |  Anti-abortion activists concerned with the well- being of fetuses should per- haps start supporting anoth: § ef group of protesters — the opponents of secondhand § smoke.  Roughly one-fourth of 4 American women smoke TOM while pregnant, and perhaps SJE QFRIED as Many as half of nonsmok- ing pregnant women are exposed to the smoke of others. Nicotine from this smoke makes its way to the fetus, and medical researchers have document- ed several damaging consequences. Nicotine expo- sure has been linked to a higher rate of spontaneous abortions, lower birth weights and a higher rate of attention deficit disorder.  Furthermore, a study published this month found a substantial increase in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (commonly known as “crib death”) among infants exposed to smoke before birth.  SIDS kills more than 5,000 babies per year in the United States; more babies between the age of 1 month and 1 year die of SIDS than from any other cause. The causes of crib death have long been mysterious — and in fact, part of the definition of SIDS is that the death is unexplained. But while the  "unknown causes of SIDS aren’t likely to be simple, cigarette smoke seems to be a factor.  Smoking by mothers, fathers or other people in the same room with a baby greatly increases the crib death risk, researchers from the University of Cali- fornia, San Diego, reported last month in the Jour- nal of the American Medical Association.  “The greater the total number of cigarettes the infant was passively exposed to after birth from all adults, the higher the risk of SIDS,” wrote Hillary Sandra Klonoff-Cohen and colleagues.  Furthermore, smoke raises the risk of SIDS even when the exposure comes before birth. When fa- thers smoked in the presence of a nonsmoking mother during pregnancy, for example, the risk of infant crib death more than tripled. If the mother smoked during pregnancy, the risk wag even great- er, the researchers found.  Of course, such research represents only an in- dictment of cigarette smoke as a baby killer and not yet a conviction, for a correlation is not proof of a cause-and-effect relationship. Still, other research has begun to show evidence of how nicotine might do direct damage to the developing fetal brain.  In a recent issue of the journal Developmental               Tbedaltas orig Nang  death suggests     Brain Research, Stanford University scientists fe: |. ported that prenatal nicotine exposure can’altels activity in the part of the brain responsibje for maintaining the biological clock. eee  Biological clocks are the pacemakers of life? poets lating various. bodily functions including slebp‘oy--. cles and body temperature. In mammals the biologi. cal clock is under the control of a small clunip.of: brain cells called the suprachiasmatic nucleus? >. -s  Studying laboratory rats, the Stanford restatcli-: ers injected mothers-to-bé with nicotine and’ then, examined resulting changes in brain processés in‘ both the mother and fetuses. (Comparisons; were~ made to a group of rats injected with saling séld~. tion.) Nicotine caused several changes in brain’ac-+ tivity, and for the most part the changes werd the? same in mother rat and babies-to-be. :  In the last few days before birth, however,. nico- tine induced a change in the fetuses’ suprachiasma- tic nuclei, though not in the mothers’. The change was the switching into sction of a particular gene known as c-fos. Among other things, c-fos plays an important role in the regulation of circadian. rhythms — the daily rhythms of the biological’ - clock. So by altering c-fos activity, nicotine likely gave the fetal rats an artificial form of jety Jag, .|-     8  9D-     Ww     throwing the circadian rhythm of mothers and;ba--:) "  bies out of sync.  “If nicotinic ... stimulation in the fetus has an effect on the biological clock, there could be poten-.-. tially damaging effects,”"Thomas Kilduff and col-: leagues wrote. Interference with circadian rhythms'- might throw off the normal process of mother-child’. bonding, for example.  “It is possible that the increased incidence of" Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. and. Attention | Defi- cit Disorders in the offspring of maternal smokers . may be related to this very mechanism,” the Stan-.. ford scientists speculated.  It may be no coineldence, the researchers” suge gest, that the peak period of SIDS desths — in infants 2 to 4 months old — corresponds to a time when the . babies’ circadian rhythm cycles are being eataby. lished.  More research is needed to pin down the possible aks between smoke, circadian rhythms and’ SIDS. But results so far clearly suggest that the dangers of’ secondhand smoke may go far beyond a small Statis-' tical increase in the Hkelihood of lung cancer.

__label__6 FASEB Feature Service July 1979 Page 12  CiGaReTTE SMOKE INHIBITS PROTEIN SYNTHESIS  The body's ability to manufacture proteins; a function which is absolutely essential to many life processes, appears to be affected by cigarette smoke, according to research published in the May, 1979 issue of The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.  University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy researchers Ruby J.B. Garrett, PhD, and M.A. Jackson have found that cigarette smoke inhibits protein synthesis in ’ the livers of experimental rats. Carbon moncxide, the investigators speculated, may be the smoke component responsible for this inhibition, altering protein synthesis by directly interfering with the protein synthesizing machinery or by reducing oxygen levels in the cell to such an extent that the energy molecules needed to drive protein synthesis camot be produced. .  Dr. Garrett is a member of The American Physiological Society, part of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.  A number of recent studies have shown that smokers and nonsmokers react differently to many drugs. One reason may be increased drug metabolism in cigarette smokers caused by the induction of special drug-metabolizing enzymes after chronic exposure to cigarette smoke.  Some investigators have shown that enzyme induction is related to protein synthesis. With this in mind, the Kentucky researchers set out to deternine the inmediate effect of acute smoke exposure on protein synthesis.  The experiments were carried out on laboratory rats exposed to either 15 or 60 puffs of cigarette smoke at a rate of one puff per minute. A “gingle-port reverse smoking machine"' was used to generate puffs similar to those normally  (more)  Qin 12215

The stimulation from nicotine in tobacco is the main reason that 60 milifon Americans smoke  Numerous other chemicals are present in tobacco suoke, and it ds the interrelationship of a these constituents that provides the total pleasure derived from smoking. But nicotine is  component which provides the physiological stimulation that makes a person a compulsive smoker,  ae renacely, the Surgeon General's report on tobacco and health gave nicotine a clean bili of health,  Tobacco manufacturers regulate the level of nicotine in their products very closely. Costs of tobacce going into a Product and nicotine level of the final product receive top attenti as cigarettes are made. Over a period af time the percentage of nicotine in Products may vary, but abrupt changes are avoided. Usually it takes a 15% to 20% change for a signifi~ cant part of the public ta detect it. Nevertheless, it's taboo within the industry to make unnecessary changes.     The nicotine level in most best selling cigarettes is currently somewhere between 1.5% and 2%. Some cigarettes are available with much less nicotine, with 28% of the market in 1977 considered low nicotine. ligh-nicotine cigarettes also fail te attract and keep many smokers. The lack of nicotine in so-called no-nicotine cigarettes has surely played a major role in the downfall of these products.  There's a definite correlation between the level of n&atine in tobacco and its aroma or Pleasing qualities during combustion. Low-nicotine tobaccos usually are weak flavored, Migh-nicotine tobaccos are too strong for most American smokers. When our forefathers ce: to this country they found the Indians smoking high=nicotine (about 10%) tobaccos, The tobaccos vere simply too strong for our people.     “Blending" is the main method used by manufacturers to regulate the desired nicotine level in tobacco products, The basic blend of our cigarettes is composed of four classes of tebacco, each of which has distinct properties. In 1976 the average percentage of each class of tobacco used in cigarettes was: flue-cured, 46%, Burley, 347; Maryland, .22; and imported, 18%. :  Nicotine contributed by the flue-cured portion of the blrad is controlled by using tobacco grown in different years, fron different production areas of the Belt, and from different Stalk positions, Nicotine content of tobacco grown in differcnt years and production areas vaties considerably, It's mainly related to rainfall.  Most of the 60 species of tobacco are very low in nicotine, (We'll define a species as a group of freely interbreeding plants.) Nicotine can be artificially produced, but ta date this process has been cost prohibitive fer commercial use. Kovever, efforts by private companies are currently underway to make synthetic cigarettes with nicotine added,     Buying patterns of companies are influenced by the levels of nicotine of tobacco in inventory as weli as of what is being purchased.

__label__6 | HK#C916039 Iv. INITIATING VERSUS DEVELOPMENTAL INFLUENCES  General Comments  It is obviously difficult to separate influences on the initiation of cardiovascular diseases and tnose which affect the development of such diseases once they are established.  This is especially true where recognition and classification of the disease occur only after other symptoms exist, as is usually the case.  As might be expected, there is no hard and fast rule or universally consistent clinical opinion on this matter. It is clear that individuals differ in response to smoking and to their deprivation from the habit.  Further research may conceivably indicate that a sufficiently high percentage of those with established degrees of cardiovascular disorders will react so unfavorably to smoking as to justify medical advice on certain coursed of restrictive action. This, however, is properly a matter of relationship between the individual doctor and his patient. The desired situation is one which will involve es broad and comprehensive knowledge as can possibly be acquired to guide the profession in the light of its clinical experience.  The references appended will present opinions which are based on such experience. They should be considered as being contributory rather than conclusive and as being selected for purposes of comparison.  The important point is that more refined and sophisticated longitudinal studies of controlled populations of apparently normal individuals are sorely needed. These should aid in refining our recognition of departures from normalcy which represent the earliest evidence of the diseases under study and which, therefore, may be closely connected with their origin.  Similarly, manipulable populations of patients with established early cardiovascular diseases should provide material for more sophisticated clinical studies of factors which may influence the progress and course of these diseases.  Until such studies are organized and bear fruit we shall have to be content with a type of evidence which leaves doubt as to whether we are dealing with factors which influence origin alone, progressive development alone, or both.  Ocular, Cerebral and Other Peripheral Circulation  According to Bettman, Fellows, et al., the effect of cigarette smoking on intraocular blood volume in man is net known. ‘They have, therefore, used animals for experimentation.  If the cigarette was smoked at the normal rate there was no effect. If it was smoked rapidly there was a significant rise in intraocular volume. Denicotinized cigarettes gave generally similar results.

BLAKESLEE  NEW . YORK’ —(2)— A broad study seeking knowledge of whether cigarets or other forms of tobacco cause lung cancer or other health hazards was an- nounced Tuesday  It is the first announcement of a big research program head- ed by the scientific advisory board of the Tobacco Indus Research committee, .  IT WILL INCLUDE numer ous studies of humans, includ- ing emotional habits of smok- ers, as well as tests on animals.  Only the broad aspects of the Tesearch program were dis- closed yesterday. Specific re. search grants will be announced later. The board has $500,000 to work with.  “We will tackle simultane. ously many of the unknowns in this field of tobacco use in re- lation to human health,” said Dr. Clarence Cook Little, Bar Harbor, Maine, chairman of the research board.  Statisticat studies and experi- menis recently linked smoking, especially cigarets, with a rapid rise in human lung cancer. Ciga- rets also have been charged with creating an ‘extra hazard of causing heart attacks,  BUT SOME sscienlisis. and physicians have said they are by no means convinced, or doubt there is any link.  Little’s board said it will co- ordinate research in these six gentral areas:  A study of human lung can- cer in 10 major medical centers in the United States and Can- ada, checking lungs for evi- dences of the sites and time of beginning of cancer.  Study of animals while inhal- ing smoke under controlled conditions, to see if there are effects on lung cancer, growth rates, heart and blood vessels, and nervous tissues.  Study of the effect of known smoke tars, obtained under con- trolled conditions, on tissues of animals which naturally vary in their susceptibility to cancer or other diseases.  Study of lung cardiovascular (heart-blood vessel) tissues in living humans and animals.  Surveys of groups of people in various parts of the nation concerning characteristics of smokers. Age, sex, emotional habits, environmental factors as well as smoking histories will be analyzed.

It is the first announcement of a big research program head- ed by the scientific advisory board of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee (TIRC).  It will include numerous studies of humans, including emotional habits of smokera, as well as tests on animals,  Only the main broad aspects of the research were disclosed. The specific research grants, fi- maced by the TIRC, will be an- nounced later.  “We will tackle simultaneous- ly many of the unknowns in this field of tobacco use in re- lation to human health,” said Dr. Clarence Cook Little, Bar Harbor, Me., board chairman.  “We seek definitive findings in an area where much sug- gestive work has been done. The program recognizes we do not have today the experiment- al evidence that will permit scientific conclusions regarding the cause and effect relationship between environmental factors, including smoking, and lung cancer.”  One researcher who linked cancer with cigaret smoking, meanwhile, recommended that the cigaret industry try to pro- auce a “safe” cigaret, rather than undertake the “nearly im- possible task of proving con- clusively” whether smoking is a factor in cancer or heart disease.  He is Dr. E. Cuyler Ham- mond, statistical director of the American Cancer Society. Addressing the ACS annual meeting, he said there is “hope” of producing a “safe” cigaret. It will take far longer to define cigaret smoking’s effects on the body than fo produce a tobacco which can be shown to have less harmful effect on respira- tion and heartbeat, he said,

__label__6 r 4  BRIGHT CONSUMER TRACKING AMONG BLACK SMOKERS  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  BACKGROUND  BRIGHT is an innovative low tar 85mm/100mm cigarette positioned primarily against menthol smokers. It is designed to deliver a unique new taste which is fresher during smoking and leaves a clean fresh aftertaste. BRIGHT entered test market in Michigan, Oklahoma, and Colorado on July 5, 1982.  Pre-market research has suggested that Black menthol smokers represent a potential incremental share opportunity for the Brand. As a part of the test market research program developed for BRIGHT, the awareness, trial, purchase and repeat purchase levels for BRIGHT were tracked among Black menthol smokers in the Detroit Metro area. The acceptance and penetration levels of BRIGHT  among these smokers should provide direction for possible modification of the Brand's national marketing plan.  CONCLUSIONS  Sampling was the most important source of initial brand awareness and trial for BRIGHT among Black smokers. Sampling may be particularly  important in generating trial among Blacks in economically depressed areas.  Trial was effectively converted into purchase of the Brand. By week fourteen, over one-half of all Black menthol smokers who had ever tried BRIGHT had also purchased it. Repeat purchase averaged 37% over the three tracking periods and appeared to be fairly stable over time. The appeal of the BRIGHT proposition was strongest among females, smokers aged 25-34, and those earning less than $15,000.  BRIGHT's unique taste appeared to result in polarized perceptions among Black triers. The attributes most strongly liked were also most strongly disliked, which supports other research results.  gest 92105  -1-
__label__1 IL O88  eLS-HRDETTE  PRPAIGR. JL ae ue fa ($)62.346  Je 6     Emerson Fittipaldi, right, showers Michaef Andretti with champagne. Andretti put a stop to a seven-race winning streak by Fittipaldi’s Penske team Sunday.  Andretti puts an end to Penske win streak  By The Associated Preas  Michael Andretti hopes a turnaround for his season came along with a domi- nating victory Sunday in-the Toronto Molson-Indy.  If it did, though, Andretti says the reason is probably off the track, where Chip Ganassl Racing recently signed veteran IndyCar engineer Mo Nunn to help get things sorted out.  Whatever made the difference, though, the 31-year-old Andretti was able to outrace a variety of troubles Sunday to end Team Penske’s seven- race winning streak and earn his fourth Toronto victory.  Andretti, whose best finish since an opening-day victory in Australia was fourth place last month at Milwaukee, took control after bumping and passing Nigel Mansell for the lead on lap 26 as the defending series champion’s right- rear tire deflated.  “I was staying right on Nigel,” Andret- ti explained, “I tried to get past him once and almost wound up in a tire barrier, Then I tapped him a little and just got by him a few turns later. I didn’t know he was having any problem with his tlre. 1 didn’t see that.”  Andretti was virtually unchallenged the rest of the 98-lap, 174.44-mile race, beating Bobby Rahal to the finish by 6.8 seconds in earning his 29th career Indy- Car victory.  “This is a big win for us,” Andretti said. “We started out on a real high with the win in Australia, then every- thing went downhill. It seemed the harder we worked, the slower the car would go.  “We needed a change and we were     Auto racing roundup  fortunate that Mo Nunn left Simon Rac- ing (last month), We went out and got Mo to work with Julian Robertson, my engineer all year long. They make a super team. Hopefully, we're on the way.”  Nunn was the chief engineer for Em- erson Fittipadli in his championship season of 1989,  Miller 500  Geoff Bodine kept insisting that Hoo- Stier tires would withstand the rigors of & long race, and proved it with what amounted to a Sunday drive in the Mill- er Genuine Draft 500 at Long Pond, Pa.  The victory at Pocono International Raceway was the first this year for the Indiana-based race tire manufacturer, Cars running on the Goodyear brand had won the first 16 races on the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit.  “You're going to see a lot more Hao- sler cars in Victory Lane this year,” Bodine said. “We're proud of what (Hoo- sier president) Bob Newton and his peo- ple have done.”  Bodine, who won the pole in a Ford Thunderbird with a speed of 163.689 mph, led 156 of 200 laps and beat Ward Burton by 1.26 seconds for his first vic- tory this season. It was the 14th win of Bodine's career.  Indy Lights Steve Robertson of England extended his point lead in the Firestone Indy Lights racing series with a victory at the Toronto Molson-Indy. te  6P908Zes0z
__label__1 -19-  APR 19 196  t THE NEW YORK TIMES, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 19, 1995  Black Teeti-Agers Are Turning Away From Smoking, but Whites Puff On     By PHILIP J. HILTS  ASHINGTON, April 18 - African-American teen-agers have large- ly eliminated smoking  from their lives, while white teen- agers are still taking up the habit at high rates, according to a study re- ported in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute.     “This is the singte most interest-  ing change in the use of tobacco in years: the success of black teens,” said Dr. Michael Eriksen, chief of the Office on Smoking and Health at . the Federal Centers for Disease Con- trol and Prevention in Atlanta. “We'd like to bottle it and get it to  others, but we haven't figured out  how to do that yet.”  The trend is striking:  In 1976, Federal surveys of thou- sands of high school seniors around the country showed that both black and white teen-agers smoked at rela- tively high rates: 28.8 percent of whites smoked one or more ciga-  rettes a day in the 30 days before the’  interviews, while 26.8 percent of black teen-agers did so.  But by 1993, only 4.4 percent of black teen-agers took up regular smoking, according to the Institute for Social Research at the Universi- ty of Michigan, which conducts the  annual surveys for the Government. |  Among whites, the figures remains high, at 229 percent in 1993, the highest it has been since the late 1970's.  According to an article being pub- lished on Wednesday in cancer insti- tute journal, the change is not be- cause of higher cigarette prices or because the teen-agers are using other drugs, but iste to a change in attitude and social norms, said Dr. Sherry Mills, an epidemiologist who conducted group discussions with two dozen white and black teen- agers in each of five cities to deter- mine what was behind the trend. The focus groups met in Los Angeies, Washington, New Orleans, Kansas           How Teoon-Agers Have Changed  Percentage of high schoo! seniors wno smoked one or more cigarettes a day in the previous 30 days.

Dr. Mills wrote in the jaurnai that family and community pressures were persuading young African- Americans not to smoke. For exam- ple, there is a belief that. cigarerte makers are targeting blacks. Refus- ing tc smoke is part of the reaction. Black parents are firm in telling their children nor to smoke, and black teen-agers have aiso changed their idea of a good time, Dr. Mills said.  - “Whereas black kids will go to a party to dance and mingle, white kids definitely will go — and this is their self-reporting — to drink beer and smoke cigarettes. Black kids just don’t see that as fun.”  _ Dr. Eriksen of the disease-controi agency said: ‘We have ‘looked at many possible explanations for it.

The lower rate among blacks also is not explained by use of other drugs ‘instead of smoking, because black teen-agers have also decreased their use of other drugs, including mari-  juana, alcohol and cocaine, Dr. Erik-.  sen. . He explained: “Blacks seem to be  . turning off the message from ciga-  rette companies that smoking is cool. For blacks, it no longer pro- vides that function. You hear black teens saying smoking’s a white thing.”  He noted that white rock groups and performers like Brad Pitt, Wino- na Ryder and Johnny Depp, contin- ued to glamorize smoking, while biack performers did not.  “Over ail, we are very depressed about teen smoking because we have made no progress over the last 10 years,” he said. “The only bright spot is the black teens. It shows us that we shouldn't be satisfied with more than 20 percent of teens smok- ing. A significant portion of the popu- lation has already got it under 5 percent.” . :  GE6SEGSITNG  er RR TEN
__label__6 THE MEASUREMENTS OF NICOTINE INTRAPUFF DELIVERY  Evon L. Crooks Dwo Lynm  Research and Development Bowman Gray Technical Center R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company Winston-Salem North Carolina 27102.  SUMMARY GE  Time resolved measurements of intrapuff nicotine delivery in mainstream smoke have been performed with a specially designed intrapuff smoking apparatus (IPSA). The IPSA-filter traversing mechanism collects mainstream particulates on a rectangular filter pad which moves at a constant velocity perpendicular to the direction of smoke flow at the mouth end of the cigarette. Filter pads were assayed by two analytical : techniques. Standard gas chromatographic (GC) methodology was used to quantitate nicotine concentration in five equal time segments per puff.” A second method, using a Berthold TLC- Linear Analyzer, measured total radioactivity across the pad for 14C-nicotine labelled cigarettes.  Intrapuff nicotine concentrations were determined from measured puff flow profiles and the collected masses of nicotine on the filters. GC nicotine concentration measurements correlated well with total activity from the scanner measurements. Studies carried out with full- Flavor cigarettes revealed that nicotine concentrations in the smoke vary significantly during a puff. .- -  This work provides a new technique for studying time-resolved delivery of mainstream smoke components. It may also be used to elucidate  mechanisms controlling the delivery of nicotine and other mainstream smoke components.  INTRODUCTION  It has become increasingly important to better understand the  - mechanisms by which smoke components, (especially nicotine) are delivered  to mainstream smoke. To this end, instrumentation was developed to make time- resolved measurements of mainstream smoke components during  - individual puffs. Central to the function of IPSA is a means of measuring  puff flow- rate profiles accurately. The method for measuring puff profiles was a modification of that reported by Reynolds (1).  ~The absence of these types of measurements in the literature is testimony to evidence for their difficulty. For example, Ceschini (3)  reported the evolution of gas-vapour phase and total particulate matter  6986 6580S
__label__1 REVIEW & OUTLOOK Rethinking Risk     When the new Republican Con- gress convenes in January, one of the top priorities ought to be relling back what Lamar Alexander calls the “Waxman State’’—the torrent of rues and reguiations enacted into law by the likes of Congressman Henry Wax- man (D., Hollywood}. This is an espe- cially pressing priority in the environ- mental arena, where Congress and various executive branch agencies have spent years passing onerous rules to deal with negligible or nonex- istent risks.  Environmental regulation is the source of much public outrage nowa- days. Often the rules are a tangled meéss because Congress's underlying  legisiation vas complex in its goals °  and impossibly vague in how to meet those goals. The real rule-making was left to the bureaucracies, which in (urn produced their own Rube Gold- bergian complexity. Now comes evi- dence from a most unlikely source— the government itself~to support the contention that environmental spend- ing bears little if any relation to the real risks faced dy the public.  —» The Department of Energy has  just released a report titled ‘“‘Choices in Risk Assessment,’ prepared by a Nonprofit Teseareh group. The agency has good reason to study the subject: It could spend $300 billion to S1 trillion over the next 36 years cleaning up waste sites. Does the sci- entific policy behind those cleanups— and other federal actions—stand up to scrutiny?  The report delivers some clear an- swers: ‘Most environmental risks are so smail or indistinguishable that their existence cannot be proven,” Scientific policy is “inherently biased and can be designed to achieve prede- términed regulatory outcomes.'’ “‘Pol- i¢ymakers, the media and the public are unaware of the role of science pol- iey because of a lack of full and fair @sclosure.”"  * Consider just one example: the Oc- cupational Safety and Eealth Admin- istration is now proposing sweeping indoor air-quality regulations that would inciude a ban on all workplace smoking. But according to “Choices,"* a-major part of this policy—estimated to.cost the private sector $8 billion an- oally—is based on a one-page, hand- written chart that has never been pub- lished or peer-reviewed.  The “Chaices'' report praises the government for not banning the fluo-  ridation of water, unleaded gasoline ! and used oil. for which some evidence | of risk exists, but which on balance do far more good than harm, The report asks why similar decisions haven’t been reached about other alleged dan- gers. For example, when the EPA tried to ban asbestos, it took into ac- count only the product’s hypothetical! cancer risk—not the many lives that would be lost if nonasbestos brakes are substituted on cars,  There's simply no rhyme or reason behind federal environmental policy. Even the ‘‘one chance in a million” standard used by many agencies to define a minimum level of cancer risk tums out to have no scientific basis. Kathryn Kelly, a Seattle environmen-     tal consultant, reports in the newslet- ter EPA Watch that this standard was basically plucked out of a hat by the FDA in the 1970s to regulate animal drug residues. Now it's employed for everything from hazardous waste sites to pesticides—even though scien- tists have generaily concluded that risks of Iess than one in a thousand  can’t even be quantified. i  ‘It’s insane that we're spending hundreds of billions of dollars chasing imagined risks,” Steve Milloy, author of.“Choices,” tells us.  The road to sanity starts with more rational risk/cost-benefit analysis. Bills to accomplish that goal were in- troduced in the last Congress but got nowhere because of opposition from Democratic barons. Now that there are new Kings of the Hill, swift action is expected on this front.  But the new Republican majority  should be careful about the language ‘be  of cost-benefit bills. As “Choices” points out, many risk-analysis ideas have already been implemented via executive order—to no effect. What's needed ts legislation with teeth—set out clearly what standards bureau- crats should follow, and give compa- : nies and focal governments the right to sue if regulators get out of line. GOP Sen. Trent Lott. the new Majority Whip. has introduced a draft proposal along these lines, and Rep. Dan Mica (R., Fla.) will probably follow suit.  Passage of their plans would be a first step toward dismantling the crushing cost burden of the Waxman State, which surely played aroleinthe ! voters’ recent decision to part ways with the Democratic Party. The party’s public tastes simply had be- come too expensive,     LTV = $661 ‘9 UGAWAOTA ‘AVASIAL TWNUNOS LATULS VIVA DRL  o9SPOrrLoZ
__label__6 From: The Second Surgical Clinic of the University of Vienna Director: Professor Dr. W, Denk, Beitrage zur Klinischen chirurgie, Munich, 186:259-384, Nove 3, 1953.  REMARKS ON BRONCHIAL CARCINOMA by W, Denk  ‘  During the last years there have been many papers on lung cancer, It is therefore, unnecessary to review here consequently this very timely disease, In the following, we shall discuss a few aspects of the total problem and report a few observations which we have been able to make with the many patients of our Clinic.  There seems to be no question that the absolute number of bronchial cercinomata has increased, This can be further proved by a few figures, ,  Gesell reports from Switzerland that the totel mortality from cancer has almost doubled (1.8:1) from 1904 to 1948, while the mortality from lung cancer has ine creased in the same period 20,7 times, In the United States in 1920, 1.1% of all deaths due to cancer were due to a bronchial carcinoma, while in 1948 the figure was already 8.3%,  The figures for the population of the city of Vienna have been put at our dis- posal by the Central Statistical Office of the city, Total deaths due to cancer have increased from 1931 to 1938 (21 city districts) 15.3%, and from 1939 to 1951 (26 city districts), they have increased by 16.7%, The deaths from carcinoma of the respiratory system in men were 15.8% of all cancer deaths in 1931, 20.6% in 1938, and 31.76% in 1951,  For men and women together, the percentage of deaths from cancer of the respira- tory system as a percentage of the total mortality from cancer was 6.66% in 1931, 11.92% in 1938, and 17,94 in 1951, The total mortality of the population of the City of Vienna due to cancer has increased by one sixth during the last twenty years; the mortality from cancer of the respiratory system has doubled,  In 1934, 440 people died per each 100,000 inhabitants of the City of Vienna due to cancer of the respiratory system; for 1939, the figure wis 584, and for. 1951, 1,014. These figures likewise prove that there was a mch greater increase in deaths due to lung cancer when referred to the total mortality due t. cancer.  These conclusions, however, are somewhat limited by the fact that the mortality statistics do not give’as clear a picture as a morbidity statistic, which does not exist in Austria, It is certain that presently a greater number of other carcinomata than those of the lung are cured, and those naturally are not in- cluded in a mortality statistic for cancer. This arguement against the mortality statistics nevertheless, does not alter the fact of the absolute increase. How- ever, we shall not discuss these theories in detail, Here we shall discuss only the effects of cigarette smoking on bronchial carcinoma, since these relations are ar great timeliness. We shall discuss this on the basis of patients in our Clinic,     : LOLI 9BLOS

__label__6 )     |                 W. ALTON JGNeS CELLSCIERCe CENTER  Leonard FE. Benade, Ph.D. Grant #1719  Description: Dr. Benade proposes to isolate and characterize a gene which suppresses the action of the oncogene Kirsten RAS. He will do this by first isolating human cells, HOS, with two copies of RAS so that mutants which lose oncogenecity will not be due to loss of RAS. He will then look for revertants which no longer express the transformed phenotype after mutagenesis. He will partially select for such cells using oubain. Revertants are more resistant. He will check these revertants for rescuabable virus, inability to grow in agar and inability to produce tumors in nude mice. Such cells will be fused with mouse NIH 3T3 cells which have been transformed with Kirsten sarcoma virus. Hybrids with suppressed oncogenecity will be selected with oubain. Since human chromo- somes are preferentially lost in mouse-human hybrids, the suppressed cells should with time have Tess and less human DNA. Human DNA will be isolated from such cells, using alu sequences as a probe. This DNA will be used to transfect Kirsten transformed mouse cells and suppressed cells will be selected with oubain. Dr. Benade expects to eventually clone the suppressor gene.  Critique: The idea is a good one and the isolation of a gene which sup-. presses an oncogene will add greatly to our understanding of carcinogenesis. He has a very good publication record. Overlap with pending NIH application should be examined.  Recommendation: Approval - Merit A.  Ae H, Sato, oz por  50244186

"SSEE CNLY PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLAN: TO > J 3 No dS oe ROR  1.  oe CRET overview No..410 By LAU ae  The Project SPA timetable, leading to test market ~ By sat 9/29/86, is predicated upon finalizing prototype design and completing flavor approximation and test design validation by 7/15/85 with product testing commencing 8/12/85. Standard product testing methodology is judged inappropriate due to the product's unique form and the necessity to maintain Project security. Consequently, new test procedures have been established to assist R&D's development efforts and to assess product, per formance prior to market introduction. These procedures will be validated (and evaluative measures calibrated) utilizing conventional products prior to the first round of SPA product testing. A "traditional" action standard for "blind" product performance cannot be set because of product uniqueness (form and benefit) and the limitations  imposed by security requirements.  Product development efforts will concentrate on the non-menthol style since capacity constraints will probably preclude simultaneous introduction of a menthol version. However, to the extent feasible, menthol development will  parallel the non-menthol product.  8699 LOS0S

Notebook Pages: 391933-391950 e 4  Dated: August 18,1988  FATE OF 14C-LABELED PHENETHYL ISOVALERATE IN TOTAL SMOKE FROM WINSTON KS CIGARETTES  OBJECTIVES:  An objective of this study was to determine the fate, including transfer efficiencies, of phenethyl] jsovalerate in total smoke from WINSTON KS (WKS) cigarettes. A further objective was to determine the distribution of phenethyl isovalerate between tobacco rod and filter as a function of time prior to smoking.  SUMMARY:  Radiotracer studies with carbon-14 labeled phenethyl] isovalerate have been performed and show that phenethyl] isovalerate applied to tobacco rods (WKS) migrates to the filters. After 8 weeks the ratio was 35% in the filters and 65% in the rods. After 9 weeks this filter/rod ratio was 36/64 which indicated a leveling off in the migration rate. Therefore, smoking runs were begun. When smoked in the total recovery smoking apparatus ("TRSA"), 14% (88% of which was intact phenethyl isovalerate) of the total phenethyl isovalerate in the cigarette transfered to MSTPM and 25% (95% of which was intact phenethyl isovalerate) to SSTPM. Elution studies showed that only a net 10% of the phenethyl isovalerate in the filters (about 3.5% of the total in the cigarette) was delivered to MSTPM which represents 26% of the total in MSTPM. About 5% was eluted from the tobacco rods to mainstream smoke, 55% of which was removed by the filters. The unsmoked filters from the rod elution study were analysed and indicated a 40/60 phenethy] isovalerate filter/rod distribution at 10 weeks. Therefore, additional sacrifices were performed at 11 and 13 weeks and filter/rod . distributions of 45/55 were found at each time indicating another leveling in the migration rate. Data from the filtration studies indicate a 52/48 filter/rod ratio after 16-17 weeks. Equilibration may not have been reached when this study ended; however, the amount of phenethyl] isovalerate in MSTPM was constant regardless of the distribution prior to smoking. The filtration efficiency of WINSTON KS filters for phenethyl isovalerate was 44% at standard puffing conditions.  ¥  STATUS:  This work is complete. Results have been reported to the Flavor Division of Product & Applied Technology. No further work is planned.  S¢72 1OL0S
__label__6 cup  FILE norel” )y, 7?  SUBJECT: Di ions in D mber 12.  The following was agreed:  l.  A KOOL CPT needs to be put into place as soon as possible in order to gauge our recommended product against the grow- ing SALEM Lights product. Linc Lewis and Herb Woertz please liaise.  It was agreed to conduct group discussions with the younger franchise smokers in order to better evaluate current KENT films. Clearly, the smokers in the previous group discus- sions were older than the smokers who currently are going to imported American products.  It was agreed in principle to put a charcoal filter on KENT Parent King Size and Deluxe as well as raise the delivery to the 15 or 16 mg. level. Linc Lewis and Herb Woertz please make a recommendation on product.  It was agreed to introduce KENT Luxury Mild 100's in hinge lid format at Yen 250/280 in order to upgrade the image of KENT and to compete in the growing 250/280 category.  It was agreed to focus our support towards growth in the higher priced segments. Accordingly, Joel Silverstein will revise the spend plan on LUCKY STRIKE to ensure that it is optimal even if this means reducing some support on KENT.  Joel Silverstein will review the analyticals on VOGUE and CAPRI Menthol versions. There are trade reports that triers of CAPRI Menthol are returning to VOGUE Menthol, and the region believes that there may be a product difference which explains this. Prior to doing any CPT's, it is necessary to get a full analytical evaluation. Linc Lewis and Herb Woertz please do the same here and give us a view.  Joel Silverstein will prepare a plan for expansion and sup- port of CAPRI for discussion here in Louisville. It is to be here in early January.  A capital proposal will need to be developed for the sales  force software program. Joel Silverstein will have that here by the first week of January.  632000720

__label__6 Draft —- 1/25/91  P --_ I  Advertising has evolved through the centuries from a simple tool of commerce to a vital and visible part of our culture. From handbills to television to blimps, advertisements reflect the concerns, interests, contemporary trends and desires of our society.  Advertising benefits both buyers and sellers -- in a word, everyone. Advertising supports our free and independent press. Advertising brings us sports and entertainment in person, on radio and on TV. Advertising helps us make informed consumer choices and stimulates the market competition that leads to more product choices, better quality and lower prices.  But today, advertising is under attack. According to public opinion polls, much of the general public has come to regard advertising as a nuisance at best, and as a deceptive persuader at worst. Critics have accused advertising of encouraging or even causing a long list of social 11s -- from high cholesterol to alcohol abuse to urban crime. As a result of these accusations, some -- even some public officials -- have called for drastic restriction of the right to advertise.  Mike Roarty -- executive vice president for corporate marketing at Anheuser-Busch -- described the situation ina speech last year to the  American Advertising Federation. Here's a lengthy but insightful excerpt from Mike's remarks:  ae aenank  "Advertising Under Attack” Excerpts from remarks by Mike Roarty to the American Advertising Federation  ow  Advertising is under attack and our very freedom to advertise is threatened. Social critics of both the left and the right heve focused on advertising as the cause of a never-ending list of national iils.  Their all-purpose prescription for society’s problems is a simple one: Just get rid of those ads! And lest any of you become complacent, let me emphasize that we're not talking here just about beer advertising -- we're talking about Bll advertising. All advertising is under the gun, and your product or your client may well be next.  Consider a few recent news stories: ° In Finland, a court banned a McDonald's ad showing 2 youngster who is upset over moving, but who smiles when he spots a McDonald's near his  new home. The court found the ad deceptive, saying it suggests that Big Macs can replace friends.  -1-     7369 SLLOS

__label__6 eg 124  DRAFT  Confidential - Prepared for Covington and Burlin     L-Glutamine CAS RN 56-85-9 Glutamine  CAS RN 6899-4-3  Abstract:  L-Glutamine has been characterized as a nonessential or nutritionally dispensable amino acid but recent studies suggest that it may be a conditionally essential nutrient, particularly in catabolic disease states. As a flavorant, L-glutamine has essentially no taste or odor and its main contribution is probably in the production of "secondary flavorings" which make their appearance in the course of oxidative or enzymatic action. These so-called Maillard-type products are produced when glutamine reacts with reducing sugars to produce substances with both characteristic taste and flavor. L-Glutamine is listed as’ GRAS by  FEMA (#3684) and is approved for food use by FDA.  Few acute or chronic toxicity studies for L-glutamine have been  reported. For the mouse, an oral LDeg of 21.7 g/kg was reported  and for the rat, a LDe 9 7.5 g/kg orally was reported.  566614581

Project 7131 (Personnel: Bellin, Hutchens, Brooks)  Due to a mild winter and an unusually long hot summer, cigarette beetle counts for the season have been excessively high. A total of 4,475,800 beetles has been trapped to date. This is the largest number of insects trapped since the summer of 1976, a season which required a large number of fumigations following a mild winter. Forty-four shed fumigations have been completed this quarter. Twenty-two of these have been at Davie County storage. This is 85% of the Davie sheds which contain tobacco. Rapid buildup of insect populations has necessitated fumigating in two locations at the same time. This is the first time in the history of the insect control program that this has been necessary.  The insecticidal fogging schedule at Davie has been increased to six nights each week. All other locations are being fogged every other night (three times each week).  A sample of each DDVP mix has been analyzed by Mr. David Heavner. Concentrations of DDVP in the mixes ranged from 9.5%-13.3%. The correct concentration is 9.3%. The meter-which measures kerosene was found to be in error and has been replaced with a new one. Analysis of the latest mix, using the new meter has not been completed.  Counts from factory traps are up to date. The increased number of beetles in the traps from the receiving areas indicates that insects are betng brought into the factories from the high infestations in the sheds. This could lead to higher customer complaints due to insects.  Application of Kabat R +o tobacco at the Brook Cove stemmery has been completed. A total of 93.5 gallons of Kabat R was used to treat 3,318,192 pounds of stems (9.24 ppm) and 95.5 gallons used to treat 3,232,223 pounds of strips (9.69 ppm). The calculated rate of application was 10 ppm. The cost of the chemical to treat this tobacco was $22,680.  The stems are stored in cardboard boxes and the leaf in poly-wrapped Tersa bales. The tobacco is stored in Shed 435 at Brook Cove. The shed is not being fogged nor will it be fumigated. Insect counts will be monitored  “closely and temperature and humidity measurements taken weekly during the test period. The insect count in the shed to date is 4,263.  NN  ghL9 LZE0S

__label__6 ATTACHMENT IV  MARKET: Totedo MANAGER: Curtis Clingman  VAN SAMPLING PROGRAM  VAN PERSONNEL  You are to screen and hire one female distributor to work with the Van Manager. One distributor will work with the Van Manager for each day he is in the market. Your distributor will be responsible for traveling with the Van Manager to each site and giving samples to pedestrians (1 per person). The Distributor must not give samples to anyone in cars, to anyone who appears to be under the age of 21, and must always ask if the consumer is a smoker before offering a sample. The Van Manager will have with him uniforms (sizes 8 - 10) and sampling baskets.  VAN SITES  You must identify and schedule three distribution sites per day for the van. These sites should include parks, shopping malls with parking lots, picnic areas, concerts or other recreational facilities. Please be certain that the van will not need a permit to sample or play music at these sites. In essence, the Van Manager will be under your direction for the days he's in your market. The Van will proceed to each site, play music, and distribute samples. Written permission must be obtained to sample on private property such as shopping malls.  In some markets, the client's local representatives have pre-planned special events for the van to sample. In this case, there is no need for you to schedule any additional sites for the van to sample on special event day. (See attached Execution Calendar). For these events, you'll need to provide the Van Manager with 2 or 3 distributors, depending on estimated attendance at the events, which allows the van to distribute a 2 day (if using distributors) allocation. This eliminates 2 or 3 days of sampling activity. However, the van will still make site visits on the remaining days to play music.  PRODUCT & PREMIUMS  In all markets, the product for the Van Manager will be with the local client representative, The Van Manager will have all the information needed to retrieve the product on his first day in the market, and be responsible for it throughout the four days of executions. The Van Manager will distribute premiums along with cigarettes in each market, The premiums will be forwarded to you via UPS.  EL, FEO

__label__6 Environmental Tobacco Smoke in Aircraft Cabins: A Scientific Perspective  The U.S. Department of Transportation’s position on the issue of smoking 2. in aircraft cabins is based on scientific principles. In responding to recommendations offered by the National Academy of Sciences in their report on the Airliner Cabin Environment, the Department recognized that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) could be viewed as a problem by some crew , and passengers [emphasis added]. They concluded, however, “that further : study is needed before the Department can propose a definitive response to [the Academy's} recommendation". The call for further study reflects the simple fact that not enough is known about the concentrations of ETS in cabins and therefore non-smokers’ exposure to ETS. Attitudes bearing on the issue are currently more subjective than objective.  The scientific literature contains but a few reports providing information regarding measurements of ETS in cabins. All these reports share a common feature: . data indicate ETS concentrations to be very low.  In a report to be published in October, 1987 in the American Chemical Society’s periodical, Environmental Science & Technology, Oldaker and Conrad find ETS exposures in no-smoking sections to average 4 thousandths of a "cigarette equivalent"* for an approximate one-hour flight. Additionally, these researchers find that segregation effectively reduces non-smokers’  exposure to ETS. Comparable exposures were reported by Japanese researchers in . .  Historically, findings of low ETS concentrations extend back to the first such reported study which was commissioned jointly by the Departments of Health Education and Welfare and Transportation. One notable aspect of this study is that it was conducted before segregation was required. The other is that the segregation requirement ultimately derived not from the results of the measurements but from responses to questionnaires on passengers’ attitudes toward smoking.  Experiments have also been performed involving measurements of flight attendants’ bodily fluids in order to estimate exposure to ETS. These experiments can be summarized with the conclusions drawn in the New England Journal of Medicine by one research group representing the San Francisco General Hospital Medical Center:  the quantity of [nicotine, an indicator of ETS] consumed {equivalent to one cigarette} is relatively small compared with that consumed by cigarette smokers, and the concentrations achieved are unlikely to have physiologic effects.  .*The "smoke equivalent of a cigarette” is calculated from measurements of nicotine and particles, major components of environmental tobacco smoke. Calculation assumes a person breathing at a certain rate and a cigarette delivering a sales-weighted average amount of nicotine and/or tar as reported by the FTC. The cigarette equivalent is an estimate of. exposure and should not be confused with dose (that {s, how much smoke a person breathes and  9229 62905  -l-

Many of my earlier publications involved kinetic studies of various enzymes derived from normal and malignant tissue. In 1967, I (with Drs. E. Borek and P.R. Srinivasan) provided the first demonstration of mammalian DNA methylase (Biochem. 7, 280). In 1967, I joined Dr. Alex Novikoff in the Department of Pathology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine where I continued studies in nucleic acid metabolism in addition to learning electron microscopic techniques. In 1969, I joined the SUNY Health Science Center as an Assistant Professor of Pharmacology and expanded my research to include experimental cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy. In addition to my research, I have for the past 21 years been teaching cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy to medical students, house staff and practicing physicians (Continuing Education) at the Medical Center and affiliated hospitals.

__label__6 Avoust 14, 1268  MONTHLY REPORT. August 1968  Chin K. Lee  GLUCOSE ISOMERASE  I have been using the resorcinol method in determining the fructose produced by isomerase reaction. Although this method is sensitive enough to detect 0.025 uMoles of fructose, the reproducibility was unsatisfactory. Therefore, I sought a method which allows best differential measurement of fructose in the presence of large quantities of glucose with dependable reproducibility. The improved method was obtained by modifying the con- ditions employed for the resorcinol method. Briefly, the new method js as follows: 1.0 ml. of sample containing 0.1 to 5.0 yMoles of fructose, 3.0 ml. of 12.2 N HC1, and 1.0 ml. of 0.05% resorcinol in absolute ethanol are incubated at 60° C. for 5 minutes and cooled immediately at 0°. Absorb- ance measured at 410 my» shows linear relationship with the concentration of fructose. In this method, 100 pMoles of glucose give the same optical density as 0.45 uMoles of fructose (220 fold); whereas, in the old method, 35 uMoles of glucose were equivalent to 0.25 yMoles of ghicose (140 fold) in the optical density. fy tee  The effort to purify the isomerase brought some progress. The protamine sulfate treated extract was subjected to acetone fractionation and then ammonium Sulfate fractionation. The combined treatment resulted in about tenfold increase in specific activity with 90% recovery. Further purifi- cation by means of column chromatography is now under progress.  ANALYTICAL SERVICE  Five hundred eighty-two samples of maltose and 60 samples of fructose were analyzed during the period of July 13 to August 13.  Ce LL kin “Chir K.

__label__1 (BURRELLE’S NewsExpress,  Page 1 of 2 (SSFLOK16)  By GLENN SINGER BUSINESS WAITER  ROCKVILLE, Md. — Let's face it. Nisn’t easy to quit smoking.  Mast of us know people who have tried smoking cessation clas- ses, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, the drug Zyban and even hypnosis —and then went back ta their pack-a-day habit.  Now, scientists at Nabi, a Boca Raton-based biopharmaceutical company, are working on a new  approach.  and technical support from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, they are devel- oping a vac- cine to prevent nicetine from reaching the Naso brain and trig- gering chemi- cal reactions that cause addiction.  “You can try to quit smoking, but the addiction is always there. The desire to smoke hardly ever goes away,” said Robert Naso, a Nabi se- lor vice president who oversees product development at company laboratories in Maryland.  Nabi, which previously special- ized in collecting and providing plasma to other pharmaceutical manufacturers, now focuses its re- search and development efforts on creating and marketing drugs that prevent and treat infectious and au- to-immune diseases.  The company has several clini-     EDT     Sun May 28, 2000  With financial’  Appears On Page 1F Circulation: 391,063  , Vaccine  maker  targets.

Sales of phar- maceutical and antibody products generated $234 million in 1999 for  Nabi, which has 1,750 employees.  It had $3.3 million in net income last year. Its stock has been trading in the $5-6 range recently and closed on Friday at $4.88.  The idea to create an anti-smok- ing vaccine came, in part, from the development ofan unrelated vac- cine for staphylococcus infections that uses similar technology.  The key to getting someone to stop smoking is to find a way to sti- fle the desire, Nabi scientists be- lieve they can accomplish that with an injectable vaccine that not only prevents nicotine molecules from passirig from the bloodstream inta  - the brain, but also prompts the im-  Ml MEDICINE continues on 10F  mune systern to create antibodies that eliminate nicotine from the body.  “It’s a fascinating concept — novel and unique," said Frank Voc- ct, director of the division of treat- ment, research and development for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. “The methods we have used to date don’t really work that well. This could be a real advancement.”  The institute announced in April that it had awarded Nabi a four- year grant to conduct further tests on animals, particularly those re- laled to safety, and then conduct human trials. The first year’s por- fion, $776,000, will be released Sept. 30.  if human irials are successtui and the vaccine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration Nic-VAX, as itis called, could be available by 2005, Naso said, The company is seeking a partner to help pay development costs thai could run inte the tens of millions The partner also is needed to heip sell the product in the United Siates, and, possibly, around the warld.  “We think there’s a tremendous potential market for the vaccine worldwide,” Naso said. “Cleariy, this would be a high-valued prod- uct, but it’s far too early to talk about price.”  The scope of the potential niar- ket is huge.  More than 25 percent of a Americans, or about 50 milliun               people, smoke cigarettes. Add i: this an estimated 6 million teen-ap- ers and more than 100,000 childre:. under age 13, according to povern- ment figures. ,  About 80 percent of smakers ex- press a desire to quit, while 26 pur cent actually try. Fewer than 5 per- cent of those who make the attempt succeed for six months or longer. according to the American Psychi- atric Assaciation.  Nabi scientists and their collaba- rators in Minneapolis and Housten are growing excited about the po- ject, now that efficacy testing im mice, rats, rabbits and goats fas shown the vaccine blocks nicotine from entering the brain.  “We are having discussions with the Food and Drug Administrator     S LELvges0z
__label__6 ANALYST IMPRESSIONS  I listened to several impromptumedia interviews of Analysts. In general, the Analysts' answers were precise, low-key and  favorable about the development.  They also refused to speculate on questions designed to  elicit a negative and/or controversial response.  John of the Wall Street Journal asked one analyst if this product failed would it “be like the introduction of new.  Coke?" the answer was:  "Of course not; Coke withdrew a product and RJR is not doing that. Also this is nowhere near the same level of spending  and commitment.  Another analyst said it "is a good move because RJR has nothing to lose here. It's a technological advancement and that puts them on the leading edge. But, if it doesn't fly  they have really not invested that much.  ui °o a _ wn Ww w ~ oO

__label__6 March 26, 1984  COMMENTS OF THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE ON THE POLICY ANALYSIS BOOK ON "ECONOMIC COSTS" OF SMOKING  As a self-admitted antismoking document, the book is unimpressive, Apparently it is intended by its initiator and financial sponsor, Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, as a  marketing tool for its stop-smoking gum, Nicorette.  It will be interesting to see the rebuttals to its thesis by others in the antismoking movement who claim the excess cost argument has no merit because smokers’ lives are shorter  and their health care expenses are actually no greater.  We will sit out this argument, though we must wonder why the authors fail to examine the costs nonsmokers must obviously incur over their lifetimes as a basis for comparison. Obviously, not smoking does not guarantee either a disease-free life  or immortality. Nonsmokers have the same chronic illnesses which are discussed in the book, and many smokers never develop  then.  Overall, we are not impressed with the book.  tn q & te bn
__label__1 By Wilkam Safire  WASHINGTON, May 15—Carmine DeSapio, boss of Tammany Hall a gen- eration ago, abolished the smoke- filled room uring his tenure as leader because his eyes were sensitive to smoke.  Im that sense at jeast. Mr. DeSapio ds regarded as a prophet without honor in his own time by members of a mew organization. one fiercer and rrore self-righteous than the old Tiger of Tammany: the Group Against Smok- ers’ Pollution (GASP).  Across the nation, GASP chapters have been formed to help shame the 52 million American smokers into re- fraining from indulging their habit in the “breathing space” of nonsmokers.  “Nonsmokers have rights tco” is the slogan of GASP and in its “libera- tion guide” there are tips to members about methods to discomfit those whe discomfort them. Some ideas are forthright—"Speak out against smok- ing!*"—while others are maddening, such as “Discourage smoking by not providing ashtrays.”  So far, so good: In an enclosed space, people who are annoyed by tobacco smoke should make known their irritation to smokers, who should then have the courtesy to desist. Un- fortunately. that is not the last GASP: Buoyed by their success in getting air- Hines to segregate smokers, the non- smokers are pressing their attack with demands for government regulatior. of “breathing space.”  From Barry Goldwater's Arizona to George McGovern’s South Dakota. states have passed laws prohibiting smoking in museums. concert halls, theaters, libranes and elevators.

A little group of willful persons, representing no opinion but thtir own, has rendered the great smoking public helpless and contemptible.  “Where a fire or health hazard exists, nobody disputes that smoking should     de prohibited. But despite the fuming”  of former Surgeon General Jesse Steinfeld, no evidence exists to sug- gest that the exhaled smoke of other persons poses a health hazard to non- smokers. A tiny minority is acutely allergic to smoke, and its wishes need to be considered, but public policy ought not to be set to accommodate today’s Carmine DeSapios.  The cigarette smoker is already the target of too many Government agen- cies. He cannot be advertised to on television; he must carry around on every pack a dire warning about kill- ing himself; he is taxed regressively and punitively.  Yet the smoker continues to smoke; in the United States last year, 588 billion cigarettes were puffed, dragged upon and choked over, and thanks to the growing interest in smoking by teen-age girls, the market continues te grow,  This perverseness—the refusal of people to do what is gond for them — activates the antismoking brigade, | think, even more than the annovance caused by the exhalation of the coffin- nailers. If smokers do not respond to reason. to wamings, to the silencing of advertising, to tax disincentives, then perhaps the only way is to make it more difficult to find a place to Nght up.

Not every social inequity needs a legal cure: social, not government, pressure is appropriate to curb the smoker. A giare, a sniff, and if necessary the green-gilled appearance of the onset of motion sickness, should be enough to get a smoker to stub out his butt in a hurry.  T gave up smoking two years ago and it is like Josing a friend, I don’t feel any better, and am not inclined to badger others into sacrificing one of life’s little pleasures. What incenses some people is incense to me; blow some my way.  But the abuse of the power of health agencies to put a governmental fist into the glove of social courtesies is worrisome. A new law separating smoking from nonsmoking areas in restaurants would invite a smoker's Sit-in at a nonsmoking lunch counter, turning the civil-rights clock back by decades.  in their zeal, the people from GASP have gone too far. we can now look forward to the formation of “People United to Fight for Freedom by Figh:- ing Fire With Fire” (PUFFF).

DISTRIBUTION OF AVERAGE VALUES FOR NICOTINE DELIVERY PER CIGARETTE SMOKER  T. D. Darby, Ph.D. and James E. McNamee, Ph.D.  University of South Carolina School of Medicine  These evaluations of cotinine plasma values from a study of thirty-nine smokers of ultra-low nicotine and tar cigarettes conducted by Franklin Institute provide further assurance that the Barclay brand is an ultra-low delivery cigarette. Several methods have been used to date that provide for classification of different brands according to the nicotine and tar content delivered to the smoker. The FTC method is the standard procedure for establishing nicotine and tar delivery for each cigarette smoked,  The use of cotinine plasma level determinations obtained from smokers under established smoking conditions allows for comparison between predicted values for plasma cotinine and observed values. Using the kinetic equations described in Part I and the sequential solution computer model, it is possible to arrive at a predicted plasma Jevel for cotinine based upon cigarette consumption utilizing labeled value for nicotine delivery. With establishment of the mathematical relationship between observed and predicted continine values, it is possible to estimate the average delivery for each cigarette smoked. Figures 7 through 4  provide a histogram of the average delivery for the brands studies. Figures 5  265920T0S  and 6 illustrate the variation in number of cigarettes smoked per day for the     different brands studied. The diary values were used to construct these histograms.     Since smoking patterns varied within days for each smoker, it is possible that  these values may not reflect exact values for use with the computer model.     501026597 PRODUCED FROM BéW WEB SITE

Visual comparison of the resulting chromatograms showed the TM-6 sidestream to be considerably less complex than the 1R4F sidestream at every sampling point.  Quantitation of the resulting peaks (relative to the internal standard) showed that the TM-6 sidestream contains fewer components (96% less in the particulate phase and 82% less in the vapor phase) and less total material (97% less in the particulate phase and 84% less in the vapor phase) than the 1R4F sidestream.

QUESTION: Did Dr. Huber pay for the security evaluation?  ANSWER: No, QUESTION: Is R.J. Reynolds in the habit of providing free security consultation services to other people? ANSWER: Reynolds is both a national and international company. In the course of doing business it must necessarily be concerned with problems of secur’ both for facilities and for personnel. From time to time the company has shared its expertise with others outside the company. QUESTION: Could you identify the recipients of such services? ANSWER: No. QUESTION: Could you give a general identification? ANSWER: No, because even a general identification would constitute a violation  of the recipient's privacy. Obviously Reynolds would have no  8219 n9EOS¢  objection to any such recipient coming forth should they wish to

Introduction  A 14-day nose-only inhalation study was conducted at Battelle’s Pacific Northwest Laboratory under contract to the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco company. The objective of the study was to investigate the potential biological effects, if any, of 10 consecutive workday exposures of glycerol aerosol in rats. In addition, the study was conducted to provide dose selection information for a possible subchronic inhalation study of the same material.  6.4.3.4.2.2 Experimental Design  The study included four experimental groups. One group was exposed only to fresh filtered air and three groups were exposed to concentrations of glycerol aerosol of 1, 2 or 4 mg/liter; respectively. Exposures were conducted for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week for ten consecutive workdays. Each exposure group consisted of 10 male and 10 female rats which were 4 to 5 weeks old at receipt.  6.4.3.4.2.3 Experimental Animals  The Sprague-Dawley-derived rat was chosen as the test system for this study because of the historical data base available from previously conducted inhalation studies and its compatibility with other endpoints of interest to R.J. Reynolds. In addition, this strain has a lower incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia than does the other commonly utilized F-344 rat.  Test subjects were quarantined for 3 weeks and screened for clinical abnormalities prior to selection for test article exposure. Complete serology evaluations were conducted twice, at a two week interval, prior to study start.  6.4.3.4.2.4 Animal Husbandry  Rats were individually housed in hanging, stainless steel wire mesh cages which were cleaned weekly. Animal care was in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act of 1970 and amendments (Public Law 91-579) "Specifications for the Humane handling, Care, Treatment and Transportation of Warm-blooded Animals other than Dogs, Cats, Rabbits, Hamsters, Guinea Pigs and Nonhuman Primates." Room conditions included 12 hours of dark, 12 hours  2029 2190S

Hewitt, co-directors of UC!’s Reconstructive Microsurgery and Transplantation Laboratory. The research team also included Dr. David Furnas, chief of plastic sur-~, gery, and Dr. Bruce Achauer, a plastic surgeon and director of the burn unit at UCI Medical Center.                        Findings of the study, funded by ~~ the National Institutes of Health, were published recently in the journal, Transplantation.  Black, a bio-engineer, said the” findings are encouraging.  “This research could spark a revol- ution in transplant surgery,” he said. “For the first time, we have shown that tissues of this kind can be transplanted for long terms of survival in animals,” oo.  But he added, “The bottom line is that there’s still a lot of work to do before we can apply this clinically in people.” :  He said the transplant research at UCI has taken place over the past six years.  “Most of the success has been attributed to cyclosporine, _ Blac! said, referring to as anti-rejection drug discovered in the mid-1970s.     Cyclosporine allows the body to protect itself against infection, but suppresses rt of the immune system invoived in the rejection of transplanted tissue. In humans, the drug has been used to help prevent rejection in kidney, bone marrow, heart-lung, pancreas and liver trans-  plants.  Black said the UCI experiments determined that the drug could also help in composite tissue transplants. The tests also focused on how much cyclosporine was needed and what  side effects the-drug -migh' Finally, the researchers found that the transplanted tissues could survive for the duration of the animal’s life.  The transplanted rat legs showed signs of near-normal .muscle and nerve activity. But the limbs did not function completely — the rats could not walk normally on the tranplanted. legs —- because of the complexity of reconnecting the nerves and muscles required for such movement.  The rats used in the UCI tests normally have a three-year life span. Black said some of the rats that underwent leg transplants lived as long as 700 days after the surgery.  He said researchers were able to  accomplish the transplants with rela- tively low dosages of cyclosporine, an important finding because the drug can be toxic at high levels, The finding that the transplant limbs survived after discontinuing cyclosporine was unexpected, and the UCI scientist said additional studies are planned. While functional human limb transplants are years away, Black said the UCI experiments may have more immediate implications in the re- placement of large areas of skin, muscle, blood vessels and bone damages by burns, gunshot wounds or other injuries. He said such tissue grafts could eventually replace the prosthetic devices used today.  50288669  shaven... -.

Our studies show that smokers smoke the NC differently than the RC, since they take more puffs closer together in time. The cigarettes are different from one another in many respects, however, other than nicotine yields. There is no evidence for compensation, as judged by the amount of nicotine absorbed relative to the yield of  nicotine.  22. Did you at any time notice smokers compensating their smoking patterns when smoking the NC?  How one responds to a question on compensation depends on its definition. If one defines "compensation" as the smokers attempt to achieve a particular plasma nicotine level concordant with his/her accustomed plasma nicotine level when smoking his/her regular brand, when compared to PREMIER, then we can say there is no compensation. The smoker’s level of plasma nicotine level when smoking PREMIER never approaches those plasma nicotine levels observed when  smoking the reference cigarettes.

__label__1 ao f dean Honea os inn ‘4g ae dl     ~  DOES LUNG cancer actually occur more often in smokers, or does it only seem to do so because it is hunted with greater diagnostic vigour in such  persons?  Recent work by an inter. nationally known epidemiolo- nist suggests that “ detection  , bias" in a variety of studies | may just possibly have pro-  duc: a “falsely high  ‘ass... ution” between smok-  ing and lung cancer. Dr Alvin R. Feinstein, Pro-  fessor of Medicine and Epi-  cemiology at Yale University, suys that if his findings of such “bias" in a study of more than 1,300 lung cancer patients are confirmed for the seneral population of smok- ers and nonsmokers, “we may have to reappraise some of the statistical reascning  “that has hitherto been used  to form causal conclusi«ns " about smoking as a carcino cen,  The findings were based on a fetrospective restudy of data on all patients (1,331) with a diagnosis of primary ‘uag cancer at Yale-New Haven Hospital and West tlaven Veterans Administra- re Hospital during 1953-  The first clue to the exist- cnce of a possihly unrecog- nsed bias came with a “ necropsy surprise". Of 654 rattents examined post mor- tim lung cancer had been uns cted beforehand in 12, ue 16 per cent. , Further study showed that  nondiagnosis during life” was highest among those matlents (37 per cent) whose  Medical News Reporter  istory of cigarette smoking was unknown.  “The rate of nordiagnosis,” Dr. Feinstein said, “had a dis- tinctive downward gradient, going from 37 per cent unde- tected among the non-cigar- ette smokers to 20 per cent among the light smokers; 14  rcentin the moderate; and 0 and 12 per cent in the heavy and extreme smckers.  “There was a similar gra- dient, but with Jarcer denomi- hators, for the rate of non- diagnosis in the entire case sores, rather than in the nec- ropsy group alonc.  “The cata therefore sug- gested that the more paticnis snwked, the more likely they were to have lung cancer de- tected during life.”  He and his colleague, Dr.’  Carolyn K. Wells, then exam- ined the frequency and type of diagnostic examinations ordered for the entire case series,  Chest x-rays were excluded since every patient had had one. Bronchoscopy was also exchided since it was often reserved for patients likely to have operable lesions,  _ As an index test, the inves- tigators chose the Papanico- laou sputum smear, since it is not based on operability, ere- ates no discomfort, and can     be readily ordered.  Seventy-six per cent of the total series of patients had re- ceived a Pap sputum smear, but here, too, there was a steep gradient, with the smear ordered for “53 per cent in the unknown smoking group; 58 per cent in the non- smokers; 63 per cent in the light; 78 per cent in the heavy; and 84 per cent in the extreme group.” :  The team also found thet the “ Pap smcar search rate was substantially higher for patients with a chronic or re- cent cough (83 and 6&1 per cent, respectively) than for patients with no cough (59 per cent). But within each category of cough the “search rates went up in relation to the amount of smoking.”  Among patients with no cough the search rate rose from 46 per cent in the no- smoking troup to 59 per cent among light or moderate smo- kers and to 64 per cent in the  heavy or extreme smoking group.  Among patients with chro- nic cough there was an “analgous gradient,” Dr. Fein- stein reports, ranging from 53 to 81 to 85 per cent. In patients with a recent cough, the search rate went from 64 to 80 to 84 per cent in the respective groups.  The Pap smear search rate, he added, was lower in pa- tients with disseminated can- cer than in those with distant metastases, “but in both Clinical stayes, the gradient of search increased with higher amounts of smoking.”  In a Metical News inter- view, Dr. Feinstein acknow- ledged that he was question- ing “one of the icons” of modern statistics; but he Stressed that the operative word was “ * questioning,’ not *atlacking’."" “The data we have are suitable for rsising questions, not for launching an attack,” he said.

__label__6 SMOKING MACHINE CONTROL PROGRAM NOTES  The current version of the 7317 exposure contro! program was written to contro! two Geneva smoking machines which have been modified to allow the computer to disable thelr cigarette loader and unloader functions. The program controls by momentarily enabling one of the load/unioad functions when that function Is required and must “remember” the age and location of each cigarette throughout the exposure to ensure that spent cigarettes are replaced at the proper time. The product smoking machine has two igniters that are controlled by the computer In addition to the loader and unloader, the reference smoking machine has none. The computer also times the duration of each exposure, automatically records CO monitor readings, and controls filter and Impactor samples. A realtime aerosol monitor was recently added to the exposure system and a subroutine may be written to record these readings also.  The control program has been written as a series of subroutines that fall into one of the following three categories - EXPOSURE CONTROL, FUNCTION CONTROL, or SUPPORT. Following Is a brief description of the subroutines.  EXPOSURE CONTROL SUBROUTINES:  SUBROUTINE PARM | Loads required parameters fromthe data tables Into memory. | |  SUBROUTINE LABL Allows the operator to enter Information Into the program before the Inklation of an exposure. The  information may inchide which machine will be loaded with product and which with reference, the exposure concentration, or #f ether machine will not be used during an exposure cycle. The computer will record this Information In the exposure summation or will “ignore* a machine that was not used for exposure.  SUBROUTINE LODE  Loads the carousel following a prescribed pattern and maintains the carousel by replacing cigarettes after they have puffed the required number of times. The computer leaves LODE when a “start exposure" signal Is recelved and transfers control to subroutine EXPS, LODE functions through the following “Function Control Subroutines"  * EJCA which controls machine #1 elector  * IJCA which controls machine #1 Injector  ¢ TCHA which controls machine #1 torch #1 and li’s associated auxilliary puff port * TCHB which controls machine #1 torch #2  + EJCB which controls machine #2 ejector  « [JCB which contro! machine #2 injector  SUBROUTINE EXPS : Continues to maintain the carousels by using the same subroutines used by LODE but also turns smoke to the animals, takes measurements, and controls various samplers that are required during an exposure. At the end of the prescribed exposure period exposure stops and the carousel unloads. Contro! then transfers to subroutine SUMA. EXPS uses the following contro! subjoutines In addition to those listed under LODE: | * SPLR which controls the samplers « COMO which records CO monitor readings * ARAM will record aerosol monitor readings if we decide to add tt. |  |  |  i I!  SUBROUTINE SUMA / | Sums information and data from each exposure and prints a summation table. The program then resets itself and walts for the next exposure cycle to bagin. |  |  2280 Seen

__label__6 ‘ We sermemarte oe  TITLE OF RESEARCH PROJECT: THE COMBINED ROLE OF TOBACCO SMOKE CONDENSATES, AVITAMINOSIS AND ALCOHOL IN THE ETIOLOGY OF ORAL CANCER INTRODUCTION :  During the past twelve years IT, as well as many of my colleagues, have observed that a large percentage of patients afflicted with oral cancer illicited histories of excessive tobacco smoking, concomitant abuse of alcoholic beverages and diets deficient in essential protein and vitamins. It is theoretically possible that the dietary deficiency cowld condition the oral tissues or be a predisposing factor en- abling the carcinogen present in the tobacco condensate to induce the development of a cancerous process. The role of alcohol may be that of a synergistic direct irritant, or indirectly by its action on the liver to effect degenerative changes leading to cirrhosis; thus impairing an important immune center of the body.  Experimently, it is the purpose of this project to induce in laboratory animals (white mice) cancer of the oral tissues by combining the factors, tobacco condensates, alcohol, and dietary deficiencies.  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 8  Six groups of white mice, each group to consist of ten mice will be subjected to variations of tobacco application, alcohol and diet. A control group will be in- cluded. The tobacco condensate will be diluted in 50% acetone and will be painted on the oral mucosa four times weekly. The alcohol will be placed in the drinking water of the animals and changed completely four times weekly. A 10% solution of a standard brand of whiskey will be used. The diets, when deficient, will be re~ stricted in Vit. "A", "B" complex and "OC".  ANTMAL GROUPS: Group I The oral mucosa will be painted on the same gite with the tobacco condensate. Aleohol will be added to the water. The diet will be deficient in Vitamins  HA, Ep and ncn,

After waiting for 90 minutes for the aldermen, several tobacco executives and lobbyists, who had flown in from Washington, D.C. and Springfield, left the meeting room but vowed to attend her June 14, 10 a.m. Health Committee meeting where pro-smoking forces will verbally sword fight over community complaints that Black neighborhoods have allegedly been flooded with billboard ads depicting smoking as "OK," seductive, cool, according to Butler.  Should the aldermen muster up the needed 26 City Council votes for passage, the controversial bill would ban outdoor cigarette ad signs and rolling papers which is often used for smoking marijuana.  But such heavyhitters as Jack Kraft, chief financial officer of Leo Burnett Company, Stephen R. Shinn, from Gannett Outdoor of Chicago, and Ellen Venable, executive director of the Chicago Advertising Club, who were poised to testify last week, told the  der they are more concerned about censorship by the singling out of outdoor cigarette ads which is how they make their living and that of their clients.  Promising an all-out war against this alleged censorship, Kraft asked, “Have you ever heard of a little bit of censorship?" He and the others feel that the First Amendment would be violated should this bill pass.  While sensitive to the issues of youth smoking and the possible rippling effect that sometimes leads to drug use, Kraft said the singling out of cigarettes is "wrong" and perhaps unconstitutional. "What do we do next target sugar for banning?"  Shinn said zeroing in on cigarette advertisement is "unwarranted" with Venable arguing that the problem is not with billboard ads but rather the lack of enforcement of minors being allowed to purchase cigarettes.  Shinn said the tobacco industry spends about $600 million a year  for advertisement mostly in newspapers and magazines and only two percent on billboards.  TYILBC 011042

This does not mean that we  should scrap existing material or go into overtime in order  to accomplish this objective. However, any new units oF currently being prepared for use in newspaper should include  the Warning Statement.  fhe timing for the appearance of the Warning Statement in magazines and out-of-home media is shown on the attached sheet. . The scheduling was agreed to by the Brands as the earliest practical date for use of the Warning Statement in these media.  These timing instructions do not supersede the instructions you have received earlier giving you the final date of compliance, but they are intended to coordinate all brands' scheduling so that the Warning Statement will begin to appear about the same time in all our brand advertising.  Please advise if you have questions regarding this timing. CHECKING PROCEDURE  s_and the Agencies have the primary responsibility bf insucing that each unit of advertising has the necessar y Warning Statement—and-the-ftand_N Legend. The Agencies have been provided with the necessary information for compliance and are taking steps internally to insure that all material will have the necessary  Warning and T and N Legend. It will be necessary, however, for the Brands to continue to oversee the Agency on these matters.  _ a D  ooze €£70S

__label__6 ra  RJR MEDIA Position Paper No. 8 Subject: Translating National Media  Programs of Cigarette Products Into Test Market Situations. .  ‘  Background - The Corporation is presently committed to test marketing several new cigarette brands. Given the uniqueness of each brand's marketing strategy, it would not be feasible to formulate a media translation procedure encompassing all possible test situations. However, a general course of action is evident which may be applied to most test market translations.  In scope, the following will set down a general media policy for test market concepts, market selection, and the mechanics of media:  Discussion ~ Test Market Concepts  - There are two test market concepts which MRD may use in reading the |  S  results of a market test--"National Simulation" or "Division Simulation." The following is a discussion of these two concepts and the implications which they have for developing a media translation:  National Simulation ("Little U.S." Translation) - In this situation, each test division serves as a model for the total U.S. marketing  area, Ideally, there are three test divisions, each with a population of 500M+. In addition, the configuration of each division in  ta  of metro, rural, and ethnic population, sales distribution, and media penetration should closely resemble that of the national market as  a whole. Obviously, it is doubtful that any test*division will exactly conform to both the U.S. population profile and the coverage provided by a national media plan; usually, the selected division represents the best compromise under the circumstances.  In addition to MRD's criteria for selecting a division for test (BDI, category development, etc.), these media and demographic factors should ‘be considered:  1) Metro population: % division vs. % total U.S. 2) Rural population (C & D counties): % division vs. % total U.S.  3) Ethnic population (Black and/or Spanish): 8% division vs. % total U.S.  4) National magazine penetration in the division vs. total \ U.S. average. NOTE: The county-by-county circulation of the magazines should be determined to acknowledge geographic circulation variances.  L809 0200S

__label__1 Letters to the Editor  On Ulcer Therapy Sir: I read the article on ‘“Contro- versies-in Ulcer Therapy” (MWN, June 23) with interest. Some years ago, I discarded the’ theory of hyperacidity as a total ‘ cause for the presence of the benign duodenal or gastric ulcer, and decided that the Sippy diet was inadequate. Benign duodenal or gastric ulcer is     a multifaceted disorder involving not only hyperacidity but hypermotility, infection, allergy, and local endarte- ritis obliterans. Although I am a sur- geon, I recognize that adequate medi- eal therapy for the benign ulcer must include eradication of any or all of the above factors in order to satisfac- torily rectify the disease.  ‘The Sippy diet was discarded by me because it not only did not clear all the symptoms but left the patient weak and unhappy. With the treat- ment that I followed [which begins with placing the patient on a milk-, wheat-, and egg-free diet] not only was relief frequently obtained, but there was an absence of the monot- ony of a milk and cream diet. Often  dramatic symptoms of well-being ©  were encountered, particularly if [an allergy to} milk was [causing the disorder]... .  MILTON W. WHITE, M.D. Detroit  Sir: I have just read with interest the article “Controversies in Ulcer Ther-  F1EqICSi VVC CWE em  apy.” There are many ideas put forth about medication, diet, and rest, but I was greatly disappointed that no one mentioned anything about the effect of cigarette smoking on peptic ulcers.  I have been in general practice for 41 years in the western part of Cin- cinnati, and although I have not kept the kind of statistics that research people do, I have come to some very firm conclusions about the relation- ship of smoking to ulcers.  In fact, I have had many patients come to me with recurrent ulcers— having been treated by other doctors without success—who healed their ul- cers within a few weeks when the abolition of smoking was added to their daily routines. I have also had many other patients who did not stop smoking and who had recurrences, al- though they stayed on a diet and [took] antacids.  As a result of this experience, for the past 20 years I have refused to treat all ulcer patients unless they  ‘ would promise to stop smoking per-  manently. FOSTER M. WILLIAMS, M.D. Cincinnati  Sir: “Controversies in Uleer Therapy” interested me very much in that at this late hour in medical history con- troversy should exist on the subject.  Certainly there is a consensus that if you can maintain neutralization of the gastric acidity and establish con- comitant normal digestion through- out the gut, you are going to heal the ulcer—providing the area has not been so cicatrized [that] normal arte- rial, venous, and lymphatic movement to [it has been completely cut off].  When this has occurred, a gastro- plasty or duodenoplasty would appear to be entirely proper.  But a vagotomy at qny time sug- gests .. . surgical-medical incompe- tence in the fields of diet, psychothe- rapy, and physiology.  ERNEST J. CARLSON, D.O. Denver  Sudden Loss of Hair Pigment  Sir: The article “White from Fright— or Lack of Henna?” (mwN, June 23)  RTS tied  Pi) "© HKa0074158  brings to mind my critical evaluation of the subject 40 years ago in Hand- book der Haut und Geschlechtsk- rankheiten, (Vol. 4, Part II, 1011- 1221), edited by J. Jadassohn and published by Julius Springer Verlag in 1988. The article I wrote for that collection was titled ‘Pathological Pigmentation of the Skin (and Hair) in Internal Medicine, Neurology, and  Psychiatry.”  Gradual graying of the hair is fe netically determined. But there’ is abundant evidence that canitieg, or premature depigmentation of /air, can result from continued severe stress. However, as [your article re-- porting the views of] Dr. Joseph E. Jelinek. correctly states, sudden whi-  tening of hair—e.g., overnight or in a |  day—is still disputed as it was 40 years ago, largely because it is Very        complete, one partial, of relatively rapid development in young soldiers in World War I. To be exact, eannot be accepted as cases nities subita sive acutissima because the individuals were not seen imme- diately before and after the occur- rence. This requirement is seldom ful- filled.  The effect of disorders of the ner- vous system (especially the sympa~ thetic), as well as metabolic and endo- crine disturbances, on skin and hair are well established but rarely come to the attention of the dermatologist. Aside from their diagnostic signifi- eance and scientific interest, abnor- malities of the pigment do not cause any therapeutic stir.  _ It may be for this reason that the questions of the formation of air or gas bubbles [in the hair shaft, produc- ing a white appearance] has not been settled, which one would expect, con- sidering the advanced technology of electron microscopy. I have seen un- der the microscope (at a magnifica- tion of x 1600) the disintegration of the medullary area of the shaft of a diseased whitened hair, while the cor- tex was relatively intact. .

The philosophy and goals of the meeting are unique. “In addition to bringing — together clinicians. and. basic scientists with interests. in disorders of the splanchnic organs, the meeting will bring traditional. investigators ofthe  ' splanchnic circulation together with investigators using more cellular or  molecular techniques. Thus, we hope to identify potential new research areas and to stimulate interdisciplinary research efforts. As the Conference Chairman, 1 would like to invite approximately 50 eminent investigators to speak at the meeting, and I want to encourage a number of promising young investigators to attend, by. paying their expenses. Although both the American Gastroenterological Society and FASEB have endorsed the conference. and have provided generous financial support, I still need about $15,000 to ensure that the meeting is a scientific success. The funds will be used exclusively for support of eminent clinical and basic science investigators’ meeting costs. ($400) and travel expenses (between $400 and-$1000 for ‘domestic and foreign participants).  Any amount of funding your. organization can contribute will be a great help.

__label__1 HUDSON, MASS. SUN — D. 8,720: — BOSTON METROPOLITAN AREA  1968  JUL §  Bob Pryor     All Lip Service .. Little Action  Several years ago the U. S, Surgeon General made an announcement about the hazards of cigarette smok: ing and the connection with cancer. The Medicatf™®Po- fession has linked smoking with cancer and poor health, and a small TV advertising campaign has been sug- gesting that cigarettes are a healilt hazard.  Congress passed weak legislation requiring the fo!- lowing words be printed on everv cigarette pack: “Cau. ticn: Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous To Your Health.”  Now the Public Health Service has released: an- other report on smoking. The release says ihat a heavy cigarette smoker may be shortening his life by eight years if he continues the habit. In addition to calling the cigarette habit the main cause for lung cancer, the report said the habit can: contribute to the develop- ment of fatal heart disease.  This is the first time that the PHS has linked heart coronaries to cigarette smoking in an official report. Secretary Wilbur Cohen. of the Health. Welfare, and Education Department suggested to Congress the words on cigarette packages should be changed to: “Warning:  igarette smoking is dangerous to health and may cause death from cancer and other causes.”  The FTC went a step further and suggested that cigarette advertising should be prohibited on television.  Tt.is obvious the big money interests of the Cigar- ette Industry will prevent any substantial action by the Congress. The politicians will use the same excuse that was used here in Massachusetts recently in regard to billboard advertising.  A bill to curb billboard. advertising by giving the towns and cities véf@ power was killed’ because state representatives argued it would put a lot of people out of work. This same weak excuse will undoubtedly: he used in Congress in regard to cigarettes .. . despite the far more important consideration of the health and. wel- fare of the people.  The human being is weak. and the only Wav cigar- ette smokers are going to quit the habit. is through:  . _ Some kind of prohibition. All the verbal and written:  warnings in the world will not curb smoking. Those with the habit know it’s unhealthy but haven't the will to stop. I'am no exception.  The Medical Profession tells people they should not smoke, and many: doctors tell their vatients thev should quit smoking. But the hollow words fall'on deat ears because the medical authorities do not practice vhat they preach and are really. doing little to help people quit the habit.  If cigarettes are really a health hazard, it is time that health and medical leaders stonned the “lip serv- ice” and do something about it, Action speaks louder than words.  You can still buy cigarettes in hospitals, You can still buy cigarettes in drug stores.  And in. most medical centers and doctor's offices,  ‘ you can still smoke in the waiting rooms. And; many.  doctors who speak against cigarettes are smokers them- selves.  You can’t buy poisonous drugs in drug stores with- out a prescription, and you certainly can't get them in a hosvital. All materials that may be injurious to:one’s health in a hospital are locked up .. . alll except cigar- et.es!  Perhaps it’s time. for the Surgeon General. Public Health Service. Federal Trade Commission, and atl medical authorities to fish or cuti bait. Fi:Her take. real action or stop pussy-footing around with a meuth full of words without teeth,  CEVEO09TOe

__label__1 TOBACCO June 17, 1960  Tobacco Man’‘s “Bible” .. .  HTBOO026*  Heimann’s New Book Traces History of Tobacco in U.S.  By Gerard Tetloy “Tobaccos" Editor in Danville, Va.  One of the most comprehensive works on the history of tobacco has just come off the press of the McGraw- Hill Publishing Company, New York,— a book which gives promise of being the tobacco man’s “Bible.”  Entitled “Tobacco and Americans,” it is the work of Robert K. Heimann, a tobacco expert in the field of research and it contains 260 pages and 300 extraordinarily good illustrations. It sells for $7.50.  The libreries are not without books about tobacco, but this one is so sweeping in its treatment that it will occupy a place in many a home of tobacco men. It begins with the dis- covery by the Spanish freebcoters and  lorers finding in South America inulians smoking, ‘tobago’. It then pro- ceeds fo trace the growth of the smok- ing habit and the development of America’s Brst export business. Sir Walter Raleigh and John Randolph both grew aud shipped tobacco to England where it was used as a barter medium for things needed by the Virginia colony.  Many anecdotes are contained in this well written book and the chronol- ogy of progress. It is a valuable history of the social and the economic gro of this nation. There are graphs and charts showing the rise of smoking and the whole history of man’s great solace rauges from the primitive usé of smoke to the filter tipped cigarette.  The illustrations,—-many of them made available by the Arents Collec- tion in the Public Library of New  York, give added zest to the book, especially the old advertisements of plug tobacco and cigarettes.  e rise of the Hue-cured system and the accidental discovery that char- coal cured tobacco a bright yellow by a sleepy slave in Caswell county, N.C. is developed. and the story also of Union troops, who, foraging through the Carolinas found granulated tobacco at Durham, N.C., which was popular- ized by the troops and which Vaid the foundation of a tobacco empire.  This is no buok to Le digested at one reading.

__label__1 Letters to the Editor  On Ulcer Therapy Sir: I read the article on ‘“Contro- versies-in Ulcer Therapy” (MWN, June 23) with interest. Some years ago, I discarded the’ theory of hyperacidity as a total ‘ cause for the presence of the benign duodenal or gastric ulcer, and decided that the Sippy diet was inadequate. Benign duodenal or gastric ulcer is     a multifaceted disorder involving not only hyperacidity but hypermotility, infection, allergy, and local endarte- ritis obliterans. Although I am a sur- geon, I recognize that adequate medi- eal therapy for the benign ulcer must include eradication of any or all of the above factors in order to satisfac- torily rectify the disease.  ‘The Sippy diet was discarded by me because it not only did not clear all the symptoms but left the patient weak and unhappy. With the treat- ment that I followed [which begins with placing the patient on a milk-, wheat-, and egg-free diet] not only was relief frequently obtained, but there was an absence of the monot- ony of a milk and cream diet. Often  dramatic symptoms of well-being ©  were encountered, particularly if [an allergy to} milk was [causing the disorder]... .  MILTON W. WHITE, M.D. Detroit  Sir: I have just read with interest the article “Controversies in Ulcer Ther-  F1EqICSi VVC CWE em  apy.” There are many ideas put forth about medication, diet, and rest, but I was greatly disappointed that no one mentioned anything about the effect of cigarette smoking on peptic ulcers.  I have been in general practice for 41 years in the western part of Cin- cinnati, and although I have not kept the kind of statistics that research people do, I have come to some very firm conclusions about the relation- ship of smoking to ulcers.  In fact, I have had many patients come to me with recurrent ulcers— having been treated by other doctors without success—who healed their ul- cers within a few weeks when the abolition of smoking was added to their daily routines. I have also had many other patients who did not stop smoking and who had recurrences, al- though they stayed on a diet and [took] antacids.  As a result of this experience, for the past 20 years I have refused to treat all ulcer patients unless they  ‘ would promise to stop smoking per-  manently. FOSTER M. WILLIAMS, M.D. Cincinnati  Sir: “Controversies in Uleer Therapy” interested me very much in that at this late hour in medical history con- troversy should exist on the subject.  Certainly there is a consensus that if you can maintain neutralization of the gastric acidity and establish con- comitant normal digestion through- out the gut, you are going to heal the ulcer—providing the area has not been so cicatrized [that] normal arte- rial, venous, and lymphatic movement to [it has been completely cut off].  When this has occurred, a gastro- plasty or duodenoplasty would appear to be entirely proper.  But a vagotomy at qny time sug- gests .. . surgical-medical incompe- tence in the fields of diet, psychothe- rapy, and physiology.  ERNEST J. CARLSON, D.O. Denver  Sudden Loss of Hair Pigment  Sir: The article “White from Fright— or Lack of Henna?” (mwN, June 23)  RTS tied  Pi) "© HKa0074158  brings to mind my critical evaluation of the subject 40 years ago in Hand- book der Haut und Geschlechtsk- rankheiten, (Vol. 4, Part II, 1011- 1221), edited by J. Jadassohn and published by Julius Springer Verlag in 1988. The article I wrote for that collection was titled ‘Pathological Pigmentation of the Skin (and Hair) in Internal Medicine, Neurology, and  Psychiatry.”  Gradual graying of the hair is fe netically determined. But there’ is abundant evidence that canitieg, or premature depigmentation of /air, can result from continued severe stress. However, as [your article re-- porting the views of] Dr. Joseph E. Jelinek. correctly states, sudden whi-  tening of hair—e.g., overnight or in a |  day—is still disputed as it was 40 years ago, largely because it is Very        complete, one partial, of relatively rapid development in young soldiers in World War I. To be exact, eannot be accepted as cases nities subita sive acutissima because the individuals were not seen imme- diately before and after the occur- rence. This requirement is seldom ful- filled.  The effect of disorders of the ner- vous system (especially the sympa~ thetic), as well as metabolic and endo- crine disturbances, on skin and hair are well established but rarely come to the attention of the dermatologist. Aside from their diagnostic signifi- eance and scientific interest, abnor- malities of the pigment do not cause any therapeutic stir.  _ It may be for this reason that the questions of the formation of air or gas bubbles [in the hair shaft, produc- ing a white appearance] has not been settled, which one would expect, con- sidering the advanced technology of electron microscopy. I have seen un- der the microscope (at a magnifica- tion of x 1600) the disintegration of the medullary area of the shaft of a diseased whitened hair, while the cor- tex was relatively intact. .

FASY  Department of Patholugs Mount Sinai School of Medicine New York, New Yark [0029           been ado  of that lime the prevailing view has been thal asbestos fibers do not have a clear genotoxic potential. Since this view is currently undergoing a remarkable revi- sion, this is # lmely occasion to review the matter.  Many studies of carcinogenesis point to the important role of DNA damage and the subsequent processing of the resulting DNA lesions to yield mutations. '“* Indeed, many carcinogens have been identified as mutagens (and vice versa) and mutagenesis assays have been widely adopted as surrogates for use in screening compounds for carcinogenic activity," Nonetheless, there is a growing recogni- tion that the process of carcinogenesis involves more than a series of mutations accumulating in critical genes and that nongenotoxic mechanisms also play an important though poorly understood role in expanding the size of initiated clones and by enhancing the effectiveness of genotoxic carcinogens in other ways.  The situation with asbestos fibers is far from clear. Although there is general agreement about the ability of asbestos fibers to induce aneuploidy “and to cause chromosome breaks and other chromosomal aberrations,''- there is dis- agreement between authors who report that asbestos fibers can increase the fre- quency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), which are considered as a manifes- tation of DNA damage.’*!¥ and uhose who report that ashestos fibers are not able to increase the level af SCEs in treated cells in culture,!!??? Finally, numerous investigators have examined the ability of asbestos fibers to damage DNA or to induce mutations in mammalian cell specific-locus assays, and they report that asbestos fibers have little? or no ability! 3"*-* to cause mutations tn these tests. ‘Taken together, these results have led many to the conciusion thal asbestos fibers are most unorthodox and paradoxical carcinogens and that they may act through mechanisms different from those employed by more familiar carcinogens, such as electrophilic chemicals, ionizing radiation, and ultraviolet Hehe  A large part of the controversy surrounding the genotoxicity and the muta- genicity of asbestos is semantic in nature. A mulation is commonly defined as a heritable chanye in the genome .** Therefore, the loss or gain of an entire chromo- some is quite properly regarded as a mutalion, Indeed, since monosomies oF trisomies represent the loss or gain of thousands of genes, they must be consid- ered as enormous mutations. In this regard, it is useful to recall that some of the mutants studied by DeVries (who introduced the term and the concept of muta-  271                                       50523644

Berson RE: TRUE FOCUS GROUPS - FINAL REPORT - MRD #5542/884  BACKGROUND. AND PURPOSE  A new True ldw tar line extension is scheduled for Test Market during May, 1985. Part of the research Program for this new product consisted of a qualitative exploration of several . proposed advertising concepts.  The primary purpose of the qualitative sessions was to obtain input. on the strengths and weaknesses of each concept and Getermine which if any, offered potential. It was also important to understand consumers’ reactions to a new True product in light of current attitudes toward the brand.     METHOD  . A total of eight’ focus group sessions were conducted in two  markets -~- Manhassett, Long Island and Atlanta, Georgia. All groups were composed of competitive smokers (10+ cigarettes per day) between the ages 25 and 44. The structure of the greups was consistent across both markets -~- half male, half female; haif lo-tar, half lo-fi (low tar prone). "Low tar prone" was defined as having "top 3 box" purchase intent to try a low tar brand in the future.  CONCLUSIONS  Overall, the True Gold concept met with favorable reaction. The interest for this idea was fairly equal across the major lo-fi and low tar segments although females were certainly more positive about it than males. (While more males were positive than negative, favorability among this group occurred at a lower frequency when compared to females). Males tended to see the concept as more femiriine whereas females were more likely’to view it'as neutrals ~~ - os me  packaging, tar level and filter, True Gold was seen as having little in common with the currently marketed True product.

He reported on data from the LRC study covering men and women aged 20-69 years from 10 sep- ar-te North American populations. The study group had two sequen” tial examinations: at the first, plasma cholesterol and trigly- cerides were measured; a 15% random sample of participants was re~ called for a second, more extensive examination that included a  -. detailed medical and family history- Criqui's report was based on an anlysis done on 2663 men and 2553 women. Lo  He reported confirmation of the finding that cigarette smok- ing was associated with a decrease in HDL-C. For the first time, however, the LRC data showed this association was independent of such factors as age, hormone use by women, obesity, alcohol in- take, and regular exercisc, Criqui said.  He said the evidence supports a causal relationship because? The decrease in HDL-C associated with smoking 20 or more cigarettos daily was substantial (11-14%)/ A dose-response relationship was evident in that subjects smoting 41-19 cigarettes daily had HDL-C levels intermediate between nonsmokers and heavier smokers. The HDL-C level of exsmokers in this and other studies resembled those of never smokers, arguing against the constitutional hypothesis.  we le  ~ Criqui said he (the LRC?) planned to study smoking and txi- giyceride levels.

Box J5090+ Louisville, Kentucky M282  June 30, 1978  Mr. Wyatt Williams PKG  Dear Wyatt:  Ted, Gary, and I spent the day in Little Rock yesterday riding the Rich Lights’ showing and we were pleased to find that, with one exception, all the postings were in very food condition.  The one exception was a 30-Sheet board posted at 7th and Park which was flagging and was also obscured by atree. Due to the limited visibility, we recommend that that posting be moved to a different location as opposed to simply correcting the flagging problem.  There were also two locations that we could not find. One is indicated on the map as a new location at U.S. 67 and 167 near the Little Rock Air Force Base, and the other was indicated on the map at the Junction of U.S. 70 and 130. The only 30-sheet locations near the latter point were Bordon and Camel Lights. Could you please advise the status of these two locations.  Finally, we saw a VICEROY parent 30-sheet location located  inbound on Highway 167 one mile west of the Rixie exit which was virtually falling apart (the physical structure and the paper). The structure had Baird on it, not Donrey. The location is very good; however, we should not be paying for it due to its condition. We  would like to have the board completely stripped since its advertising value is worthless and, in its present condition, is probably detrimental. Could you please check this out for us.  _ Wyatt, our net impression is that, given that the Little Rock plant a "is pretty average, to start with, Rich Lights now looks better, as _ "far as posting conditions go, than any other showing: in the market.

__label__2 Molecular mechanism of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptors involvement in autoimmunity.  Project Description  We propose to study the regulatory role of TNF and its two receptors, TNFR-1 and TNFR-2, and the mechanism of the involvement of this cytokine in the pathogenesis and genetic predisposition to autoimmune disease.  Systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), a prototypical human autoimmune disease, is a disorder of generalized autoimmunity characterized by multi-system organ involvement and autoantibodies against nuclear, cytoplasmic and cell surface antigens. The mechanism(s) responsible for the breakdown of tolerance for these self antigens are unknown. In scarch for mechanisms responsible for immune dysregulation in SLE, cytokines have received increasing attention. One particular cytokine, TNF-o has an important protective role under the appropriate conditions in a mouse model of SLE, the (NZBxNZW)F1 mice.  The TNF genes, which include the TNFa, LTa, and the recently cloned LTB genes, are unique among all known cytokines and growth factors in that they are the only cytokine genes located within the central portion of the Major Histocompatability Complex (MHC). Because of TNF's location, and because many of its potential biological activities are related to immunoregulation and inflammation, the possibility that an "abnormal" TNF gene could be involved in autoimmune diseascs was tested experimentally. | have shown that activated peritoneal macrophages from NZW mice produce 5- to 10-fold lower levels of TNFa. than non-autoimmune strains. Furthermore, this low TNF production was associated with a unique polymorphism in a simple tandem repeat sequence identified within the promoter region of TNFa. Most importantly, treatment of NZBxNZW mice with recombinant TNFo. caused a very significant reduction in the incidence of nephritis and other autoimmune disease parameters in the treated mice.  Further studies have revealed that: (1) TNF production is reduced also in a subset of patients with lupus, similarly to the (NZBxNZW)F1 mice that have an inherited lupus-like autoimmune diseasc. (2) Lupus patients with low TNF inducibility have a 3-5 fold increase in nephritis incidence; (3) In classical backcross experiments we showed that low TNF production in the NZW mouse is linked to the MHC,  In search of the mechanism of low TNF production in the lupus mouse, we have cloned and sequenced the 5’ regulatory regions from a total of 12 high- and low-TNF producer autoimmune and normal mouse strains as well as the 3'UTR of the TNF gene, from the stop codon at position 6215-6217 downstream (approximately 1.0 kb), in several strains. Several single bp mutations in the 5’region and nine sites were found to be associated with mutational events in the 3°UTR. The most interesting mutations were in the 3°UTR: a 5 base GACAC insertion at position 6381 and a 3 bp insertion of GAT, which disrupts the first AU-motif of TNFa. in the NZW mouse. To probe the functional relevance of the 5' regulatory regions and the 3'UTR mutations in the TNF gene, we have made constructs in which 5’ TNF promoter fragments from the low-TNF producer NZW mouse or from the high-TNF producer SWR mouse were linked to the luciferase reporter gene followed by 3'UTR sequences from the NZW mouse, or 3'UTR sequences from the non mutated SWR strain. The different constructs were transiently expressed in the RAW 264 cell line, activated with LPS and IFNy, and luciferase activity measured. Results published recently (J. Immunol. article enclosed) suggest that mutations in the 3’ untranslated region of the TNF gene may be primarily responsible for the genetic defect in NZW mice. It is noteworthy that, while luciferase activities are significantly reduced in the constructs with the 3'UTR originating from the NZW mouse, the level of luciferase mRNA is not affected suggesting that this is a post-transcriptional effect.  As a first step in investigating the regulatory mechanisms of TNF and their distinct signal transduction via each receptor, we considered isolation and characterization of the mouse receptors 10 be important. The cloning and sequencing of the TNF-R1 was recently completed and published.  We also cloned the mouse TNF-R2 and recently completed the sequence of the gene. We arc now in a strong position to be able to directly analyze and fully characterize the promoter of TNFR-2 in comparison with the promoter of TNFR-1. In parallel with cloning of the promoters of the receptors for regulatory studies, we have done regulatory experiments comparing the expression of the two TNF receptors using  50726195
__label__2 Hogue, Brenda G.  Human Coronavirus Receptors  Background and Significance  Coronaviruses are one of 14 RNA virus families that infect humans and a broad range of domestic animal species. Some of the viruses appear to be zoonotic. They are a medically important group of viruses exhibiting tropisms for the lung, intestine, liver, brain, kidney, eye, heart, and peritoneum resulting primarily in respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. In humans, they are known to cause acute respiratory infections and gastroenteritis. However, they have been implicated in association with acute lethal necrotizing enterocolites in children (Science 229:978, 1985), chronic enterocolites or Sprue (Dig. Dis.Sci. 27:1039, 1982), pericarditis (J. Med. Virol. 6:259, 1980) and multiple sclerosis (Science 209:933, 1980; Ann. Neurol. 31:525, 1992; Talbot et al, Virol, in press). Two recent studies show that a significant sample of multiple sclerosis brain tissue was positive when either specific probes or PCR were used to detect coronavirus nucleic acid (Ann, Neurol. 31:525, 1992; Talbot et al, Virol., in press). This is particularly significant since coronaviruses infect humans and could possibly serve as a cofactor in such a neurological disease. Recently a primate model was used to show that the primate CNS is susceptible to infection with coronaviruses (Virol 188:274, 1992). It has been clearly shown that coronaviruses can target to the brain of experimentally infected mice (Perlman, et al., 1989, 1990). It seems reasonable to postulate that such may also occur in humans during the course of a "normal respiratory infection" with these viruses. It is well documented that coronaviruses can readily establish persistence in both tissue culture and in the animal. This may apply to humans as well. Our proposed studies are significant in that they will increase our understanding of the initial step in infection of the human respiratory tract by coronaviruses and allow us to begin studies toward understanding how these viruses also infect the CNS.     Three receptors have been identified thus far for coronaviruses. The receptor for the mouse hepatitis coronavirus-A59 (MHV-A59) is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen family. Aminopeptidase N, also known as CD13, was recently identified as the receptor for the human coronavirus-229E and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) (Nature 357:417; 420, 1992). All of these coronaviruses have two major envelope proteins, the spike (S) and matrix (M). In all cases S interacts with the receptor. Some coronaviruses have, in addition to the S and M, a third major envelope protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE). BCV, a bovine coronavirus, expresses HE and this protein can use N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac3) as a receptor determinant to initiate an infection (J. Gen. Virol. 73:901, 1992). The data from this study suggests that a second receptor may be involved. The receptor(s) for the human coronavirus OC43 has not been identified. HCV-OC43 does bind Neu5,9Ac> on erythrocytes (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 85:4526); however, we do not know if :hig is a receptor determinant on cells that are normally infected by this virus. Data from

__label__6 UNEDITED TRANSLATION  RE: PRESENTATION BY PROFESSOR DR. SCHMAEHL IN BERLIN NOVEMBER 23, 1979 ,  Professor Schmaehl presented a lecture at the Berlin meeting of Clinicians and: Otorhinolaringoflogic Specialists on November 23, 1979, on the pathogenesis of malignant tu- mors in the oral cavity, larynx, esophagus and lung. There is no doubt that the attending doctors were strongly moved by the lecture. Prof. Schmachl knew how to present the relationships in a short period and illuminating manner, whereby the presentation was less scientific and more designed for a continuous education for the participatns. -In discussing the subject, Prof. Schmaeh] raturally included the problem of smoking and health. He presented the problem in a restrained ‘manner which is worth noticing. He emphasized the following:  1. Smoking is one risk factor among many and it is exclusively up to the smoker to decide whether he is willing to take the risk associated with smoking.  2. The introduction of filter cigarettes reduced very significantly the risk of smoking. It is possible that further progress in cigarette manufacture will lower. the risk still further. ,  3. The idea advanced by Prof. Oeser, that cancer deaths HF are "fate", may be correct. However, this concept can hardly satisfy a scientist. More so, because of the  evidence oY the possibility of cancer induction in  animal experiments and seemingly also in humans of  every age group with chemical substances and environ-  mental factors.  4. There are no indications that certain psychological dispositions play a role in carcinogenesis, the opposite may rather be the case.  5, The presentation lasted about 45 minutes, the subject of smokinr was dealt with for about five to ten minutes. The short .ime used for this subject should have created the impression that today's smoking can not be so dangerous.  November 27, 1979 Dr. F, Adlkofer  S@ZL Leoos
__label__9 FUR CONFIDENTIAL  f 1 cp  To: Mr. J, D. Weber  FROM: Ms. L. S. Firey/Ms. A. I. Williams  SUBJECT: Weekly Accomplishments  Product Guidance  @ An analysis of mean, actual and ideal product attribute ratings among 18-34 year old FF NM and FFLT NM smokers was conducted for the WINSTON brand research group to provide background information for the revised WINSTON product action standards. Although no statistical significant differences were run for this rating summary, the following similarities and differences are apparent: ,  - The FF NM 85mm female smokers appear to want a somewhat less strong, less harsh cigarette with less tobacco taste than the male counter- parte. However, all of their product ideal ratings in relation to their actual product ratings are in the same direction as the male category.  - The FFLT NM 85mm female smokers also appear to want a less strong, less harsh cigarette with lesa tobacco taste, as well as an easier draw. However, the female and male actual ratings are diametrically posi-~ tioned in relation to their ideals on strength and tobacco taste. Specifically, the females want a less strong tasting cigarette with slightly less tobacco taste, whereas the males want a stronger tasting cigarette with eignificantly more tobacco taste.  © A review of open-end responses from a recent Project SM Product Guidance Test was conducted to provide insight and ideas for the development of a new chewing tobacco questionnaire. Results indicate that respondents cite many quality of flavor and aroma attributes which are not asked on our current questionnaire. Many respondents mentioned fruit flavor, pipe tobacco flavor, artificial taste, sour taste, licorice taste and sweet aroma, Additionally, many respondents cited burning and biting sensa- tions from the tobacco, indicating a need to further explore the mouth feel dimension of the product.  e@ Preliminary results of the FFLT Tar Limit Study were presented to Applied R&D. Additional analyses are planned based on the conclusions reached from preliminary results. Maximum ratings for overall acceptance are associated with high tar levele. In general, of the two tar influencing variables studied, air dilution is of much greater importance than filter pressure in affecting attribute movement. Response surfaces for strength, tobacco taste, rich taste and natural taste all have contours similar to those for overall acceptance measures, with maximum ratings along ridges at moderate to lower air dilutions irrespective of filter pressure. Strength related attributes appear to be driving consumer  L62e 6b905

This is in accordance with similar studies, in which commercial or semi- purified diets were supplemented with 5 to 50 grams cholesterol/ kilogram diet (e. g. Goto et al., 1974, Rosnowska et al., 1978 and Renaud et al., 1979). The. serum cholesterol concentration obtained during the treatment period was markedly increased, but an unequi- vocal correlation between the cumulated cholesterol intake and the cholesterol serum concentration was not observed. In contrary the extent of fatty streaks in part 1 was numerically smaller than in part 2, the serum cholesterol concentration, however, was higher in part 1 than in part 2. This discrepancy shows, that the serum cholesterol level cannot be used for a prediction of atherogenic lesions in the aorta. -  The major parameter for the quantification of atherogenic lesions in this study was the occurence and the extent of fatty streaks in the thoracic (b) and the abdominal aorta of the rabbits. The term fatty streaks is used as a preliminary description of the athero- genic lesions observed. The histopathological description will be obtained after the histological examination of the aorta, which  will be reported separately.

Sensabaugh have recently conducted a series of experiments which resulted in cigarette smoke condensate displaying markedly reduced biological activity. These experiments involved the application of aqueous burley extract to flue-cured tobacco and preparation of cigarettes from the resultant treated flue-cured tobacco. Biological activity -was determined through use of Ames tests.  Investigation and developm t of this concept and a likely process for making ‘ees biologically active yet flavorful smoking products will include accitional experiments tsiaqg various solvents and extraction practices. ~ ent meetings with Gr. Rice cleared the way for us to begin extraction  -ties of sizable semples. We are to extract, or to have extracted by contracted means, at least three grades of burley tobaccos (must include KJOX) and use the extract to enhance three grades cf flue-cured tobaccos. Smoke condensate from resulting test cigarettes (burley extract enhanced flue-cured) will be given to Dr. Rice for biological assay.  we also understand that perhaps some or all the test Cigarettes should use expanded tobacco. We have just written a preliminary disclosure of a process invention covering the means for extract enhancement and friling value increase of tobacco/tobacco flavored material. In all iikelinocd, development anc commercialization of this new process will require and Justify design and construction of a bench scale pilot plant to be located either here or at Avoca,  We expect to begin extracting samples using conventional practices here this month and we are hopeful that the patent disclosure memorandum wil] clear the way for us to engage Muller Extract Company, GMBH for supercritical extraction/expansion studies. These studies wili both provide test material fur the RAN investi~-tisns and design knowledge to be needed for the likely pilot plant program.  Pe Cho $y age  B. Frank Niven Chariie ".

Last November, ABC agreed to proceed in refining research standrads and audit processes. The purpose of this Reader Profile Service was to enhance comparison of audience profiles of newspapers across the country.  You had asked me to remind you about this study in carly July so you could check on it when you attended the ABC meeting this month. I thought it might be interesting to get the results of the carly test participants. Newspaper readership could vary from market to market, especially given the availability of other "news" sources from market to market. A market with a strong alternative newspaper might skew the readership of the daily newspaper older, and if this press is non-existent, the 21-29 might be forced to read the daily newspaper to learn about club events, ctc. If you want the newsletter to refresh your memory - let me know and i'll give it to you.  joan  S869 e6ecs

__label__1 ADVERTISINC     Plans an Attack’ OnEPA Report  By EBEN SHAPIRO Staff Reporter of Tuk WALL STRERT JOURNAL The new management team at Philip Morris Cos. is going on the attack. . The company’s two top executives told Wall Street analysts in New York last night’  . that Philip Morris plans to unleash:a-  barrage of newspaper advertisements crit- ical of media coverage of the secondhand  . Smoke issue. The advertisements repro- .  duce parts of an article from Forbes*  -»MediaCritic magazine attacking medja  coverage of the possible hazards posed By - secondhand smoke. They will run asa series over, five days next week in major newspapers, including the New York. Times, the Washington Post and The Wall - Street Journal. The advertisements end with the slogan “In any controversy, facts _ must matter.” ia  The nation’s largest tobacco company has several reasons for the counterattacks. Competitors have privately criticized the company for sitting out much of this year’s frenzied debate on tobacco. Now its new chairman, R. William Murray, and presi dent and chief executive officer, Geoffrey | C. Bible, are eager to confirm Wall Street and employee expectations that they will be feistier combatants than their predeces- sor, Michael A. Miles, who resigned last week. Mr. Miles, a veteran of the food industry, was never comfortable jumping into the tobacco fray. o.  At a briefing with Mr. Murray and Mr. Bible on Tuesday, top managers at the company’s Miller Brewing unit asked several questions about how the company planned to fight back more effectively.  The advertisements also continue an industry assault on a government report that has had a major impact on the indus- try. RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., whichis running an extensive series of ads stress- ing ‘‘accommodation’’ on smoking issues, has already taken aim at the secondhand smoke report.  Philip Morris -        Hundreds of municipalities and corpo- rations have implemented harsh restric- tions on smoking based on a 1993 Environ: ment Protection Agency report claiming that secondhand smoke was responsible for about 3,000 lung-cancer deaths a year.. The industry has filed suit against the EPA, seeking to have the report with’. drawn, accusing the agency of ‘faulty. science.”  RJR has since expanded its campaign beyond secondhand smoke and recently ran an advertisement headlined “Today It’s Cigarettes. Tomorrow?” suggesting that bans on caffeine, alcohol and ham- burgers might be next.  Philip. Morris executives said addi- tional advertising beyond next week’s series of ads is likely but declined to be more specific. Despite the barrage of at- tacks on the industry, Philip Morris pre- viously ran issue advertising sparingly.  Inside the company, the more aggres- sive posture is seen as coming from Mr, Bible, the veteran tobacco executive who is known for responding swiftly to attacks, be it on the political front or from price-cut- ting rivals. .  At the same meeting with Wall Street analysts, Mr. Bible also projected higher. . than-expected profit for Philip Morris this year. Mr. Bible said Philip Morris's earn- ings for the year would be close to 1992  _ levels, when the company earned $5.45 a _share, according to analysts at the meet:  ing. The consensus estimate had been .  about $5.35 a share. The company didn’t  return calls seeking comment. A Gary Black, an analyst with Sanford C. °  Bernstein, said the new management is . -determined to prove that the domestic tobacco business remains highly profit-  able. “They are going to pick the highest number on the street and beat it,” Mr; Black said. ' But shareholders at the meeting were less bullish.

SCHULTHESS  em Nitrate electrode (1)  An Orion nitrate electrode is currently under test. The company claims that one can measure continuously the nitrate content in liquids.  Acid consumption (2) ©  Trials of the pilot plant showed different results concerning  the acid consumption in the NINO-process than those we have  found in the laboratory. We therefore determine these values again at different pH-values and initial phosphate concentrations. We could confirm the consumption of 31 g phosphoric acid (35 %) per liter of denitrated extract ata PH of 4.0. This value is independent of the dilution rate.  0,/CO,~Measurement (3) SA  Having still some troubles with our CO9/05 determination in the off-gas of fermenters we set up a continuous denitration using  a synthetic culture medium. In this trial we could show that we need at least 3 days to reach true steady-state conditions.  It however has to be mentioned that the denitration is also ® working without having a true steady-state. We try now to have analogous trials done in the laboratory and pilot plant fermenters  Cellulase (4)     The production of cellulase by Trichoderma viride DSM 769 was further tested. An addition of glucose at a maximal level of '0.2 % increases the yield of this enzyme. The same is true by using Tween 80 in a concentration between 0.1 and 0.5 3%.  Freeze-dryer  The freeze-dryer has been received and tested. We are able to produce freeze-dryed Ninomass and can now cover the needs of the Richmond flavor department.  4 - 2501124648

Block, Freda Camuzsi, Waiter Voiqt, and Albert Castro*  Departments of Pathology, Urology and Hormone Research Laboratory University of Miami School of Medicine Miami, Florida  ABSTRACT -  Bicchemical entagonism between heparin and ascorbic acid was described (Owen et. al., 1970). Ascorbic acid is found in high concentrations in adrenal and testicular tissue and piays an important role in steroid synthesis in these tissues. To determine  s with ascorbic acid, levels of testosterone were studied in testi- cular tissue of adult male Syrian golden hamsters and in testicular | plasma of adult male Sprague-Dawiey rats during heparin treatment.     To determine concentrations of testosterone in tissue the double isotepe derivative assay method was used, Radioimmunoassay was used to detexmine testosterone concentrations in plasme., Wo inhibitory effect was Getected when testosterone comeentrutions in  ~ the treated groups were compared with these in the control groups.  INTRODUCTION  The interplay of sex hormones has been known to be associated with ascorbic acid metabolism in various animals, Testosterone - administration to castrated male albiro rats was found to restore hepatic contents of ascorbic acid metabolites to the shum control levels (Khandwekar et. al., 1974).

Qualitatively, Marlboro was perceived to have a "milder taste" and to be "less harsh". A large percentage of the Marlboro Lights smokers preferred their own brand because it was milder.  Among the Benson & Hedges Lights 100mm NMF smokers, no significant differences were indicated on preference between the Marlboro Lights 100mm cigarettes (50%) and Benson & Hedges Lights 100mm (50%). Qualitatively, Benson & Hedges was perceived to be "more satisfying" and to "have an easier draw''. Marlboro was perceived to have a "milder taste" and to be "less harsh".  The cross section of other flavor low 100mm NMF smokers significantly preferred (at 90% confidence level) the Benson & Hedges Lights cigarettes (56%) to Marlboro Lights 100mm (44%). Qualitatively, BSH was perceived to be "more satisfying". Marlboro Lights was perceived to be “less harsh". ;  Distribution:  T. Beane  D. Beran  D. Dangoor  S. Fuller |  E. Gee (Richmond)  E.

DONALD deBETHIZY, Ph.D. Director, Biological Research Research and Development  May 24, 1994 Bowman Gray Technical Center  Winston-Salem, NC 27104 910-741-2638 Fax 910-741-7472  To: Distribution  Subject: Promotion of Carr J. Smith, Ph.D.  It is with great pleasure that we announce Dr. Carr Smith’s promotion to Senior Staff Scientist in Research & Development. Carr has been with R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company since 1986, performing a variety of critical functions for the Company. He has been in the Product Evaluation Group since November 1992. Over the past eighteen months, his work in meeting the objectives of the Product Evaluation Group, formerly the Biological Research Group, has been exemplary. We are pleased to recognize Carr’s efforts with this promotion.  One of the major things that Carr has been able to accomplish in the brief time he has worked with us is to initiate a program in the area of human cardiovascular disease. Carr has accepted the challenge to build this program and has made significant progress to reach his goal. He has carefully reviewed the literature and written several review articles on the relationship between smoking and cardiovascular disease. One major conclusion is that the cardiovascular risks of smoking and nicotine use have been grossly exaggerated by individuals outside the Company. These articles are being submitted for publication in peer reviewed journals. Additionally, Carr has been actively involved in studies with smokers to support product development efforts. Carr’s depth of knowledge in human clinical studies is invaluable to all of us. He has been a critical participant in our continuing efforts to bring scientific rigor to the question of the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke. Carr was actively involved in responding to the EPA and he has a key role in our current attempts to educate OSHA on the scientific facts.  In summary, Carr Smith has been and is performing at a level consistent with the duties and responsibilities of a Senior Staff Scientist at R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. We are delighted to have him as part of our team. We look forward to his continuing efforts to provide balance in scientific discussions of the biological activity of tobacco smoke, particularly in the area of cardiovascular disease. Please join us as we congratulate Carr on his achievements.  J. Don deBethizy “We work for smokers avid J. Doolittle     OSPE C9OTS

Di Marco  ITEMS FOR WEEXLY BRIEF  Cigarette Banding Policy - Representatives from MDD, Brands R&D and R&D Technica rvices met to discuss procedures currently used for banding test products. Changes in the tipping design and perforation location over the past few years have required that the R&D Plant change the banding location on some products. This has caused Some concern within MDD in com- Paring data from tests with the different locations. A new policy will be written by mid-April, Setting standards for banding width and location for each style that may be run to ensure long-term consistency within each brand style. Cases where uniquely designed tipping make these Standards unacceptable will be discussed with MDD and Brands before banding.  Study to Improve Stem Extracton for G7 - Analytical support is being pro- vided to Tobacco Processing to evaluate modifications in the extraction procedure used in the preparation of stems for G7. The study is related to the higher nitrate content of G7 resulting from the addition of whitewater from burley stems in the process.
